# LM Studio Health Check Fix

## Overview
This document describes the fix applied to the LM Studio container health check issue in the Living Truth Engine project.

## Problem
The LM Studio container (`lmstudioai/llmster-preview:latest`) was showing as "unhealthy" despite the service running correctly. The health check was failing because it was trying to use `curl` which is not available in the LM Studio container.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Health Check**: The LM Studio service in the `notebook_agent` docker-compose file didn't have a health check configured.
2. **Tool Availability**: The LM Studio container doesn't include `curl`, `wget`, or `python` by default.
3. **Wrong Docker Compose File**: The containers were running from `/home/mccoy/Projects/RippleAGI/notebook_agent/docker/docker-compose.yml`, not from the LivingTruthEngine directory.

## Solution
Added a proper health check using TCP connection testing instead of HTTP requests:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "timeout 10 bash -c '</dev/tcp/localhost/1234' || exit 1"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 60s
```

## Implementation Details

### Health Check Method
- **TCP Connection Test**: Uses `/dev/tcp/localhost/1234` to test if the port is listening
- **Timeout Protection**: 10-second timeout prevents hanging health checks
- **Bash Shell**: Uses `CMD-SHELL` to execute bash commands
- **Error Handling**: Returns exit code 1 if connection fails

### Configuration Location
- **File**: `/home/mccoy/Projects/RippleAGI/notebook_agent/docker/docker-compose.yml`
- **Service**: `lm-studio`
- **Container Name**: `living_truth_lm_studio`

### Port Mapping
- **Internal Port**: 1234 (container)
- **External Port**: 1234 (host)
- **Health Check**: Tests internal port 1234

## Verification

### Before Fix
```bash
# Container status
docker ps | grep lm_studio
# Output: ... (unhealthy) ...

# Health check logs
docker inspect living_truth_lm_studio --format='{{range .State.Health.Log}}{{.Output}}{{end}}'
# Output: OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: unable to start container process: exec: "curl": executable file not found in $PATH
```

### After Fix
```bash
# Container status
docker ps | grep lm_studio
# Output: ... (healthy) ...

# Manual health check test
docker exec living_truth_lm_studio timeout 10 bash -c '</dev/tcp/localhost/1234' && echo "Health check passed"
# Output: Health check passed
```

## Service Status
- ✅ **LM Studio**: Healthy and operational
- ✅ **API Endpoint**: http://localhost:1234/v1/models
- ✅ **Health Check**: TCP connection test working
- ✅ **Container**: Running in notebook_agent project group

## Related Services
All services in the notebook_agent project group are now healthy:
- ✅ **PostgreSQL**: Port 5434 (healthy)
- ✅ **Neo4j**: Ports 7474/7687 (healthy)
- ✅ **Redis**: Port 6379 (healthy)
- ✅ **Langflow**: Port 7860 (healthy)
- ✅ **LM Studio**: Port 1234 (healthy)
- ✅ **Living Truth Engine**: Ports 8000-8001 (healthy)

## Best Practices Applied
1. **Tool Availability**: Use tools available in the container
2. **Lightweight Health Checks**: TCP test is faster than HTTP
3. **Proper Timeouts**: Prevent hanging health checks
4. **Error Handling**: Clear exit codes for health status
5. **Container-Specific**: Tailored to LM Studio container capabilities

## Future Considerations
- Monitor health check performance
- Consider adding more comprehensive health checks if needed
- Update health check configuration if LM Studio container changes
- Document any future health check modifications

---

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - LM Studio health check is now working correctly.
