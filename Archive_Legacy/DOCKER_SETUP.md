# Living Truth Engine - Docker Setup Guide

## 🐳 Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the Living Truth Engine using Docker containers. This approach ensures consistent environments across different systems and simplifies deployment.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Linux system (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- User with sudo privileges
- Internet connection for downloading Docker images

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run the Setup Script

```bash
# Make sure you're in the LivingTruthEngine directory
cd /home/mccoy/Projects/NotebookLM/LivingTruthEngine

# Activate the virtual environment
source living_venv/bin/activate

# Run the Docker setup script
./setup_docker.sh
```

### 2. Manual Setup (if script fails)

If the automated script doesn't work, follow these manual steps:

#### Install Docker
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

**Important**: Log out and back in after adding user to docker group.

#### Create Directories
```bash
mkdir -p logs config tests docs scripts models .flowise
```

#### Update Environment Variables
Edit the `.env` file with your actual API keys:
```bash
nano .env
```

#### Start Services
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The Docker setup includes the following services:

### Core Services
- **Flowise** (Port 3000): AI workflow orchestration
- **PostgreSQL** (Port 5432): Database with pgvector extension
- **LM Studio** (Port 1234): Local model inference
- **Dashboard** (Port 8050): Web-based monitoring interface

### Supporting Services
- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server
- **Redis**: Caching and session management

```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables need to be configured in `.env`:

#### Required API Keys
- `FLOWISE_API_KEY`: Your Flowise API key
- `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`: Your LangSmith API key
- `SERP_API_KEY`: Your SerpAPI key

#### Service Configuration
- `FLOWISE_CHATFLOW_ID`: ID of your Flowise chatflow (currently: 9f8013d8-351a-4bd9-a973-fab86df45491)
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database password
- `DASHBOARD_PORT`: Dashboard port (default: 8050)

### Service URLs

Once running, services will be available at:
- **Flowise**: http://localhost:3000
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:8050
- **LM Studio**: http://localhost:1234
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432

## 🛠️ Management Commands

### Start Services
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Stop Services
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### View Logs
```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs

# Specific service
docker-compose logs flowise
docker-compose logs postgres
docker-compose logs dashboard
```

### Restart Services
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Rebuild Services
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Check Service Status
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Permission Denied
```bash
# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in
```

#### 2. Port Already in Use
```bash
# Check what's using the port
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :3000

# Stop conflicting service or change port in docker-compose.yml
```

#### 3. Docker Service Not Running
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

#### 4. Insufficient Disk Space
```bash
# Clean up Docker images
docker system prune -a

# Check disk usage
df -h
```

### Health Checks

Each service includes health checks. Monitor them with:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

### Log Analysis

Check logs for errors:
```bash
# Recent logs
docker-compose logs --tail=100

# Follow logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Code Changes
Make changes to your Python files in the project directory.

### 2. Rebuild and Restart
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 3. Test Changes
Access the dashboard at http://localhost:8050

### 4. View Logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f dashboard
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Dashboard
Access the web dashboard at http://localhost:8050 for:
- System health monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Real-time logs
- Service status

### Health Checks
All services include health checks that monitor:
- Service availability
- Response times
- Error rates
- Resource usage

## 🔐 Security

### Network Security
- Services are isolated in Docker networks
- Only necessary ports are exposed
- Internal communication uses Docker networking

### Data Security
- Database passwords are stored in environment variables
- API keys are kept secure in `.env` file
- Volumes are properly mounted for data persistence

### Access Control
- Services run with minimal required privileges
- User permissions are properly configured
- Docker group membership is required

## 🚀 Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Configure proper API keys
   - Set appropriate log levels

2. **Configure Reverse Proxy**
   - Set up nginx or Apache
   - Configure SSL certificates
   - Set up proper domain names

3. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Configure external monitoring
   - Set up log aggregation
   - Configure alerts

4. **Backup Strategy**
   - Configure database backups
   - Set up volume backups
   - Test recovery procedures

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Review service logs
3. Verify environment configuration
