00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.400
Heavenly Father, today we put on the full armor&nbsp;
to protect us against attack. We put on the belt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.840
of truth to protect against lies and deception. We&nbsp;
put on the breastplate of righteousness to protect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.760
our hearts from the temptations. We put the gospel&nbsp;
of peace on our feet to walk in your light, peace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.200
and freedom with the Holy Spirit. We rebuke&nbsp;
anxious thoughts. We take up your shield of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.400
faith for protection to block and destroy all&nbsp;
the darts and threats thrown at us by the enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.120
We put on the helmet of salvation to cover&nbsp;
our minds and thoughts, reminding us that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.440
are children of a mighty king. We are forgiven,&nbsp;
set free, saved by the blood of Jesus. We take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.760
up the sword of the spirit, your living word&nbsp;
that has the power to demolish strongholds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.040
and is sharper than any double-edged sword. We&nbsp;
come to you, Lord, in prayer daily. In Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:57.280
mighty name we pray. Amen. Amen. What's up, you&nbsp;
guys? Welcome to the Imagination. I'm your host,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.960
Emma, and today I'm absolutely honored to&nbsp;
introduce you all to satanic ritual abuse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.120
MK Ultra Mind Control, covert experimentation,&nbsp;
an organized abuse survivor, whistleblower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.680
and overcomer, artist and painter, writer,&nbsp;
songwriter, spiritual conduit, and healer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.040
and a woman who transforms the unspeakable into&nbsp;
a testament of the soul's unyielding sovereignty.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.160
Magnolia Dove, born into a lineage marked by&nbsp;
survival and struggle. Magnolia's story began with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.480
roots in her mother's Holocaust survivor heritage&nbsp;
and a rare AB positive bloodline, which made her a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.960
target immediately from birth. While the specifics&nbsp;
of generational abuse remain partly shrouded,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.040
the echoes of trauma reverberated through her&nbsp;
family. Her childhood spent in the loving yet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.640
dysfunctional embrace of her parents, an only&nbsp;
child navigating her father's cocaine addiction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.400
was marred by early dissociation, a survival&nbsp;
mechanism that veiled her earliest memories.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.880
At age 5, the darkness descended fully, Magnolia&nbsp;
became a target of ritual abuse and mind control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.280
Ins snared by perpetrators tied to MK Ultra and&nbsp;
Stargate projects, the sisters of Darkness Coven,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.880
and even her best friend's parents who were linked&nbsp;
to the Warner Brothers and Hollywood circles. Her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.880
formative years were a battleground at private&nbsp;
school and later in public schools. Magnolia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.440
was subjected to routine programming even as she&nbsp;
excelled in her school's gate programs. The abuse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.200
was harrowing. satanic rituals where she was hung&nbsp;
upside down, adrenalized blood being extracted,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.520
a shallow coffin burial with snakes and bugs,&nbsp;
electroshock wands, starvation and padded rooms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.480
bamboo shoots under her fingernails, and more&nbsp;
as part of her brutal traumabased mind control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.040
programming. At Warner Brothers linked gatherings,&nbsp;
she even endured child adult fetish parties,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.400
a grim echo of the movie Eyed Wise Shut.&nbsp;
These horrors, layered with drug-induced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.800
programming and near-death experiences, sought to&nbsp;
fracture her spirit. The abuse began to wne around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.680
age nine when key perpetrators, including&nbsp;
her primary babysitter and sexual abuser,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.320
moved away. MK Ultra's grip loosened, though&nbsp;
sporadic access for programming persisted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.840
Magnolia buried these memories deep, blocking&nbsp;
them out into adulthood, a survival strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.680
that allowed her to move forward until the past&nbsp;
demanded reckoning. Just over a decade ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.800
a chilling memory of a perpetrator's Russian&nbsp;
roulette threat unlocked a flood of memories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.480
linked to satanic ritual abuse. Over the next few&nbsp;
years, the pieces coalesed, revealing the truth of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.480
her life that had been mentally compartmentalized.&nbsp;
Magnolia's healing journey has been as fierce as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.400
her survival. Initially, her treatments offered&nbsp;
little emotional support and trauma rehab provided&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.480
only surface level understanding of her complex&nbsp;
trauma and PTSD. Her true healing came through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.040
unconventional and holistic paths and a profound&nbsp;
connection to Jesus Christ through deliverance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.200
Today, Magnolia stands as a whole, vibrant soul&nbsp;
with many memories integrated, yet ever curious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.520
about the gaps in her story. Her decision to speak&nbsp;
out is driven by a desire to provide hope, to fill&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.440
in other survivors fragmented memories, and to&nbsp;
reclaim her testimony. As a songwriter, painter,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.040
writer, and healer, she is a master at turning&nbsp;
the painful into the beautiful into creations that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.040
resonate with ancient wisdom and urgent relevance.&nbsp;
her work as a lifeline for those navigating the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.600
liinal space between trauma and transcendence.&nbsp;
As a radiant vessel of Yeshua's divine light,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.360
Magnolia channels transformative healing messages&nbsp;
and profound spiritual wisdom, guiding those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.800
yearning for restoration and truth through their&nbsp;
deepest wounds. With unwavering devotion, she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.880
creates a sacred sanctuary for survivors of ritual&nbsp;
abuse, SRRA, and mind control, offering services&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.200
like deliverance, boundless compassion, and a path&nbsp;
to wholeness and reintegration. Magnolia's voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.520
is soft yet unshakable. Her art a bridge between&nbsp;
worlds, her healing practice, a restoration of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.920
what was stolen. She is more than just a survivor.&nbsp;
She is a warriorist and a thor proving that even&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.360
the darkest experiences be transformed into&nbsp;
light. Through her testimony, Magnolia invites&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.680
others to reclaim their sovereignty, offering a&nbsp;
message of hope. Quote, "The shadows may wound,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.960
but the spirit endures, and in its resilience, it&nbsp;
creates beauty that cannot be erased." End quote.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.560

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.520
shift to alternative streaming platforms such&nbsp;
as Rumble and X recently following the extreme&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.040
censorship that caused my last YouTube channel&nbsp;
to be terminated. I've just recently started a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.320

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.640
crucial to continue sharing vital information&nbsp;

thank you all on the other side of the screen&nbsp;

brightest light in a world of darkness, the one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.920
the only Magnolia Dove. Magnolia, thank you so&nbsp;
much for being here with us today. It's such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:36.080
an honor to have you on. Wow. Thank you so much.&nbsp;
That was such an amazing introduction. It It made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:44.800
me emotional. You're so worthy of it. You deserve&nbsp;
pages of an intro. Uh I'm that didn't go on for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:51.360
half the show. I could have said so much more&nbsp;
about you. Um incredible. I am I was blown away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.520
by the harrowing details that you shared with your&nbsp;
story. And then once we finally got to connect and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:02.000
I heard your voice, I was just aruck with how&nbsp;
positive, with how upbeat, and I know it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.160
like that every single day, but just seeing the&nbsp;
woman that you are today and what you've overcome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:11.520
and then understanding where you came from is just&nbsp;
it's a miracle in itself. And I'm really thrilled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.320
that you've decided to come on here and share with&nbsp;
others. I think you have a really big piece to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:22.320
puzzle on so many different levels for people. you&nbsp;
have a really comprehensive story that goes beyond&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:29.760
um a lot of different uh scenarios, industries,&nbsp;
socio and economic classes. I mean, there's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.120
a lot of different layers I think that people&nbsp;
will be able to connect with and get puzzle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.880
pieces from, you know, and I think um you're&nbsp;
a wonderful representative for this community,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.400
and I'm just really honored and proud of you&nbsp;
for coming on and sharing your testimony for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:50.320
the first time like this. Wow. Thank you so much&nbsp;
for having me. Um and that amazing introduction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:58.560
and you know we forget things about ourselves&nbsp;
sometimes like it's you know a nice reminder you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:08.400
know when we're when we are with ourselves our&nbsp;
our entire lives we you know we forget that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:13.920
did really overcome all of that. it's easy to kind&nbsp;
of go into like well what am I not doing or what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:25.840
could I be doing better and the crit you know the&nbsp;
criticism or um so thank you it it's I do I also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:36.480
feel that it has you know watching other survivors&nbsp;
come forward listening to other testimonies I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:47.600
been you know just knowing wow my story kind of&nbsp;
bridges to that and and because I experienced,

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:57.440
you know, sort of different pockets of it. I Yes,&nbsp;
I do feel that this could fill in gaps for people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:05.360
It it definitely brings more clarity and&nbsp;
understanding which is important for just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:14.560
all of us like a reckoning of of coming to terms&nbsp;
with that this is really happening on this planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:24.720
Um sometimes I think it's just so unbelievable&nbsp;
for people to recognize. I couldn't agree more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:31.600
and people aren't wrong. It is. These are the most&nbsp;
heinous crimes. It literally is too unbelievable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.160
and crazy sometimes to even wrap your mind around.&nbsp;
Even when you do believe it, just hearing some of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:41.280
these things that that somebody like you has&nbsp;
overcome and at such a young age, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:47.280
and and these impossible scenarios and decisions&nbsp;
and choices that you had to make as just a small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:54.000
child, you know, and it really is it's it's a&nbsp;
huge shock to the world, but ultimately, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.280
this really is the reality that we're living in.&nbsp;
And a lot of this stuff could be very preventable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:05.120
It could be exposed, you know, and and it could&nbsp;
have some sort of justice in the form of stopping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:10.960
it and helping survivors on the other end of it&nbsp;
who are ignored and erased and silenced, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:16.960
and and sharing these testimonies, I think, is a&nbsp;
way to do that. It's a way to create validation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:23.040
to create cooperation, and on the other side of&nbsp;
that to to help other survivors who are just going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:27.680
through it, you know, know that they're not alone.&nbsp;
and that other people have gone through things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.120
like they have and that they aren't crazy cuz of&nbsp;
course you're going to think that you are. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.400
stuff literally does. It sounds crazy to hear. I&nbsp;
can't imagine remembering it and oh yeah, like oh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:43.920
my god that happened, you know. So of course, of&nbsp;
course people have a hard time believing it, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:49.200
it's still happening and we really have to help&nbsp;
society understand that so they feel empowered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:54.080
and ready to to stop it, you know, and help expose&nbsp;
it. And so it's really important what what you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.960
doing. Um, I'm excited to talk about the work&nbsp;
that you do. You actually work with survivors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:06.640
which is amazing. And you have an incredible story&nbsp;
from, you know, these the absolute most darkest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:11.440
heinous things in the world to finding the divine&nbsp;
light, you know, and and everything in between.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.800
So, I'm excited to sort of go on this journey with&nbsp;
you. Um, so I thought maybe if it's okay with you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:22.960
we'd sort of paint the scene a little bit. So,&nbsp;
you're you're an only child and so maybe if I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.120
know that that your family history is still a&nbsp;
little bit spotty and we obviously want to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:34.720
privacy respected for your safety and uh you&nbsp;
know and for protection. Um but do you want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.640
share a little bit about your family background?&nbsp;
Anything that you do know that might be important&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.560
to your story and then we can start talking&nbsp;
about your childhood after that. Yeah. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:56.000
um, I was born and raised in eastern Long Island&nbsp;
in the Hamptons, in East Hampton. My family, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:07.600
my parents are from the Bronx. My mother's side&nbsp;
is, so from my grandmother's side of my mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:15.840
she's a Holocaust survivor. So she came over from&nbsp;
Hungary with her sister and actually nine of her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:25.680
brothers and sisters were killed allegedly in&nbsp;
different concentration camps. And so my mother's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:34.640
mother came here really not knowing anyone,&nbsp;
you know, having a few connections with family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:45.680
her sister as one and some cousins and went to&nbsp;
work in a bar in like a a beauty parlor and was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:58.880
raising my mother barely speaking English and&nbsp;
um you know, a a very kind uh woman who was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:06.960
landlord of my grandmother kind of took my mother&nbsp;
in in a lot of ways. And I think that that's that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:15.760
had a a lot to do with my mother turning out good&nbsp;
on many levels, even though this has happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:29.040
uh to me. And I and I still have some questions&nbsp;
to whether she was an MK Ultra survivor directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:41.520
Um because of that, I'm not sure. my father's&nbsp;
side are uh mostly Romanian and Russian. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:48.960
we're originally on the Hungarian side. The origin&nbsp;
is actually Transylvania on the border. So it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:59.120
that like how I've kind of like come to terms with&nbsp;
it is it's that that Roma psychic bloodline. you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:07.680
know, there's a lot of that um kind of heightened&nbsp;
awareness in that bloodline. And um but as far as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:14.640
on my father's side, I really haven't been able&nbsp;
to get much history. I know that he was in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:25.200
army for a short period of time as a chef. And I&nbsp;
think he was raised like pretty middle to upper&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:35.280
middle class. And my mother was raised pretty poor&nbsp;
uh lower class and is a self-made woman. But I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:47.760
born in New York City in Mount Sinai Hospital&nbsp;
and a C-section baby and really spent my whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:59.120
childhood mostly in East Hampton, born and raised.&nbsp;
And we did spend a few months out of the year in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:08.000
the Turks and Caos. They had a beach house there&nbsp;
that they had when they first met they were like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:19.200
sort of traveling hippies and they decided to&nbsp;
build a house there. And so we would go there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:26.080
for yeah a few months out of the year. I would&nbsp;
do a little bit of schooling there. My schooling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:33.920
though was extremely spotty with the amount&nbsp;
of schools I went to before the age of eight.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:42.480
And so your parents from what you know um they&nbsp;
and one thing too that that you had mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:48.000
which I thought was significant was your dad had&nbsp;
addiction problems you know which which a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.040
times can be a symptom of trauma you know&nbsp;
and and adults trying to contend with that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.920
So even though you don't know for sure, it does&nbsp;
sort of seem like even if your parents didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.880
go through what you did, maybe they had been&nbsp;
victimized in some way throughout their life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:10.640
just with how the people that they were around and&nbsp;
sort of some of the um some of the the symptoms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.960
maybe that they were showing a little bit that&nbsp;
maybe you could notice now as an adult looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:21.600
back that you didn't necessarily see as a child.&nbsp;
Yes. Yeah, there was I I remember them having like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:29.120
a lot of hippie artist kind of parties and I do&nbsp;
remember my father holding me when I was little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:37.360
and and feeling that he was out of it, that&nbsp;
he was in pain and because I'm such an empath,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:47.200
I I could feel that off of him. Um, and my mother&nbsp;
admits that up until I think I was maybe up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:53.520
she says up until I was four, but it could have&nbsp;
gone on longer, but that he struggled and that at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.520 --> 00:18:02.640
one point she was going to leave him if he didn't&nbsp;
stop. And then he absolutely did stop. Uh, and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:11.920
also want to point out that one of my main sexual&nbsp;
perpetrators is linked directly to my father with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:25.840
drugs. Whether he targeted my father because of&nbsp;
the group, the babysitter. It was a a group of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:35.040
babysitters, three women, um that did daytime&nbsp;
traffic us. And it's possible that that is his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:43.760
linked link to my father. Uh or but it's a it was&nbsp;
a small community is my point. And they definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:54.720
were involved in drug use slash um distribution&nbsp;
like drug dealing together. And I do have memories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:06.880
of being left with this man alone. Sorry, that's&nbsp;
horrifying. Mhm. Looking back at your childhood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:12.960
you do and people understand what we're talking&nbsp;
about with layers and like different um sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:19.680
compartments of society in a sense that your story&nbsp;
intertwines with and industries. when did maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:27.120
the first abuse or dysfunction start in in your&nbsp;
life as a child? And maybe we can sort of unfold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:34.080
it in order as they um as these different people&nbsp;
and these different industries and different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:46.160
um layers sort of start piling on each&nbsp;
other. Okay. So, I mean it is hard to know

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.600
the first abuse because

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:57.440
it depends on what abuse we're talking about.&nbsp;
Like the first time I was taken to a safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:08.640
house I feel was very early. I feel like I&nbsp;
was not preverbal but just verbal enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:22.480
four or five a as early as four or five where um I&nbsp;
was taken all of the abuse really feels the way my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:30.400
memories had come up was because they came up and&nbsp;
you know I had repressed them. the first memories&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:41.520
that came up and sometimes I think the mind will&nbsp;
show you the first almost screen memories that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:54.000
aren't maybe as bad or severe as others. So it's&nbsp;
as your psyche can handle them. So, I did start to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:06.320
remember in 2010 that there was a man and I'm&nbsp;
almost like, should I just say his name? Uh,

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:14.240
his name was Bobby. And he he would sexually&nbsp;
abuse me. He would sexually abuse his own family&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:28.480
members, his stepdaughter and and biological&nbsp;
son and stepson. And I was left alone with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:36.800
I was accessed by him at the babysitters&nbsp;
who had had trafficked us during the day&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:45.040
and were planning to sell my virginity&nbsp;
because I witnessed that conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:53.760
I witnessed a lot of things in that&nbsp;
in that in that um trafficking circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.680
It was a satanic cult, the Sisters&nbsp;
of Darkness, and they were involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:10.880
in trafficking for money-making purposes,&nbsp;
obviously. And I remember being downstairs

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:18.960
uh very late with this babysitter and we were&nbsp;
my mother was late to pick me up and so she had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:26.560
me come down with her to fold laundry. And there&nbsp;
was another woman over who was connected to her,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:33.200
also a neighborhood babysitter that would have&nbsp;
these groups of kids over over to her house. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:44.640
she was talking about the business of trafficking&nbsp;
children and like talking her into it. And I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:55.520
just remember them speaking about like she was&nbsp;
convincing this other babysitter to do this, that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:07.840
her husband wouldn't have to work three jobs, um&nbsp;
that she has all of this access to children. And

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:17.440
you know, it's hard to put a total timeline&nbsp;
on it, but I believe within a few weeks of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:25.840
that is when a lot of this operation really&nbsp;
started going. And sometimes it was someone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.600
you know, paying to watch a child get humiliated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:40.800
like watch a child eat something off of&nbsp;
the floor. Um, acting out sexually. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:52.480
just spending time alone with a child. sometimes&nbsp;
putting on uh plays and entertaining adults. And

00:23:52.480 --> 00:24:07.680
then what became apparent was the spiritual&nbsp;
component, the satanic element to this. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:19.280
I have they used to kind of argue who got to be&nbsp;
uh I guess what is it? Glenda the good witch of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:27.600
the of the Wizard of Oz, right? Is it? And I&nbsp;
mean they were fullon witches and they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:33.200
talking about the name of their coven which&nbsp;
they ended up calling it Sisters of Darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.080
And I remember the conversation about&nbsp;
they liked the band Sisters of Mercy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:47.120
So like how about Sisters of Darkness?&nbsp;
But it was very clear that there were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:53.120
people above them that were teaching these&nbsp;
principles that they got to have their own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:53.120 --> 00:25:05.360
like backyard coven but that they were not the&nbsp;
higher upper echelons of this and but they did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:18.880
a lot of torturous things and I like I have one&nbsp;
memory where I was in their yard playing and the

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:28.080
this woman, Alice, one of the women, came over&nbsp;
to me and said, "We're going to play a game."&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:36.640
And she strapped she put these like gravity&nbsp;
boots on me of some some kind. Uh I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:44.640
I didn't even know what they were. and she picked&nbsp;
me up by my feet and hung me off of something how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:52.960
I see it as it was like a a laundry tea that&nbsp;
probably had like hooks and I was hung upside&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:52.960 --> 00:26:01.680
down and she said Jesus went through this and&nbsp;
walked away and waited for me to get into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:11.760
very panicked state and then came back over and I&nbsp;
mean I was trying to get my head with, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:18.240
all the blood rushing to your head like that, it's&nbsp;
really uncomfortable. And so I was trying to like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:28.000
bend my body up so I could get my head above&nbsp;
my heart. And um and she came back and said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.520
"Are you scared? Are you panicked?" And I was&nbsp;
like, "Yes, yes, please." Begging for them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:43.440
get me down. And she just took a syringe off&nbsp;
the back of my spine and took extracted blood,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:51.040
which I have come to understand that that's&nbsp;
adrenalized blood. And I would watch these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:51.040 --> 00:27:00.560
witches get high on it and talk about how amazing&nbsp;
they felt. And they would say things like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:06.960
"Wait till you've been, you know, I feel like&nbsp;
I'm 18 again." And then like one of the others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:20.640
who was more experienced in it would would say,&nbsp;
"Wait till you've been on this for a month." And

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:34.320
I remember them um keeping what I think were&nbsp;
likely child parts from how I remember it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.680
And of course, you know, when we come up with&nbsp;
these memories, when they these surface, like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:47.680
we're like, are am I crazy? Um, but I remember a&nbsp;
conversation of, "How do we know that the blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:56.000
isn't infected with AIDS?" It was the '8s. Um,&nbsp;
and they were like, "Oh, Dr. So and so, like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:04.800
I guess it was their network work doctor tests all&nbsp;
the blood." Um, and they would I think they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:15.440
eating like some kind of bone marrow. They also&nbsp;
were while abusing children and myself, they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:24.000
also training me and a select few of the kids,&nbsp;
especially the ones they had the most access to.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:32.800
So yeah, I was like in training to be one&nbsp;
of them in their and I was eventually then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:46.240
hazed into their coven and um that would be&nbsp;
the day that they did the mock coffin burial

00:28:46.240 --> 00:29:01.840
which feels like one of my most extreme extreme&nbsp;
extremely traumatic days. And so that was a long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:13.760
weekend where this babysitter, this main&nbsp;
babysitter was was my parents were working&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:24.560
and they were away. They used to do put on these&nbsp;
like flea markets and antique shows and it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:33.280
I believe a long weekend that they were leaving&nbsp;
for work and this babysitter came to stay at my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:40.000
house which in my head I thought oh well she'll&nbsp;
be she'll be more well behaved because it's my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:52.320
house and obviously that was not the case and&nbsp;
she invited the coven over and there were some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:52.320 --> 00:30:01.280
children there that I didn't know that were&nbsp;
not a part of the normal play group and I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:10.720
come to understand the term like expendable&nbsp;
children and yeah and so there was this one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:22.720
boy Elijah and they he around my age and I was&nbsp;
around age six and they had us play together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:31.040
They were they were just um encouraging us to&nbsp;
play and then they would throw out little terms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:40.480
like you guys are soulmates now, you guys&nbsp;
are bonded. Um this is like your brother.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.280
And then they would flip the script the&nbsp;
script. They they flipped the script on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:54.000
me and and they said, "Now you can either watch us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:03.520
torture him to death or you can kill&nbsp;
him and put him out of his misery."

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:09.280
And I didn't like either of those&nbsp;
choices. And they said, "And if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:22.720
comply with us. If you don't listen to what we&nbsp;
tell you to do, we're going to kill your parents.

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:30.560
And just a side note, I just want to say that&nbsp;
during all these different abuse scenarios that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:38.400
happened, these people would use whatever worked&nbsp;
in that moment. It was either sometimes it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:44.880
be your family knows we're your real family,&nbsp;
you know, like and because you're being abused,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:55.840
you're dissociating each and every um&nbsp;
scenario. So, I did not like that option,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:06.560
but they actually started to physically abuse him&nbsp;
in front of me. the men were doing this. There&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:18.720
were men connected, one being uh one of my main&nbsp;
perpetrators and they started to twist his like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:30.720
dislocate his arm and at a certain point he just&nbsp;
screamed and said just get it over with to me.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.840
And

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:43.760
what I remember was that we went down into&nbsp;
the kitchen and got like a grapefruit and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:54.320
they placed an X on a grapefruit and they had&nbsp;
me practice with a knife, like a stabbing.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.040
And I would say this is the most&nbsp;
traumatic thing that that happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:07.680
because it's the thing that&nbsp;
shattered my soul the most.

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:17.520
And this was when they had him lay down. They had

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:24.320
a knife and they wrapped my hands around the knife&nbsp;
and I actually couldn't do it. I was like, I can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:33.280
even penetrate this. And they were even talking&nbsp;
you have to penetrate the it's horrible to think,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:45.040
but you have to penetrate the like breast bone.&nbsp;
I I didn't even have that strength. So they,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:53.360
how I'm remembering it is that two of the&nbsp;
witches wrapped their hand around my hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:53.360 --> 00:34:03.200
and plunged the knife into this boy and I&nbsp;
and there was blood and I screamed and was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:13.600
so like so fractured, so dissociated,&nbsp;
screaming my head off and them saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:25.360
"Now you could be implicated. Now you could&nbsp;
go to jail for this if you tell anyone." And I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:36.000
remember just screaming and crying and saying,&nbsp;
"You made me do it. You made me do this." and

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:45.280
yeah, that was really soul shattering.&nbsp;
And it was a part of an entire day of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:56.960
being hazed into the cult where they&nbsp;
then did a ritual with they gave me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:05.200
how I'm remembering it is like a tab. I believe&nbsp;
it was a tab of LSD because I started to like trip&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:17.200
out and they we picked an area in my yard that&nbsp;
was already dug. It was like a mound that had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:29.760
it was sort of like a fresher construction site&nbsp;
and they had brought in a childsized coffin. And

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:37.840
because I was tripping, it's hard to&nbsp;
know whether these were real trained&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:45.280
snakes or not real. But they convinced&nbsp;
me that I was in a coffin with snakes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:52.560
and insects and not to move or the&nbsp;
snakes would bite. And they gave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:52.560 --> 00:36:03.440
me some kind of a a mask that to me I&nbsp;
affiliated with like a snorkel because,

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:09.440
you know, well I affiliate it now with a snorkel.&nbsp;
I used to go snorkeling in the Caribbean with my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:17.840
father and there was some kind of breathing device&nbsp;
where I was able to breathe but I was enclosed in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:27.680
something and it was in the dirt that was apparent&nbsp;
to me that there was a burying happening once they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:38.880
closed this and I was absolutely terrified. I&nbsp;
was afraid that if I moved even like an inch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:48.960
that something was going to bite me. I was most&nbsp;
afraid on an emotional level of that I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:56.000
never make it out and that my parents would&nbsp;
think that I ran away or was like kidnapped.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:56.640 --> 00:37:01.840
So that was the biggest fear I would say was that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:10.000
they'll just never know what happened&nbsp;
to me and the the heartbreak of that.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:22.560
And I would say that's when a lot of the LSD&nbsp;
was kicking in and I was really able to connect

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:35.440
on a deeper level spiritually and I heard&nbsp;
a very low but firm feminine voice which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:46.560
I'm recognizing as what people call Gia like&nbsp;
mother earth and or mother nature earth and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:57.840
she said even if you never make it out again&nbsp;
I'll take you I'll take care of you and that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:07.040
when I was able to just kind of like be in the&nbsp;
moment and I started to shift my body a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:21.200
and realized nothing was biting me and my&nbsp;
consciousness elevated in that moment. So

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:29.280
when the cult members pulled me out and I mean&nbsp;
there was like I remember dirt in my mouth like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:38.400
I remember they were brushing me off. I had&nbsp;
an actual vision of I guess I had seen Star&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:46.560
Wars at that age and so I think it's R2-D2&nbsp;
when he comes out of when he's in the desert.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:53.840
I got like a visual, you know, the mind will&nbsp;
always give you these like visual pictures. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:53.840 --> 00:39:00.640
and they had water for me and they said, "You&nbsp;
passed, you made it. you're in you're in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:09.120
in the group and I just remember thinking I&nbsp;
don't want to be in this group. Um and but at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:19.600
the same time I knew that these people were this&nbsp;
was like small potatoes like I had just elevated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:29.520
my consciousness in that experience above what&nbsp;
was happening truly. And I remember then I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:35.760
"What about what about Elijah?" And they&nbsp;
said, "It was all a show. It was all all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:45.440
smoke and mirrors." Um, the blood wasn't real.&nbsp;
It was pig's blood, which they use in movies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:55.680
They said all of these things which&nbsp;
could have also been a trick. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:02.720
I think these this is how these people operate&nbsp;
as well to just confuse you. Um so that you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:17.200
know what is real and what isn't. But after that&nbsp;
is when they married me to to to to the devil,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:31.440
to Satan, Lucifer, and they had us drink from&nbsp;
these metal goblets, and they had us do like a

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:39.440
it was like a mini aisle marriage. But to confuse&nbsp;
my memories, they had another child that had been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:45.920
there walk down the aisle with me. They had me&nbsp;
walk down with my stuffed an my favorite stuffed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:55.600
animal. And then they did the real like satanic&nbsp;
ritual marriage. And why they do that is so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:03.600
when your memories come up when you actually, you&nbsp;
know, start to really like unravel this stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:15.840
it's so confusing because they took a&nbsp;
memory and layered it three times. And

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:23.920
yeah, and that's a lot of work just um going into&nbsp;
therapy and starting to unravel these things and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:32.640
figuring fig figuring out what's real, what was&nbsp;
imaginary, what was a threat that was projected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:38.960
onto you that you envisioned in fear that's&nbsp;
not actually a memory of what happened. Those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:48.480
are things that, you know, I had to do a lot of&nbsp;
work in in many years of therapy to decipher.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:58.720
And yeah, thank you for sharing that&nbsp;
absolutely terrifying and horrific memory,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:03.360
you know, three memories with us. I know&nbsp;
that this stuff isn't easy to talk about.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:08.000
I know that this is kind of your first&nbsp;
time sharing it on a platform like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:15.760
um really very brave of you and very courageous.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, that's such a pain point with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:23.200
this healing is survivors who grew up in unsafe&nbsp;
environments like you reckoning with the fact that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:28.080
adults that should have been keeping them safe&nbsp;
and that they thought were keeping them safe in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:33.120
their front personalities, you know, growing&nbsp;
up um actually behind the scenes, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:38.480
perpetrating them and then also forcing these&nbsp;
children from such a young age to perpetrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:48.240
And that is such a pain point for survivors to&nbsp;
to heal from their guilt of of harming a a human,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:56.000
an animal, a child. Um but unfortunately that is&nbsp;
a massive part of the programming and it serves&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000
multiple levels in itself from keeping you loyal&nbsp;
because they they threaten you and say, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.040
things like how you said if if you don't&nbsp;
do this, we're going to harm this person.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:12.960
um we're going to harm the you know your family&nbsp;
or we're going to harm the person that uh we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:19.360
asking you to hurt worse than if you just do it.&nbsp;
And then on the other end they you know they give&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.880
you these different memories of actually having&nbsp;
the experience and then they gaslight you with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:30.880
No, it wasn't real. You know, there's all these&nbsp;
different levels of programming that create such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:39.760
a plethora of emotions of of anger, of confusion,&nbsp;
of sadness, of just deep, you know, conflict. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:45.520
it can create, you know, a lot of loyal parts,&nbsp;
too. Um, which obviously dissociation, which I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:50.320
grateful that you talked about because that's&nbsp;
obviously the the the means to an end of all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:56.000
this is dissociation and creating identities that&nbsp;
can, you know, hold these secrets in in different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.720
compartments. And, you know, when when they do&nbsp;
these horrific things, you know, they're confident&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:08.720
that you're not going to remember and that if you&nbsp;
do, it's going to be so confusing. And I mean just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:16.080
trying to comprehend, you know, being six years&nbsp;
old and being handed that decision, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:22.000
adults who were put in the same position if they&nbsp;
were randomly, you know, let's just say kidnapped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.880
or taken somewhere and somebody said, "Here's&nbsp;
your choice. You can hurt this person in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.680
way or we're going to hurt them this way and it's&nbsp;
going to be even worse. You might as well just do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.400
it." You know, I don't know a single adult that&nbsp;
that wouldn't just break and shatter. And so to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:43.680
think about these impossible choices that they&nbsp;
put on little children to make and then make them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:48.960
feel guilty. They threaten them. Like you said,&nbsp;
you're on drugs, so you're already, you know, sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:54.960
of seeing the world in in a very different way.&nbsp;
Um, you know, which which can be terrifying, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:00.560
um being on a a drug like LSD where it really&nbsp;
distorts your reality to begin with, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:07.200
and yes, I just it's amazing, you know, the work&nbsp;
that you and others have done to make sense of all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:12.720
of this because I'm sure even sharing it with a&nbsp;
therapist can be very vulnerable for many reasons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:18.000
especially not knowing if either a they'll&nbsp;
be traumatized and say, "I can't work with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.640
this or if they won't believe you, you know,&nbsp;
and and it takes such courage to actually talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.800
about this and I'm grateful that you did because&nbsp;
there's other survivors on the other side of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:31.840
screen. There's people even if they didn't&nbsp;
have something that extreme happen to them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:37.520
we all carry guilt in some way and we look at it&nbsp;
from one perspective that like I should have done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:44.080
something that's my fault, you know, and there's&nbsp;
a lot more to things that that happen because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:48.880
other people that make us carry guilt. And when&nbsp;
we can take that guilt and make sense of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:53.760
take the shame off our own shoulders and sort of&nbsp;
put it where it belongs, realize what what we did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:59.200
and were forced to do, but then also realize, like&nbsp;
you said, you had adults that had their hands over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:07.040
yours. They had you practice. Like there was a lot&nbsp;
that went into eventually forcing you to do this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.480
you know, and being able to take that shame and&nbsp;
say, "Okay, this was real. I did experience this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.760
It is horrible and I'm going to heal from this.&nbsp;
You know, I'm going to go through it and I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:22.320
going to make sense of it and face it and heal&nbsp;
it, but I'm not going to carry the shame. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:26.560
going to put it where it belongs on them and I'm&nbsp;
going to realize that I was a a child. I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:31.280
have a choice and it was an impossible choice.&nbsp;
If you would have said no or if you would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:36.880
somehow like completely, you know, defied it,&nbsp;
they still would have made you do it. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.800
they would have they would have restrained&nbsp;
you and made you do it or they would have,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:46.880
you know, made you watch a worse scenario that&nbsp;
they did to scare you, you know. Yes. Same. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:51.920
it's it's literally like a catch 22, like&nbsp;
no matter what you do, you know, and so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:56.160
and they're right, you know, a lot of times the&nbsp;
situation is worse if the child doesn't comply.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.840
And they do that for a reason, too. They want you&nbsp;
to be like, "All right, I'm just going to do this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:05.200
because I know what you're going to do is going&nbsp;
to be worse." you know, and so that also creates a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:08.800
compliance in the child where it just breaks them&nbsp;
down and they're like, there's no point in saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:14.960
no because it's going to happen anyways. And you&nbsp;
know, there's there's just so many different like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:20.640
layers and programming layers of programming that&nbsp;
they put into this. And so I deeply appreciate you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:26.000
sharing cuz like I said, it's a it's a really&nbsp;
really big struggle point in this community. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.160
can be really hard to make sense of. But the more&nbsp;
that we talk about these things, then we realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:38.560
that we can take that shame gently off and put it&nbsp;
where it belongs and then do the healing for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:44.240
reckoning of what actually happened, you know,&nbsp;
of being forced into an impossible situation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.960
you know, and realizing that it wasn't your fault,&nbsp;
but that it still was horrible. It still happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:52.640
and that there healing that needs done, you&nbsp;
know. So, thank you from the bottom of my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:52.640 --> 00:48:00.640
heart for talking about these really hard things.&nbsp;
Yes. Oh, thank you. Yes. And I want to say that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:12.800
I mean obviously why they use children is because&nbsp;
children are pure and innocent and the closest to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:26.160
God. And these people who are beings of hatred and&nbsp;
darkness like the lowest of the low consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:44.000
They they get off on corrupting someone that is&nbsp;
closest to God. And I have thought a lot about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.720
what was their purpose, what were they really&nbsp;
getting from this other than, you know, I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:55.200
I watched adults take vows that they were&nbsp;
going to get certain things from the devil.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:04.640
Um they were promised things by the the the&nbsp;
leader of the coven you know different things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:11.040
one woman who couldn't get pregnant, wanted to&nbsp;
be, you know, wanted to have another baby and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:26.080
just wealth and, you know, but on this other level&nbsp;
of like, have you heard about redemption through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:37.920
sin? Have you heard about that? I find that&nbsp;
to be really interesting when you look at it

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:48.080
from a higher perspective of, you know,&nbsp;
these beings that are clearly suffering so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:58.400
much that they would do these horrific&nbsp;
acts. Um they're some a lot of them I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:08.640
believe are trying to redeem themselves&nbsp;
through it's called redemption through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:18.000
sin. They think that if they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up&nbsp;
so bad that somehow like God will have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:26.960
mercy on their soul. It really doesn't&nbsp;
even make sense. But they're serving

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:36.320
on a level of um like duality. They're they're&nbsp;
serving the darkest of the dark. And in a way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:47.200
they are cat they're catalysts. But it's&nbsp;
it's like thinking that if you mess up so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:56.160
badly like to your parents like maybe they'll&nbsp;
take pity on you and like take you back. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:05.840
these people are so rejected or have rejected&nbsp;
life so much that they're that they cannot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:16.640
source their own power from original source&nbsp;
light creator you know holy mother creator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:29.120
um the source of all that is they are they have to&nbsp;
take it from other people that's what they think.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:34.400
Um, I don't know if that fully makes sense, but&nbsp;
it's just something that that comes to me like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:42.400
sometimes when I think about like what what is&nbsp;
the purpose of that? And and obviously a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:51.120
it there's nuances, but you know there's levels of&nbsp;
power also. Some of them are just enjoying getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:51.120 --> 00:52:00.880
power over others. Some of them are, you know,&nbsp;
really deep into occultism and they're gaining,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:08.400
you know, power on the on the dark side. They're&nbsp;
like they're working in the dark side and they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:20.480
they're they're gaining power that way, which is&nbsp;
not real power because with all of this that has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:31.280
happened to me. I mean, I actually have always had&nbsp;
an angelic counsel connection. And I've I've seen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:44.640
so much of the sort of the realms of existence&nbsp;
and and of humanity and the angelic realms. And

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:53.760
when you know to go on the dark side of&nbsp;
everything, it only goes to a certain level.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:53.760 --> 00:53:06.400
like it it the the light is so much higher. Um&nbsp;
you it's like um there's a ceiling of pretty low&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:12.560
ceiling of consciousness is what I'm saying.&nbsp;
Even if you graduate to a seemingly very high&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:24.640
level in these like you know occult practices&nbsp;
that are that are sourced from darkness. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:30.800
you're so that's a really great analogy for that&nbsp;
cuz it's it's again an impossible thing for people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:38.400
to contend with which also makes people gaslight&nbsp;
their own ability to believe in this stuff because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:43.200
it's so backwards from how somebody who's not&nbsp;
a psychopath is. You know, unless you're a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:49.280
psychopath, unless you're a Satan worshipper and&nbsp;
somebody that is just they live for that power,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:55.040
or so they're trained to live for that power and&nbsp;
conditioned and mind controlled to, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:55.040 --> 00:54:01.040
it can just seem so bizarre that there's people&nbsp;
out there that are committing these crimes and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:06.960
then going to work the next day and they're just&nbsp;
out there in society. And so I do get how people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:14.160
can just not be able to sit with it because it&nbsp;
doesn't make sense. But at the same time, when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:20.800
we're looking at this, we do have to put on an&nbsp;
impossible lens to look through of understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:28.560
psychopathy, of understanding narcissism, of&nbsp;
understanding the complete and total domination of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:36.800
of your mind given up to, you know, other people.&nbsp;
And then also to being so hungry for power and to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:43.040
having that be something that you're trained to&nbsp;
just continue wanting and to do it all at all cost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:48.240
no matter what it is that you will do whatever&nbsp;
it takes to get that power you know and then all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:53.680
the different layers under it the blackmailing&nbsp;
that they do and you know dissociating you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:59.040
I mean there's just so many different layers to&nbsp;
it and I also appreciate too that you brought up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:05.120
why they use children you know and and you have&nbsp;
some examples of this in your story where they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:11.840
know that children, especially children that they&nbsp;
specifically breed or target that have different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:15.680
qualities that they're interested in, such as&nbsp;
like how you said your bloodline has sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:20.320
heightened psychic abilities that run through&nbsp;
it. And that's a big fascination for them for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:26.480
many reasons. But when we're looking at, you&nbsp;
know, a ritualistic perspective, without their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:32.000
soul sort of being intact, without them having a&nbsp;
connection, like you said, to the divine light,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:37.520
when they're shut off to that because they're&nbsp;
vibrating on an opposite frequency, they can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:43.280
connect to these beings that they want power from.&nbsp;
And they have to use, like you said, a child, some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:49.680
something that is connected to it in order to have&nbsp;
like that conduit. And so a lot of these children,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:56.160
they're grooming to to further enhance their&nbsp;
psychic abilities, which your story exemplifies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:03.120
um you know, with with some of the things that&nbsp;
you were recognized for. Um but you really see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:09.680
you know, how these dynamics make sense&nbsp;
to these people because of who they are,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:15.600
which is different and pretty much opposite of&nbsp;
how, you know, a person in normal society is. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:20.720
that does make total sense what you're saying,&nbsp;
you know, and maybe we could talk a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:26.480
about that since we're sort of talking about the&nbsp;
the satanic side, you know, a little bit about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:32.400
some of the ways that you were recognized and&nbsp;
used for your own spiritual gifts that you have,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:37.760
you know, which is kind of another sad point in&nbsp;
this cuz a lot of you are born with these really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:43.920
extraordinary spiritual gifts, you know, and&nbsp;
luckily a lot of you now that get out are using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:49.680
them the ways that God intended you to. But of&nbsp;
course, these people, these psychopaths, they want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:57.680
to harness that for their own agendas and and use&nbsp;
you as a conduit to use those gifts to help them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:03.360
you know, achieve power or to do evil or, you&nbsp;
know, to help them with these very dark agendas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:08.000
So, maybe you could touch on that a little bit&nbsp;
with your story um and help bring some sense to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:13.200
it. Um but also sort of share because it this is&nbsp;
kind of a big part too, the spiritual side of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:27.600
Yeah, it really is. Um, well, I mean, as far back&nbsp;
as I can remember, I was sensitive to spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:33.360
The first house we lived in was haunted. I&nbsp;
remember watching spirits fly around me and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:41.280
when I was in the crib, you know, I was a seer&nbsp;
always. and especially as a child which I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:51.360
see the spirits now but I I can more feel them&nbsp;
and with um my connection with with Jesus with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:59.920
Yeshua and I can channel and and if I want&nbsp;
to speak to other spirits I don't tend to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:09.040
I tend to stick with my original counsel which is&nbsp;
angelic counsel and Yeshua um for safety reasons,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:20.480
you know, but I always had that ability to to&nbsp;
see the unseen world and to fly out of my body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:28.400
which that would be up to up for debate whether&nbsp;
I was taught to fly through the remote viewing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:41.760
uh programming that I received through&nbsp;
Project Stargate. Um but yeah, I mean I I

00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:50.080
I was born on a date that has some heightened&nbsp;
it has some celebrity names around it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:50.080 --> 00:59:04.160
uh even like one um yogic master uh is was born on&nbsp;
that date. But my father was friends with this ma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:15.120
man named Howard and he worked with Ingo Swan&nbsp;
who was head of the remote viewing department&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:27.760
for the CIA remote viewing Ingo Swan and who&nbsp;
also worked with um Russell Tar and Harold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:36.880
Hal Pudof is his name. And so those are people&nbsp;
that I've met. When I look at photos of them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:44.880
I I it's very familiar that I've worked with them.&nbsp;
I remember working with them and I remember being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:59.680
trained by them. And you know they they would you&nbsp;
know the what's explained to you as a child you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:07.840
know as um as an incentive to want to cooperate&nbsp;
in certain ways even though they're going to force&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:14.720
you to cooperate anyway. But like on the higher&nbsp;
levels of that, you're told as a child like you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:22.720
helping our government, you know, do things, get,&nbsp;
you know, get rid of the bad people. It's like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:38.160
the you're helping be the hero. Um that's the&nbsp;
programming with it. And so even when I wasn't

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.800
and possibly even before I went&nbsp;
to a safe house and that's hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:51.520
to kind of chronologically like&nbsp;
put on a timeline, but I remember

01:00:51.520 --> 01:01:00.000
um Howard would and these men that had a hand in&nbsp;
my programming would talk to me about having a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:08.400
visual before going to sleep and then setting a&nbsp;
target. And the visual would would be something&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:17.920
that would help me to fly out of my body and then&nbsp;
a landing spot to make sure that I could get back&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:25.600
into my body. And so, you know, as a child, you&nbsp;
pick something like a hot air balloon or a kite&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:35.680
or an airplane. And I would choose the landing of&nbsp;
my friend's bottom of his staircase. He just had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:46.960
very cool house. And so, I picked the bottom of&nbsp;
his stairs to land. And that's how I would give&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:55.200
myself that focus of going back into my body&nbsp;
after I would go out into essentially out into&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:04.560
the ethers into the stars. And when they would&nbsp;
pick a a practice target, you would your spirit&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:15.040
essentially your consciousness is is viewing&nbsp;
something from above um a and dropping in. So you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:28.960
you could be witnessing a conversation, you could&nbsp;
be seeing um a building. It's um the way something&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:37.760
is physically set up, a note, a conversation being&nbsp;
had. But a lot of it obviously with a child was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:51.760
practice before you're likely doing the really&nbsp;
serious uh like heavy heavy hitter heavy hitter&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:51.760 --> 01:03:00.640
work. But did that answer your question? Is that&nbsp;
going in the That's absolutely yes. And and thank&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.440
you for too for bringing up Stargate because&nbsp;
the remote viewing part is very common with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:12.880
MK Ultra circles as well and a gift that a lot of&nbsp;
these children um seem to naturally have which to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.960
my understanding something like remote viewing&nbsp;
and and all spiritual gifts. I think we all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.360
no matter who you are, you have you can tap&nbsp;
into them. But, you know, they they recognize&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:28.080
that some of these children have the ability to&nbsp;
do it better or more naturally. And so then they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:34.400
they continue to refine the child in it. Just&nbsp;
like how another child might go to, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:39.840
soccer practice every day. with you. Instead of&nbsp;
going to a soccer practice, they're training you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:45.600
on this and and you know, um, having you practice&nbsp;
it and refine it for them to be able to use later&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:50.080
on in your life whenever you're, you know, of&nbsp;
course they're using it then, but they, like you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.120
said, they're training you whenever you're young&nbsp;
to use you in a more serious manner as you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:55.120 --> 01:04:09.920
better at it through time. Yes. Yes. Exactly.&nbsp;
And and there's, you know, with that obviously

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:17.440
especially when you're in their in their&nbsp;
direct care in like a safe house where&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:26.160
the training is going really strong,&nbsp;
there is so much pressure and torture&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:35.360
um being which it which honestly I I mean, it's&nbsp;
not necessary to do that. If you think about a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:47.280
child and how open a child is and and especially&nbsp;
like a good naturatured a a a goodnatured child um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:58.400
like we listened. We didn't need to be, you know,&nbsp;
electroshocked to participate in the exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:10.400
That's the part to me that is just baffling. But&nbsp;
it's obviously a big part of that is to make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:25.120
child forget and to dissociate into specific&nbsp;
fragments of personalities. And you know

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:37.120
the the first memory that I have of being&nbsp;
taken to a safe house, I actually remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:45.680
my family being threatened and there were two&nbsp;
men there and I don't know if they had a gun&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:58.400
or said they had a gun, But I was essentially I&nbsp;
remember my mother begging them not to take me&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:07.440
and them giving her the choice of either we&nbsp;
will take out your whole family or you will&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:19.840
allow us access to your child. we won't hurt a&nbsp;
hair on her head and we'll bring her back. And

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:30.160
I was literally put in I was picked up with&nbsp;
my legs dangling over this man's arms. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:38.800
remember what he was wearing, like part of it at&nbsp;
least. Um it was like a yellow like peak kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:48.560
um collared shirt like cotton shirt and a members&nbsp;
only jacket. Um that used to trigger me when I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:48.560 --> 01:07:01.840
would see that. Um, and and I was brought into&nbsp;
this, how I remember it, as like an openseated

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:06.560
black Cadillac with tinted&nbsp;
windows and leather seats,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:14.800
open seating. And I just was put in the in the&nbsp;
car. And I remember like crawling around the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:21.600
back and looking up. I'd never seen windows&nbsp;
like that before. and one of the men saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:30.400
"See, you can see out, but no one can see&nbsp;
in." And we went on a very long drive,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:40.080
which I've kind of tracked it. It may have been&nbsp;
a safe house in Pittsburgh. I'm not sure of all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:50.560
my locations. Um, and I don't know how many&nbsp;
times I was brought into a safe house, but

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:54.960
I

01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:04.320
was brought into a facility where there were other&nbsp;
children like me and around my age and put into&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:11.520
these exercise training rooms. And I remember like&nbsp;
one of the one of the things that really stands&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:20.320
out to me was a boy that they put me in front of&nbsp;
and there was a um a female I guess I would call&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:32.160
her like a psychologist or she was a trainer&nbsp;
but it felt like she was like a therapist. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:43.600
and she had like a gentle nature to her and she&nbsp;
had me hold palm to palm with this boy and said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:55.520
"Now, no speaking. Let him show you his most&nbsp;
impactful experience." And somehow I guess he&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:05.840
would tell something to her and she would have&nbsp;
note of what he was projecting to me. And I saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:14.160
that this boy had had a single mother, that she&nbsp;
would make him mac and cheese and chocolate milk.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:21.280
And I saw the carpeting in the house and that he&nbsp;
used to have long hair. And that in this program&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:28.800
he was brought into that his head had been&nbsp;
shaved. And I remember just and he was really&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:35.120
sad that all his hair was gone and he missed&nbsp;
his mother. And I remember like just saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:41.760
"You still look nice." And she was like, "Yes,&nbsp;
you can tell him that he looks nice." And so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:51.520
there were like there were moments where there was&nbsp;
emotional encouragement and then utter emotional&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:59.120
torture. You know, build a safe place in your&nbsp;
mind and draw it out. And I would draw these like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:07.200
heaven landscapes with a Pegasus and then that&nbsp;
therapist would leave and a man would come in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:15.920
say there is no safe place. and I would be like&nbsp;
tortured. So, it was a lot of things like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:25.680
Um, there's one scenario where I was put&nbsp;
into a mint green padded room and I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:38.320
padded floor to ceiling and I was starved and I&nbsp;
don't know for how long but I was so hungry and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:46.000
I was aware that I was being watched from like an&nbsp;
observational deck of sorts and there was also Alo&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:53.280
one of those doors where it's a split door where&nbsp;
someone can open to talk to you and some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:53.280 --> 01:11:02.400
guards would sometimes like peek in and tease me&nbsp;
and eat a pizza like in front of me and I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:10.640
be begging to eat something. And at one point it&nbsp;
was explained to me by one of the facilitators,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:20.320
we can't feed you. You need to be a&nbsp;
clear channel for the session. Um, and

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:27.760
I and they were watching me. I remember loud&nbsp;
noises being played and I was throwing myself up&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:43.360
against this padded wall and just like collapsing&nbsp;
in utter just despair, frustration. Like I I I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:50.960
remember some kind again. I could be mixing&nbsp;
memories with that one padded room incident, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:50.960 --> 01:12:00.880
for some reason my memories also show me a water&nbsp;
boarding experience where I was like where my head&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:10.640
just kept being like pushed into water as like a&nbsp;
tor a form of torture. And at that those points,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:19.360
um, I feel like at high torture points, I really&nbsp;
did connect with what I would what I would call&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:30.320
God, like holy holy father energy. Like at one&nbsp;
point I I saw him going through it with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:43.200
Um, so you know, and I had a lot of those angelic&nbsp;
intervention moments. I have I I had a near-death&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:51.840
during either that experience or at the safe house&nbsp;
in that experience because they were doing so much&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:51.840 --> 01:13:02.480
um electroshock and things that were bringing&nbsp;
me to near death. Um, and so I did have one&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:07.920
experience where, and it I probably have&nbsp;
more than this that I'm not even remembering,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:20.000
but the one that I really remember is um waking&nbsp;
up on like heaven's floor essentially. And there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:35.360
were angelic beings standing over me and and I&nbsp;
just said I don't want to go back there. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:43.840
some like mystical things there where um like&nbsp;
a pogo stick in heaven goes a lot higher than&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:52.640
one on regular 3D earth. Um, I mean they they let&nbsp;
me play like I was like riding the horses and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:52.640 --> 01:14:00.160
Pegasus and you know there's like that stuff is&nbsp;
those are creatures of heaven and I was then taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:10.080
to I believe there's different realms of heaven&nbsp;
according to consciousness but um I was brought by&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:23.360
these two angels to a gate where there was a being&nbsp;
there and I was afraid to even like speak but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:34.480
was saying let her speak and I said I don't want&nbsp;
to go back and the answer I got was the choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:45.040
is ultimately up to you but you would be missed&nbsp;
back there there are many people who would miss&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:55.440
you and there's a calling for you to fulfill like&nbsp;
you wouldn't finish that. Um, and I just remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:01.840
making that, you know, I was I've always been&nbsp;
like one of those reluctant empaths like like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:08.240
uh I guess I have to go back kind of like you&nbsp;
know, you know, you have to do the right thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:21.200
And I was told to um by this being at these like&nbsp;
I I saw the pearly gates, you know, I was told&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:33.680
show her around and then bring her back and the&nbsp;
angels flew me into different realms. Um like

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:40.160
what do you call them? I don't I'm for&nbsp;
some reason at a loss for the word,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:49.200
but almost different etheric dimensions kind&nbsp;
of. And then I was shown what I would call the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:58.640
realm of hell and I was flown through it and I&nbsp;
actually got scared and they said, "Don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:08.560
like you're not condemned here." like they&nbsp;
were showing me everything. And I saw this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:19.440
it was like a circus, like a the darkest circus&nbsp;
you could ever see. I saw all of these beings

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.120
on so many levels just suffering and but there was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:33.200
like fire throwing and I mean&nbsp;
it was like a really bad um

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:41.360
what are they what is that festival called that&nbsp;
like it was bizarre like a Burning Man type. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:55.120
you. like a like a bad version of Burning Man.&nbsp;
Like it was it was suffering souls and it was like

01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:02.640
everyone going through their own level of&nbsp;
torment. It was condemned souls and it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:11.040
also bizarre like I said like for the lost&nbsp;
fire throwing and like just like a bizarre&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:23.840
like a like weird like a David Lynch movie kind&nbsp;
of stuff. Um, and yeah, I got scared and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:34.320
they flew me out of there, but it was like a tour&nbsp;
a tour of hell. And I believe it this this whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:40.160
experience ended on a better note though, one of&nbsp;
the higher realms. And then I just like was zipped&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:50.800
back into my body. And I remember having like a&nbsp;
renewed hope. It was an instantaneous renewed hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:50.800 --> 01:18:01.600
because obviously being tortured like that in a&nbsp;
body that you can't get out of creates a a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:11.840
visceral sense of hopelessness. So, but for some&nbsp;
reason that whole experience gave me a new level&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:19.760
of hope and I remember saying I I can do this.&nbsp;
That's so profound. And it's so interesting too&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:25.920
to hear like how spiritual you were from such&nbsp;
a young age that you have these like really&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:30.880
horrific things that are happening to you and&nbsp;
your body's undergoing the most extreme stress,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:36.080
torture and trauma that a human could possibly be&nbsp;
in right to the point like you said of pushing you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:42.240
to death or beyond you know and here you are able&nbsp;
to tap whether it was through the LSD like how&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:48.720
you were talking about um or just through your&nbsp;
own consciousness. Yes. being able to like get&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:53.360
yourself through what you were going through&nbsp;
through leaving that moment and being able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:59.440
climb sort of above where your consciousness was&nbsp;
in that moment. It's really interesting hearing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:04.960
stories from you and others like that.&nbsp;
You know, I feel like it's one thing to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:10.240
you know, have one of those experiences where, you&nbsp;
know, somebody say drowns. You know, you hear of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:14.480
these stories sometimes where there's people that&nbsp;
they do die for a moment and then they come back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:19.040
you know, or cardiac arrest. um people that have&nbsp;
written about, you know, what's on the other side.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:24.320
But I also think that there's, you know, profound&nbsp;
experiences that aren't talked about enough like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:30.160
on the brink of that, you know, before that&nbsp;
actually happens, if it even does happen. Those&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:37.040
moments going towards, you know, death or beyond,&nbsp;
right before that, there's these really profound&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:42.560
moments that people have with being able to, you&nbsp;
know, sort of connect with something greater than&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:49.520
them in order to hold on. And then how you, you&nbsp;
know, your your body on in this physical plane&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:54.960
that you and I are speaking in right now is being&nbsp;
tortured to death. And here you are, you know, up&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:54.960 --> 01:20:00.400
in these heavenly realms making a decision to go&nbsp;
back into your body. You know, that like brought&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:05.440
me to tears hearing you say that, you know, a&nbsp;
child again making these impossible decisions&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.160
when you could have just been like, "No, you know&nbsp;
what? I've I didn't this is not the empathy that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:16.640
I signed up for. Like, I'm done." that you you&nbsp;
have like no safety around you in the moment that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:21.520
you have to go back in and you're still saying&nbsp;
people will miss me. I have an impact to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:27.840
I'm going to go back and do it despite what I'm&nbsp;
what I'm going back into. You know, just very&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:38.640
very profound. Yes. Yes. Yeah. because we don't.&nbsp;
So I I just want to say like once the once the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:46.560
body and the ego are involved in this like because&nbsp;
we are infinite beings our souls like we're good&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:56.800
we're covered like I truly believe that like if&nbsp;
you lead a good life you have a good spirit um

01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:05.840
you know we are divinely protected but when&nbsp;
you are being subjected to such levels of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:21.200
darkness and torture. Like it's very hard for&nbsp;
the ego identity and body to to deal with that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:29.200
It's like and I've had to do because and I don't&nbsp;
necessarily promote doing a lot of shadow work but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:40.560
in my healing I've had to acknowledge that my ego&nbsp;
was really prepped to be thick at a certain point&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:52.480
because of what I went through that I just on&nbsp;
that level felt like I needed these these other&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:52.480 --> 01:22:03.840
ways to protect myself. So my ego almost like it's&nbsp;
like when you have too much coverage or protection&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:12.480
it starts to hurt. Like that's what happened to&nbsp;
me. um where I and I've had to really strip those&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:21.040
layers to like bring me back into becoming an&nbsp;
open vessel, being an open heart, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:30.240
connecting again to others like because that stuff&nbsp;
really closes you down. It's very challenging to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:40.960
this physical experience. Yes, 100%. I couldn't&nbsp;
agree more. And one thing uh before I forget&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:45.280
that I wanted to ask you about some of the&nbsp;
memories that you were just talking about. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:52.640
when you say safe house, is that like a literal&nbsp;
safe house or is this sort of a a private for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:59.120
better luck of words like programming center&nbsp;
that is just utilized for children like you?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:07.200
So, I call it a safe house just because that's&nbsp;
was a term that someone said to me when I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:11.760
processing a lot of these memories&nbsp;
like that they're called safe houses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:19.280
but and to me the safety is just for them to&nbsp;
protect themselves like the perpetrators. Uh yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:27.840
I mean it's government and I mean I don't I don't&nbsp;
know like is it government and private? like it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:38.160
for sure only highlevel access to these buildings.&nbsp;
Um, yeah, they're facility. I mean, it was my word&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:52.400
I was using for like a CIA facility and and like I&nbsp;
was saying, I I was telling you before this about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:59.920
you know, likely a lot of your listeners&nbsp;
know that the CIA all a lot of those files&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:08.880
are out through the Freedom of Information Act,&nbsp;
these MK Ultra files. And I found one of mine&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:16.400
uh at least in a grouping where, you know,&nbsp;
it talks about in 1984 25 psychic children&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:24.640
were used in Project Stargate, you know, psychic&nbsp;
testing um on these children. And I'm like, "Yep,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:30.720
that was me. I'm one of them." I wish I could&nbsp;
find some of the others, you know? I wish I could&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:43.040
really talk to some of the people I was down there&nbsp;
with. Those memories are spotty as far as who I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:57.280
was around. It's it's you know I would say most of&nbsp;
what I remember are the direct programming torture&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:07.600
sess you know sessions that were done and I think&nbsp;
we were kept quite isolated for a lot of the time

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:15.360
and now also to go along with that Stargate is&nbsp;
obviously sort of an extension of gifted and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:20.400
talented programs sort of in the same realm. Kind&nbsp;
of a government scouting program. One is a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:25.440
bit more severe than the other. A lot of times um&nbsp;
there's different layers of gifted and talented as&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:31.120
well, but you were actually put in those programs&nbsp;
as well in school. Um could you remember about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:37.760
that and um were you taken off property or what&nbsp;
was the gifted and talented program like for you?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:50.880
So not I don't not a lot like as far as like&nbsp;
so yes I was in gifted and talented up until&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:56.800
a certain point and then I feel I was taken out&nbsp;
of it. I actually at a certain point from all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:04.880
this abuse like I developed learning issues,&nbsp;
disabilities um because I was dissociating so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:12.800
badly, I would just my I would be reading in&nbsp;
a group and my brain would dissociate. I could&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:24.080
sometimes not even read the words. Um, and but&nbsp;
yes, when so I changed schools three times before&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:29.280
the age of eight and that's not counting the&nbsp;
little bit of schooling I did in the Caribbean.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:34.960
That would be the school number four that I'm&nbsp;
just like that was more just woven in and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:41.120
was a very small group of kids and it was right on&nbsp;
the beach and that was only like when my parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:52.800
wanted their vacation for a month or two at a time&nbsp;
and but first I was in a public school so kinder I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:58.960
think was one of the programs that was connected&nbsp;
I don't know if you've looked into kinder&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:05.040
And there's a lot of like known MK Ultra connected&nbsp;
to that. That would have been like nursery school,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:13.680
kindergarten that was public. And then and&nbsp;
like like a preschool. Then I was put I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:20.000
in a public school where a lot of testing went&nbsp;
on and I was in that like G&amp;T kind of thing. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:28.160
I just remember really uncomfortable, strange&nbsp;
testing going on and a lot of hearing tests up&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:35.760
until I was nine. They would pull me out for those&nbsp;
weird hearing tests with the beeping that are like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:43.280
so who knows what that fully was cuz I don't&nbsp;
think it was just about testing your hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:53.200
Um but to me that's the least traumatizing of&nbsp;
most of the things that happened. Um but but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:53.200 --> 01:28:01.200
reinforcing you know um just in general public&nbsp;
schools and I won't go too much off of off on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:09.440
tangent but I believe all of us even the non like&nbsp;
mainstream MK Ultra survivors like we were all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:19.840
traumatized by public schools municipal buildings&nbsp;
with asbestous um like cleansing products that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:30.400
are just chemical and artificial like and just&nbsp;
really unsaavory, you know, teaching tactics,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:41.040
insensitivity. Um but so yes at one school which&nbsp;
was a school called Spring School which was public&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:50.000
and that was my technically my kindergarten and my&nbsp;
first grade. There was a lot of these weird tests,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:50.000 --> 01:29:04.640
a lot of like testing my um like a lot of puzzles,&nbsp;
a lot of like just oddly designed tests that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:15.440
would be alone with one other facilitator doing&nbsp;
these things to be placed. And then I spent 2&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:22.080
years in a private school that I believe once&nbsp;
I was really like in the program, once that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:32.800
underway, they were paying for this. And there&nbsp;
was a lot of talk about just my direction. Like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:38.000
it wasn't just teachers and my mom, you know,&nbsp;
talking about, oh, she needs to learn more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:47.680
science. It was like two men that were had a hand&nbsp;
in my education and the direction of it and would&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:55.280
pull me out during this private school which was&nbsp;
actually at a school school called Hampton Day&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:03.360
School and we would go into the gymnasium which&nbsp;
you know when it was not being used and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:12.400
would do programming there and that's when there&nbsp;
were also some Mason what I believe were Freemason&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:23.920
um programming things going on as well. Like I&nbsp;
just remember being told like do you want to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:30.320
a brick in the house? Do you like prepare yourself&nbsp;
to be built like a brick in the house? like they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:39.760
I was hazed into multiple like I remember talk&nbsp;
of my main perpetrator him trying to convince my&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:50.400
father that I would be that I should be a part of&nbsp;
a rainbow girls program which is a Mason program.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:56.560
I think it's also connected to like the brownies&nbsp;
and girl scouts and stuff. It's all that like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:05.600
extracurricular like let us guide your child to&nbsp;
be a better citizen but it's programming. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:13.440
so I don't know if that answers your question.&nbsp;
And also I don't have so many like G&amp;T memories,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:22.160
but I know that that's a part of it. And I had&nbsp;
and I remember when I wasn't in it anymore. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:28.320
my one of my best friends like bragging that's&nbsp;
why I'm in gifted and talented like you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:37.440
like Yeah. It's interesting how these stories&nbsp;
overlap so much and how many children who were&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:44.000
in MK Ultra or related program Stargate were&nbsp;
also coinciding with having this additional&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.960
testing done in their regular day schools that&nbsp;
they were going to on different levels. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:55.600
there were some stories I've heard where the&nbsp;
the testing went into MK Ultra type experiments&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:55.600 --> 01:32:01.120
actually in the school program where other people&nbsp;
had more experiences like you where those programs&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:05.520
were maybe at a different facility where they&nbsp;
would do the Stargate type remote viewing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:11.280
then school was, you know, the the typical gate&nbsp;
stuff, the headphones and the weird the weird&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:15.920
uh scenarios that they'd have children&nbsp;
figure out and and just like the the bizarre&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:22.720
um kind of uh strategy games and things like that&nbsp;
that they kids do. But it it's a commonality in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:28.640
this community that you know a lot of you for one&nbsp;
have and were tested for high IQs and that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:33.760
were put in those programs in one way or another.&nbsp;
You know no matter what level it was a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:39.280
you you know were recognized even in school for&nbsp;
having uh you know the high IQ and the propensity&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:43.760
to you know maybe have psychic abilities and these&nbsp;
different things that they were testing for there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:56.160
too. Yes. Yeah. And so what other locations&nbsp;
were you taken to um for these experiments,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:56.160 --> 01:33:02.400
for these, you know, abuses? Um I know Montalk&nbsp;
is is near you. There's, you know, New York is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:07.360
it's kind of a hot spot whenever you there's not&nbsp;
a ton of survivors out there talking about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:11.120
but it has been coming up more and more and&nbsp;
and you realize that there is actually a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:15.840
to the state. So I'd be curious what else&nbsp;
you could tell us about where you were at.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:23.920
Okay. So, so where I'm from is just&nbsp;
about 25 minutes from Montalk. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:35.600
I do believe that I was at the base. I am not sure&nbsp;
how often, but I believe I was brought there. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:46.400
I wish I had more locations to to give because a&nbsp;
lot of my programming also feels as if it were in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:56.800
my bedroom, in my own bedroom, which there was one&nbsp;
deprogrammer I worked with in my healing journey&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:56.800 --> 01:34:04.960
who said that if these people were invested&nbsp;
enough in me, in programming me, They could&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:14.720
have recreated my bedroom in a safe house or in&nbsp;
a facility. So that you know what I'm saying as&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:25.280
but also it is very possible because I of what the&nbsp;
things my parents knew about and like I said when&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:36.000
I say they knew I mean parts of them were sub knew&nbsp;
about this um they I could have been programmed in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:55.200
in my bedroom um a lot And but as far as montalk&nbsp;
goes, I really only have one memory of likely&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:55.200 --> 01:35:09.520
being there and that is there was so there's there&nbsp;
are two men that have written a book the montalk&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:19.440
Project Chronicles and I believe that I've met&nbsp;
Preston Nicholls who's now deceased and they wrote&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:25.760
all these things about what went on in in Montalk&nbsp;
and were connected to this project Philadelphia&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:36.960
and Ma project you know this is like Camp Hero is&nbsp;
the is the military base location and what I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:49.360
remember is holding ing his hand and walking&nbsp;
through this sliding. It looked like a photo&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:55.280
booth. How how when you go in not a photo like&nbsp;
a if you're like developing film that's a photo&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:55.280 --> 01:36:02.160
booth, right? No, that's not a photo booth. It's&nbsp;
like a um sorry like a a dark room a a photography&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:09.920
dark room. It looked like something like that&nbsp;
where you're walking through one of these doors&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:18.320
that that you have to like rotate and it's just&nbsp;
yeah completely dark. And I just remember walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:28.800
through with him and me asking essentially I&nbsp;
believe that we did a time travel because I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:28.800 --> 01:36:38.560
remember saying like what day is it? What time&nbsp;
is it? And he's like we'll get we'll get us back&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:44.560
to the current time. Like where we're going it&nbsp;
doesn't matter. and it was like we walked through&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:54.800
something and that's all I really remember about&nbsp;
that. It is possible that one of the locations in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:05.040
fact that I was in the programming, you know, I'm&nbsp;
I really thought um like I said, Pittsburgh and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:13.520
that was sort of off of an intuition of someone&nbsp;
else who w is a deprogrammer, a friend of mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:14.080 --> 01:37:23.360
Um I I know that we like had driven a long&nbsp;
distance but it is possible that I was programmed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:35.280
there as well in Montalk a lot. And one other&nbsp;
thing that I did see in one of these facilities is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:47.280
what I call a government created alien. And it was&nbsp;
like a robot that was made to look like an alien,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:55.040
like a mechanical alien. And they were all&nbsp;
over. I don't know how else to to to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:10.240
it. It's like a standard like gray alien, but it&nbsp;
was like wheeling on the floor like a robot. And

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:18.880
I just remember like trying to talk to one of&nbsp;
like it once and one of the facilitators coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:26.560
in and yelling at it to leave and I felt I felt&nbsp;
sorry for it. I mean that's how sensitive I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:38.720
as well. Like whether it was a real being or not I&nbsp;
I believe it was mechanical. And I've heard other

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:47.120
um I've at least heard one one or so other&nbsp;
testimonies where where someone has mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:59.200
like the government created aliens type of you&nbsp;
know for whatever purpose that is. I don't know.

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:03.040
Do you remember? Um, I know that&nbsp;
it doesn't seem like that it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:06.480
something that you witnessed and were sort&nbsp;
of walking by. It wasn't something you were&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:13.200
involved in. Did you see them doing anything&nbsp;
or anything that any uses that you could see&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:20.160
um the government creating&nbsp;
these for and to utilize for

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:29.680
just data collection. That is the only&nbsp;
thing that I feel I witnessed was to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:42.240
track of the progress in the sessions. Um to&nbsp;
record everything to like Yeah. Interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:51.440
Mhm. That's that's what I witnessed as the main&nbsp;
purpose. Thank you for sharing that. that might&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:57.200
jog somebody's memory or maybe other people&nbsp;
have, you know, seen something similar. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:03.520
another piece of your puzzle that I want to make&nbsp;
sure that we talk about to sort of create all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:10.560
different layers that you were accessed from.&nbsp;
Um, so you had a neighbor and had a child that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:16.080
was one of your best friends and yes, it might&nbsp;
have been your actual best friend growing up. you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:20.160
could share about that, but maybe you could&nbsp;
talk a little bit about that family as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:29.280
because that had a big part as well in your&nbsp;
perpetration and sort of where you headed to.

01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:38.480
So, I'm actually just having a sip of water. Sure,&nbsp;
absolutely. Please stay off cuz you know this does&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:51.680
it jogs a lot and it your brain starts to get&nbsp;
like woo um you're jogging a lot of things loose.

01:40:51.680 --> 01:41:03.360
my best friend who since I was 2 years old, our&nbsp;
parents met in a supermarket where her father&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:10.000
came up to my mother and said, "Oh, like I have a&nbsp;
daughter about her age and that's how they became&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:16.480
friends." Which of course makes me think that that&nbsp;
could have even been a target. Who knows, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:29.120
Um, but we became best friends. Um, like I even&nbsp;
just remember the first time her coming over and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:37.520
um playing with me and the babysitter being left&nbsp;
with us and we kept like opening the door. The cat&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:42.160
was supposed to stay in a certain room and we kept&nbsp;
opening it up like she kept putting a rubber band&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:47.680
on the door to keep these French doors closed&nbsp;
and we kept opening it and letting the cat in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:47.680 --> 01:42:05.840
and um and her family, she lived on&nbsp;
at the highest point in Amaget. Um and

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:12.080
her family lived next door to

01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:17.840
the Warner I mean the it was the family of&nbsp;
Warner Brothers. If you look up if you look&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:24.880
at who you know created Warner Brothers, it&nbsp;
was the heir to the Warner Brothers and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:37.440
family and we would get in her family would&nbsp;
get invited to these sort of like suarees,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:48.000
tent parties, very fancy. They had&nbsp;
a a large property and while I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.080
at my friend's house having a we used&nbsp;
to switch off sleepovers, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:54.080 --> 01:43:05.920
different weekends and if I w was at their house,&nbsp;
we went to these parties a few times and you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:14.960
we would dress up. I would wear like a dress and&nbsp;
tights and little like Mary Jane shoes and go and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:25.120
play with the other kids that were there. And&nbsp;
the, you know, adults would be dressed up. And

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:34.800
I mean, it was like not just like a tent that&nbsp;
is um like a wedding party that has a a tent&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:40.960
and there's grass inside. This was a tent&nbsp;
that was decked out like internal, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:49.600
inside furniture. Fancy curtains like on the&nbsp;
inside the velvet curtains that could be closed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:49.600 --> 01:44:02.000
with like these luxurious rope ties, you know. Um,&nbsp;
it it kind of look it started off like a normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:16.160
party in a sense with a maybe like a a weird air&nbsp;
around it. And then they would do something like

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:23.120
light like um light flickering type of&nbsp;
things. And there was a shift in energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:31.440
and adults would put on these robes that really&nbsp;
a lot of the robes looked I would say almost&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:41.680
identical. I just remember like&nbsp;
black sort of satiny silky robes and

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:45.600
there would be

01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:56.320
teenage kids walking on like&nbsp;
crawling on all fours serving

01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:10.160
on like a silver tray like orves&nbsp;
on their back And us children would

01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:16.960
get masks put on our faces and so that&nbsp;
we could not see who was doing what,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:23.440
but we were in the center of the circle. like&nbsp;
we would they would have us line up. So we would&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:30.160
be on the inner circle, the adults would be on&nbsp;
the outer and it was like we were being passed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:48.240
around in these fetishes type of things. Um and I&nbsp;
don't even have all of the memories of that. Um so

01:45:48.240 --> 01:45:52.160
whether there was a like any kind of penetration&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:52.160 --> 01:46:02.400
I don't know but there w there&nbsp;
is one thing that I did remember

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:12.240
before that which was like a testing to see I&nbsp;
won't get too into detail because it's just but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:24.320
essentially What they do is they can test&nbsp;
a child with like an instrument to see to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:29.920
make sure that a child's not going to show&nbsp;
signs of abuse or of penetration. It's like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:39.840
a it's like a gynecological tool. Um, and&nbsp;
I mean these people are sophisticated and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:47.440
they understand it and whether it was filmed or&nbsp;
not because there were celebrities there. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:55.280
I used to go home and tell my mother like,&nbsp;
"Oh, Sy Sales was at this party." And um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:03.680
it's possible I met Jimmy Savile, although he&nbsp;
ran in a more like, you know, UK circle. Like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:16.480
there was access to a lot of these people. And&nbsp;
it is possible it was filmed as blackmail. Um,

01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:25.600
I don't know all of that, but I know that we were

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:34.160
essentially like I remember pin the tail on the&nbsp;
donkey being played except it wasn't a p it wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:42.960
like the it was for fetish purposes like to to&nbsp;
to engage like adults and children interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:54.320
interacting and touching um foot things&nbsp;
happening like yeah um inappropriate&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:06.080
absolutely not appropriate one of their films&nbsp;
is used in MK Ultra it's one of the most famous&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:15.680
um programming tools their movie along with like&nbsp;
Alice in Wonderland, which is another very famous&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:28.560
programming tool. Their movie is that famous. Some&nbsp;
of the that family knows they've had trauma. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:37.360
that part is one of the hardest things&nbsp;
for a survivor is to not be validated,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:49.040
to only be given clues. Um, for example, the the&nbsp;
I have been validated on certain levels by Ingo&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:55.680
Swan's friend who was my father's friend. I mean,&nbsp;
he straight up has admitted to me that he worked&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:55.680 --> 01:49:03.840
with Ingo Swan and I have that in a what's up&nbsp;
conversation like spelt out, but he did not admit&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:14.720
to like that level of perpetration. So because&nbsp;
these people don't want to be implicated. So

01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:24.320
that part for a survivor is one of&nbsp;
the most brutal things. If you rely on

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:35.840
having your memories corroborated by another&nbsp;
human, that part is really hard, you know. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:41.440
especially if they're still active in whatever&nbsp;
cult or coven that they're involved in, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:47.920
and some people don't get memories back very&nbsp;
young, if at all, you know, and if they do,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:53.440
it's easy for these cults a lot of times to&nbsp;
reprogram them. So they sort of forget all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:58.560
over again or just are so scattered that they,&nbsp;
you know, they're not able to piece it together&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:03.120
as eloquently as you have, which is really sad,&nbsp;
you know, because then this ends up like really&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:08.400
breaking up families and friends and causing&nbsp;
so much dysfunction on so many levels, whether&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:16.480
consciously or not. You know, the rift of memory&nbsp;
and and how it can unfold into a dysfunction of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:16.480 --> 01:50:20.800
its own. you know, remembering what a life was&nbsp;
like and all of a sudden you're losing friends&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:26.560
and family and and you know, people around you for&nbsp;
your awareness. It's very bizarre and confusing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:32.080
you know, and and it's ultimately sad. It's like&nbsp;
I wish everybody in these in these systems could&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:38.080
come out the other side like you and want to be on&nbsp;
the survivor side versus still being victimized,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:38.080 --> 01:50:42.400
you know? And unfortunately, so rare&nbsp;
that that happens where people regain&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:49.120
consciousness and memory integration and it&nbsp;
really is a miracle. And it's it's crazy to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:53.520
hear just all these different situations like&nbsp;
living so many lives in one life. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:57.920
you wake up one day or I should say one day you&nbsp;
go to sleep and you're aware that you lived one&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:02.800
life that maybe wasn't perfect but it also wasn't&nbsp;
horrible. You wake up the next day and you realize&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:02.800 --> 01:51:08.240
you were living 10 lives at once and one seemed&nbsp;
okay and the other ones were, you know, absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:16.080
horrific and you were around all these people that&nbsp;
you didn't really realize had a part in abuse,

01:51:16.080 --> 01:51:24.800
you know, it's just got to be really a lot to&nbsp;
contend with. It is. And um at a certain point&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:24.800 --> 01:51:30.960
I thought I was going to live in a mental&nbsp;
hospital for the rest of my life because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:39.440
I just did not know how I was ever going to&nbsp;
put all the fractured pieces back together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:39.440 --> 01:51:49.840
and and it it left me pretty hopeless for a&nbsp;
like a large chunk of time where I was just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:49.840 --> 01:52:04.320
very much in a dysfunctional depressed and&nbsp;
passively suicidal um you know mentality. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:18.320
um it it definitely was I mean I had to do so many&nbsp;
things on my healing journey and um I mean I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:30.480
say the spiritual part you know connecting to&nbsp;
to Jesus to Yeshua to um my angelic counsel&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:30.480 --> 01:52:37.440
plant medicine helped me a plant called ibogga&nbsp;
helped me a lot. I mean, there were multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:52.320
things that that helped and just like doing that&nbsp;
work on like putting myself back together and um

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:57.920
yeah, I wish for others.

01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:05.120
It's just one of the hardest things to do, but it&nbsp;
is possible. And it's even possible when you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:15.440
been shattered into a million pieces because and I&nbsp;
I'm going to venture to say that because I wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:22.640
that cooperative. I I we didn't even like quite&nbsp;
get into all of that, but I sort of like failed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:31.360
out of some of that project Stargate. I mean,&nbsp;
they just kept accessing me and well, if she's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:39.440
not going to do that, we're going to test this on&nbsp;
her. Like, they really tried to shatter me. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:49.680
and it didn't work. I mean, it did, but it&nbsp;
didn't. And uh because the spirit is stronger&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:49.680 --> 01:54:08.000
um and our connection to a divine plan is stronger&nbsp;
if we can all be so lucky to remember ours,

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:16.240
you know, and get those original memories back.&nbsp;
Not just of the abuse but of the connection to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:26.400
ultimate source. Yes. You know, absolutely. Yes.&nbsp;
And your story really does span so much. And I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:34.000
know we kind of covered the the groundwork on it.&nbsp;
Yeah. And I wanted to say my friend's family also&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:45.760
was doing Luciferian practices and was possibly&nbsp;
even connected because her father used to wear&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:59.680
a robe in the house with a um it had an emblem&nbsp;
of a wolf. Uh sorry, a sheep unmasking to reveal&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:07.040
a wolf. A wolf in sheep's clothes essentially&nbsp;
was their emblem. That is Fabian society which&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:17.280
is directly connected to the UK and communism.&nbsp;
It's a and they're a pro pedophilia group. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:27.120
connected to um Harriet Harmon is the woman. So&nbsp;
I've had to just like I said be my own detective&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:36.320
looking up these things and figuring it out.&nbsp;
But like if you follow, if you have the courage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:46.720
you know, and the will to follow these leads,&nbsp;
you will find it and figure it out. Whether the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:58.240
perpetrators ever admit to anything or not,&nbsp;
like you will come to know your own story.

01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:04.000
Yeah. Amen to that. And what a miracle it is&nbsp;
that you and others have gotten to a place&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:10.160
where you can be so integrated through a memory&nbsp;
perspective to to understand it even if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:15.840
know every little thing. Just to have the pieces&nbsp;
that you can start putting together and even if&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.880
there's a couple missing pieces to understand&nbsp;
what you went through. It's it can really set&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:27.040
you on a path to healing and help you know help&nbsp;
you regain control over your nervous system and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:31.200
how all those things initially feel whenever&nbsp;
you start remembering them which can be really&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:41.760
horrifying. Mhm. Oh yeah. Yeah. It can be really&nbsp;
really scary. And when I first started to remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:51.760
I nearly lost it. And I remember I called this&nbsp;
one author I forget her name. Ellen Lectar, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:51.760 --> 01:57:02.960
think it was. She wrote a book, right? End ritual&nbsp;
abuse, right? I called her in 2013 and was like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:10.080
"Oh my god, I've been through this." And at that&nbsp;
point, no one was really talking about it except&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:15.440
for maybe Kathy O'Brien or, you know, there was&nbsp;
a couple. Yeah. And she did not stay on the phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:21.600
very long with me. So, I didn't understand even&nbsp;
what I had stumbled upon fully. I just She said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:26.080
"I can't stay on the phone with you very&nbsp;
long." Like, I wanted her to be my therapist&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:31.600
immediately cuz that's the work she used to do.&nbsp;
And before she was writing her books and she said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:37.600
"I don't do this work with one-on-one survivors&nbsp;
anymore." And I said, "Oh, is it because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:44.640
too painful?" She said, "That's not why." and she&nbsp;
she's like, "I can't stay too long on the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:52.320
but" And she walked she said, "Just know&nbsp;
everyone around you likely is involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:52.320 --> 01:58:01.920
in some way in the in in in this." And she's&nbsp;
like, "You can do it. Like, you can do this."&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:11.280
She kind of just gave me some encouragement,&nbsp;
but I would It's utterly frightening.

01:58:11.280 --> 01:58:17.120
It is. And you have an incredible journey&nbsp;
of healing and then on the other side of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:23.280
that becoming a healer. And I think it would be&nbsp;
amazing to do a part two where we go into that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:28.000
part of your story. And you know, I'll obviously&nbsp;
let if there's anything else that you wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.640
cover today, we can talk about that. But one&nbsp;
thing I really did want to talk about um maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:38.000
after we we close up, anything else that you&nbsp;
wanted to share about those childhood years?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.960
You are a healer and I I want to spend a little&nbsp;
bit of time sharing what it is that you do and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:49.200
how people can support you and ultimately hire&nbsp;
you, you know, if your services are something&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:54.160
that they're seeking right now because&nbsp;
there isn't a ton of help out there. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:57.920
um, wanted to sort of pass that over to you&nbsp;
if you wanted to talk about that or if there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:57.920 --> 01:59:01.840
was some other things that you wanted to tie&nbsp;
up with the other conversations that we had,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:01.840 --> 01:59:09.680
feel free to go into it. Okay. Um, yeah, there&nbsp;
was one other thing I did want to say. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:22.240
In connection to what we were just speaking of.&nbsp;
Uh, oh, I I just wanted to encourage like surviv&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:35.120
survivors who are uncovering their memories and it&nbsp;
feels like the neverending like Pandora's box. Um,

01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:40.240
and you do feel like you're being bombarded&nbsp;
not just with the memories but possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:50.400
gangstalking or like where you feel there&nbsp;
are real threats still like happening. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:50.400 --> 02:00:01.440
think a big key in this is to keep your&nbsp;
vibration as high as you possibly can.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:09.120
Because that and really connect whether you&nbsp;
believe in God or not or higher divinity&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:24.640
source like connecting to your highest light&nbsp;
like it brings you up. It elevates you and

02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:32.720
it's like these these things can't touch you&nbsp;
anymore. And I just wanted to put that out there&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:42.720
because I know on top of uncovering things&nbsp;
and working on healing, unraveling really,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:52.480
really painful things that you're reliving&nbsp;
um on top of being bombarded say still by&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:59.360
perpetrators or that energy or feeling it's&nbsp;
like a double whammy. And so I think like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:09.440
real key is spiritual nourishment, keeping your&nbsp;
vibration really high. There's obviously so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:09.440 --> 02:01:16.400
layers to that as well. I love that spiritual&nbsp;
nourishment. That's a really great way to word&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:26.480
that. Yeah. Yeah. And I wish I knew I had&nbsp;
known all of that then because my healing&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:35.280
journey was really bumpy in a lot of ways,&nbsp;
especially in the beginning. And now look&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:35.280 --> 02:01:41.520
at you now. You're speaking on podcasts. You're&nbsp;
helping others through their own trauma. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:47.280
what a turnaround you've made since&nbsp;
remembering and taking action on your&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:47.280 --> 02:01:53.360
healing. It's really amazing to see you on the&nbsp;
other side of this now. Thank you. Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:53.360 --> 02:02:04.800
Yeah. Yeah. I feel much more at peace and&nbsp;
I've done a lot of healing and integration

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:13.760
and um you know you had asked what what I do.&nbsp;
So what services I have I mean I I am involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:13.760 --> 02:02:23.440
in the arts. I have done um a film production and&nbsp;
I am a painter and a musician. Um but my healing&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:31.600
work and I love helping other survivors and I do&nbsp;
help other survivors and non-s survivors of you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:40.160
know SRRA and MK Ultra. It can be you know life is&nbsp;
traumatic. Um, I work with people and I do inner&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:56.000
child deliverance with with Jesus with Yeshua. So&nbsp;
essentially I I connect with him and and Jesus is&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:05.440
and was an ascended being who graduated and he&nbsp;
went through as we know like a slew of trauma.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:15.360
But I have been speaking with Jesus since I am a&nbsp;
child. And he has manifested as plain as day in&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:26.800
front of me and been speaking to me, wanting me to&nbsp;
um spread his wisdom, which I've agreed to since&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:41.760
I'm a child. Um, and he has healed wounds on my&nbsp;
on my skin. Um, like I cut myself once playing on&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:41.760 --> 02:03:53.760
my finger and he healed it. Um, he is a light&nbsp;
worker, an ascended master being. And so what&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:53.760 --> 02:04:05.120
I like to do for other people is I like to relay&nbsp;
messages. When people, you know, come to me with&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:13.680
sort of their life situation, looking for certain&nbsp;
guidance, I work with him for their guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:20.560
I don't like to necessarily call it channeling&nbsp;
because sometimes people affiliate that word,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:30.320
you know, I'm a conduit of of him and my healing&nbsp;
also is affiliated with and comes from him. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:39.600
comes from the Holy Spirit and um that's what I&nbsp;
do. So I work with people energetically through&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:50.800
him and with messages from him and and I also&nbsp;
you know there are it's it is up to us we&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:50.800 --> 02:05:03.120
can you know god can heal us instantaneously&nbsp;
but because we're on this human path journey

02:05:03.120 --> 02:05:11.680
you know we want to do our own work too&nbsp;
and So the inner child deliverance work,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:19.840
I really like that because the the child&nbsp;
ego parts that got wounded can be healed&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:34.320
with his guidance. And so I do that to heal the&nbsp;
wounded parts with people, with clients. That's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:40.160
so beautiful. again. Look how cool that is that&nbsp;
you know you were the one seeking help and now&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:40.160 --> 02:05:45.520
you're able to help other people through their own&nbsp;
journey after all the healing that you did. Like&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:45.520 --> 02:05:50.800
what a cool gift to give to the world. I know&nbsp;
that there there are a lot of survivors. I get&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:58.240
emails pretty frequently from survivors looking&nbsp;
for recommendations for healing, for therapy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:58.240 --> 02:06:03.280
um for people that can, you know, help deliver&nbsp;
them. There's so many things that survivors need&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:03.280 --> 02:06:07.840
in their journey. If somebody heard what you just&nbsp;
said and it resonates with them and they're like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:07.840 --> 02:06:10.800
"That's exactly what I need. I really want to&nbsp;
reach out to her. I want to work directly with&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:19.200
a survivor. How can get in touch with you?"&nbsp;
Um, so I just set up a new like anonymous&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:37.040
uh Instagram and that is uh let's see.&nbsp;
I'm like, "Okay, so we're Magnolia777

02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:44.640
and they can DM me and then I&nbsp;
I did set up an email with that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:53.760
as well and that is magnolia trinity@gmail.com.

02:06:53.760 --> 02:07:03.120
like my phone number can be provided as well&nbsp;
through you if anyone reaches out directly to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:10.960
You could you could give my number to like say&nbsp;
someone who is looking to you know work with like&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:20.080
do this kind of work. And I also just want to say&nbsp;
I have done multiple deliverances through other&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:30.160
deliverance coaches. So, I am a clean vessel.&nbsp;
Um, I've had exorcisms. I've had exorcisms with&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:39.840
um interrogation, which is like crazy. Uh,&nbsp;
I mean, you know, where each any part of you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:48.080
that is still like giving to a certain energy or&nbsp;
entity is being like really pressed and and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:55.920
brought into into line in line. Um, I don't work&nbsp;
that harshly. I find that can get a little too&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:55.920 --> 02:08:07.120
cerebral. I really work with Holy Spirit. It's&nbsp;
very gentle and loving and pure. Yeah. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:13.600
I definitely encourage people to reach out&nbsp;
and support. Um, one of the easiest things&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:19.680
if you're not seeking her guidance through a&nbsp;
healing. Um, one of the easiest things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:24.960
that the rest of you can do is go follow her&nbsp;
on social media and just support her content,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:30.560
share it on your stories, connect with it, comment&nbsp;
on it. You know, survivors often get really buried&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:36.560
in the mix of the algorithm. And it's sad because&nbsp;
other people speak over them who are not survivors&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:41.360
and who are not helping survivors or even engaging&nbsp;
with them or giving them credit. They're basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:47.280
taking their information, profiting off of it, um,&nbsp;
pretending that it's their own research, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:52.640
and and then these survivors just get sort of&nbsp;
tossed to the wind. Their information is being&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:52.640 --> 02:08:59.120
exploited again, you know, their experiences and&nbsp;
uh, society continues to look away from them. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:03.840
one of the easiest things that we can do as&nbsp;
a society to support survivors is if they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:09.120
on social media to just follow them. It's free,&nbsp;
it's easy, and so is sharing their content. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:14.000
for the rest of you who who aren't going to&nbsp;
contact her, or aren't looking for healing, I'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:20.240
have her Instagram below and encourage you guys to&nbsp;
just go support as an ally, as an advocate, as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:27.440
support system. Um, help engage with her content,&nbsp;
get it seen by more people. Um, and of course, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:34.800
share her links, her email, share her social media&nbsp;
with any survivors you might know if you are also,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:38.480
uh, working with them or if you are&nbsp;
somebody that connects with them online.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:42.960
and follows them. If you see somebody&nbsp;
struggling who might need a helping hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:47.600
um you have another resource now. So, please&nbsp;
help share her information to anybody who might&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:53.360
be in need as well in your life. Um those things&nbsp;
work absolute wonders to help support survivors&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:58.800
and it's free. You know, it's a really easy thing&nbsp;
that we can all collectively do together. Um and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:03.360
really appreciate Magnolia all the work that you&nbsp;
have done. Again, it's it's just so neat seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:03.360 --> 02:10:10.640
you on the other side of here and impossible to&nbsp;
imagine where you came from, knowing where you are&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:16.400
right now. You know, it's it's like the darkest of&nbsp;
the dark to the absolute brightest light. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:21.200
amazing the journey that you've gone on. I feel&nbsp;
like you're still just beginning and just getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:25.920
started on it even though you've been going for&nbsp;
so long, but you've learned so much, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:33.920
and and over a decade of of healing and trying out&nbsp;
different things. You know, what a resource you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:38.960
can be now to people who need guidance and advice&nbsp;
through their hardest times. And you've gotten to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:45.200
sort of see a big evolution of this movement where&nbsp;
even, you know, 2013 hardly anybody was talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:50.160
about this stuff besides maybe Kathy O'Brien and&nbsp;
a couple other survivors that you could find if&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:56.400
you really dug. You know, now there's a lot more&nbsp;
voices chiming in and you know, with all this with&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:00.000
all this time under your belt that you've gotten&nbsp;
to spend trying all these different things and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:04.880
learning and seeing the evolution. You know,&nbsp;
it's great having you on the forefront now as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:09.760
public speaker. you know, getting to share all of&nbsp;
this with people and providing your puzzle piece&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:09.760 --> 02:11:14.080
now after you got so many puzzle pieces from&nbsp;
other people who helped you along the way. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:22.480
congratulations on all levels. Thank you so much.&nbsp;
I'm really going to I'm working on receiving like&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:30.960
taking that in and like really just taking it in&nbsp;
as a truth. You know, it's sometimes hard to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:39.200
like, "Wow, I really have done that." So, thank&nbsp;
you. Um, you're so welcome. Yeah, thank you. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:49.600
um, thank you so much for giving me the platform&nbsp;
to share this and um, yeah, it's my honor. We all&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:55.120
need to know this stuff and face it even if it's&nbsp;
uncomfortable to listen to. And yes, and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:55.120 --> 02:12:04.720
well, it has to stop. I mean, it it's this is not&nbsp;
this is like a monstrous cycle on the planet that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:17.200
through awareness like it has to stop. These&nbsp;
like like these bloodlines have to heal. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:27.440
is not the way. This is not the way to go,&nbsp;
you know. Absolutely. I couldn't agree more&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:32.320
because that's I think when people initially&nbsp;
hear of this, you know, their initial reaction&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:36.640
is grab the pitchforks and let's just go kill&nbsp;
them all off. And it's so much more complex&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:36.640 --> 02:12:41.920
than that. And because we don't know about trauma&nbsp;
and the different types of ways trauma can affect&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:47.840
somebody from turning them into a psychopath to&nbsp;
making them a victim that they need freed from,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:53.600
you know, making them a slave that they do not&nbsp;
want to be. There's different levels of how we&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:57.680
need to approach all of this. You know, ultimately&nbsp;
we want everybody, like how I was saying earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:03.520
to no matter what they've done, no matter how bad&nbsp;
it was, we want everybody to come out and say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:07.680
"All right, I'm going to wipe my hands clean.&nbsp;
I'm defecting from this. Enough is enough. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:12.560
breaking the cycle just like Magnolia did, just&nbsp;
like Kathy O'Brien did. I want to be on that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:19.760
side." You know, you're going to also have the&nbsp;
people who are they're unchangeable psychopaths.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:19.760 --> 02:13:26.720
like they just don't have the capacity to heal,&nbsp;
you know, even if even if we want them to. And so&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:32.320
understanding these different levels of the&nbsp;
types of of victimization that happens, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:38.000
side effects of it, the fracturing and the damage&nbsp;
that it does, and the different levels of damage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:42.800
what can be healed from, what can't be. You know,&nbsp;
it's so important that we understand this because&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:47.440
that's going to be the key to stopping it is&nbsp;
realizing how deeply embedded generationally&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:52.640
it is and that it's not just a swift one and done.&nbsp;
We just take everybody out and it stops. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:57.920
this goes back so many generations and it's it's&nbsp;
still being perpetrated so many generations below&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:04.640
us. And so having that understanding can really&nbsp;
help us empathize where it needs empathized and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:10.480
accept with open arms the people who you know&nbsp;
if they knew that they could be safe they they'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:16.160
have arms to walk into that would accept them back&nbsp;
into society and want them to heal just like how&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:20.960
you know you have done and countless others. Um,&nbsp;
and then also knowing where to throw the hammer&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:26.080
of justice and to say, "All right, if you're not,&nbsp;
if you aren't going to take the initiative to want&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:31.120
to heal and to come out of this and to stop what&nbsp;
you're doing, then we have to figure out the right&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:37.120
way to, you know, persecute and, you know, bring&nbsp;
justice to those people um who have no intention&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:41.920
of stopping, you So hearing all of this really&nbsp;
helps us understand the different layers not just&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:47.600
of how these stories and networks work, but the&nbsp;
different layers of perpetration, victimization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:53.120
and the side effects of that, you know, and how&nbsp;
we can stop this if we take the time to actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:59.360
understand trauma, you know, and how it affects&nbsp;
society, how it affects the individual, how it&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:06.400
affects a family, you know, and how powerful it is&nbsp;
that people people take that initiative no matter&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:06.400 --> 02:15:10.480
what the risk is and and say Enough is enough&nbsp;
just like what you did and have the courage to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:20.880
walk away from it. Yes. Yeah. I totally agree. And&nbsp;
it's a it's an evolution of consciousness. Like I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:30.240
I just see it as I mean I can't help but see it&nbsp;
as like the the cycles and waves of the planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:41.200
I'm like, how many more generations is this going&nbsp;
to go on before it is like exiled from the planet?&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:41.200 --> 02:15:50.800
Like this is like I just think the more exposure&nbsp;
and less from a victim standpoint of Yeah. like&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:59.120
let's go with the pitchforks like and more like&nbsp;
bringing light and awareness and healing to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:59.120 --> 02:16:11.600
for it to make its way off the planet like so we&nbsp;
can go back to the light and bring heaven on earth&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:20.800
essentially which is like what I believe is&nbsp;
the goal of being here we're We're supposed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:31.040
unify back to the lightest of the light, like our&nbsp;
divinity, and bring it here to this fallen world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:38.720
you know. Amen to that. And with leaders like you&nbsp;
who lead with love and compassion, but also know&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:38.720 --> 02:16:46.000
boundaries, how to put your foot down and where&nbsp;
to execute um persecution, you know, and judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:51.200
This is, you know, this really is the way. And&nbsp;
it's not just one or the other. Like we have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:58.240
be in both um in both states of consciousness&nbsp;
of understanding this as a whole, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:03.679
and hearing these testimonies I think are the&nbsp;
way that that happens. And so again, I just I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:07.520
commend you. You're brilliant. You're incredible.&nbsp;
You're eloquent. I would have never guessed that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:12.800
this is like your first time coming on a platform&nbsp;
like this and thinking about it because you're so&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:12.800 --> 02:17:18.640
versed and like you're you're amazing uh public&nbsp;
speaker. Oh my goodness. Thank you. At first, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:26.000
felt like there was a big blank and I was nervous&nbsp;
at first, but thank you for saying that. You did&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.399
wonderful and I'm really excited to have you&nbsp;
back on and to dig into more parts of your story&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:30.399 --> 02:17:36.160
because we covered so much today. This is like&nbsp;
a jam-packed episode, but Yes. Yes. So many more&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:42.479
layers to your story, including I do. But I feel&nbsp;
we covered really like all the groups, like a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:42.479 --> 02:17:48.799
of groundwork actually, 100%. And next time we can&nbsp;
always go over and sort of polish it off anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:56.160
that um we didn't include this time and uh move&nbsp;
into different aspects of your story um on part&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:00.559
two. So I'm really excited to have you back on and&nbsp;
really appreciate you Magnolia coming on today and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:07.680
sharing with us and giving us your puzzle piece.&nbsp;
Thank you so much, Emma. Thank you. Really,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:12.080
you're welcome. It's an honor. It's the least we&nbsp;
can do is is listen to all of this after you had&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:16.479
to endure and survive it. So, it's my great honor&nbsp;
to be able to do this and I know other people on&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:16.479 --> 02:18:20.799
the other side of the screen feel the same way.&nbsp;
And so, for everybody listening on the other side&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:26.800
of the screen, I will have Magnolia's email below&nbsp;
as well as her Instagram. Go support her if you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:30.720
a survivor or not. And then, of course, if you&nbsp;
are a survivor of any kind or somebody dealing&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:36.960
with trauma or PTSD or just needing to sort of&nbsp;
move forward in your healing, if you're stuck,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:43.200
um you have a resource. So, please reach out&nbsp;
to her and see if um you know it's a good fit&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:47.920
on both ends and if if what you're going through&nbsp;
is something she can help you with. Um but please&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:47.920 --> 02:18:53.520
share her information as well with with with&nbsp;
other wounded warriors who might be privy to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:53.520 --> 02:18:58.560
you know, wanting somebody that can help them walk&nbsp;
through their healing journey. And uh so I'll have&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:03.040
all that below. And I really encourage you guys&nbsp;
to help share and elevate her and to share this&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:09.359
episode with people um that you think would find&nbsp;
value and education and and ultimately just people&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:09.359 --> 02:19:14.479
curious about learning the the ins and outs of&nbsp;
the world like we're curious about it. And I'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:14.479 --> 02:19:19.359
have all my information below as well. Follow me&nbsp;
wherever you guys can. We couldn't do this without&nbsp;&nbsp;
