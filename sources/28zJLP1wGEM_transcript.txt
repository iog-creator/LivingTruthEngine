Kind: captions Language: en Heavenly Father, today we put on the full armor&nbsp; to protect us against attack. We put on the belt&nbsp;&nbsp; of truth to protect against lies and deception. We&nbsp; put on the breastplate of righteousness to protect&nbsp;&nbsp; our hearts from the temptations. We put the gospel&nbsp; of peace on our feet to walk in your light, peace,&nbsp;&nbsp; and freedom with the Holy Spirit. We rebuke&nbsp; anxious thoughts. We take up your shield of&nbsp;&nbsp; faith for protection to block and destroy all&nbsp; the darts and threats thrown at us by the enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We put on the helmet of salvation to cover our&nbsp; minds and thoughts, reminding us that we are&nbsp;&nbsp; children of a mighty king. We are forgiven, set&nbsp; free, saved by the blood of Jesus. We take up the&nbsp;&nbsp; sword of the spirit, your living word that has the&nbsp; power to demolish strongholds and is sharper than&nbsp;&nbsp; any double-edged sword. We come to you, Lord, in&nbsp; prayer daily. In Jesus mighty name we pray. Amen.&nbsp;&nbsp; What's up, you guys? Welcome to the Imagination.&nbsp; I'm your host, Emma, and today I'm honored to have&nbsp;&nbsp; back on the show for part two of her testimony&nbsp; series, Satanic Ritual Abuse, Mind Control,&nbsp;&nbsp; Stargate, Freemason, Jesuit, an organized abuse&nbsp; survivor, overcomer, and whistleblower, loving&nbsp;&nbsp; mother, founder of The Quickening Project, content&nbsp; creator and podcast host, faithful servant to the&nbsp;&nbsp; most high, gardener, floral design extraordinaire,&nbsp; singer and songwriter, poetry reader and writer,&nbsp;&nbsp; and absolute inspiration, Kadia. In case you&nbsp; missed Kadia's incredible debut episode on this&nbsp;&nbsp; podcast, it'll be below in the show notes.&nbsp; And here is a brief overview of her life,&nbsp;&nbsp; as well as some things we may be discussing&nbsp; today for part two. Kadia's life began in a&nbsp;&nbsp; web of multi-generational abuse orchestrated by a&nbsp; highle cult with ties to Freemasonry, the Vatican,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Jesuits, and military intelligence programs.&nbsp; From infancy, and possibly even Udo, she endured&nbsp;&nbsp; deliberate trauma designed to fracture her psyche,&nbsp; creating dissociative identity disorder to mold&nbsp;&nbsp; her into a mind-controlled operative. Raised&nbsp; in a seemingly happy Christian family, Kadia's&nbsp;&nbsp; front personality was unaware of the horrific&nbsp; rituals and programming conducted in churches,&nbsp;&nbsp; Masonic lodges, and even a major movie theater&nbsp; that shaped her fragmented identities. These&nbsp;&nbsp; included being trafficked to the Vatican for a&nbsp; luciferian ritual, subjected to electroshock,&nbsp;&nbsp; drowning, and drugging to simulate death, and&nbsp; training in programs like Stargate for remote&nbsp;&nbsp; viewing and espionage. As a child, she was forced&nbsp; to participate in heinous acts, including filming&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff films on a church missing trip under the&nbsp; guise of helping an orphanage. Her abusers,&nbsp;&nbsp; including a 33rd degree Freemason programmer&nbsp; who studied neurology to perfect mind control,&nbsp;&nbsp; exploited her high IQ and spiritual gifts,&nbsp; using children's books like Dr. Seuss and&nbsp;&nbsp; the music and keys of a piano to create&nbsp; a highly organized system of altars.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite this, Kadia's awakening began in her 20s&nbsp; when chronic illness defied medical diagnosis,&nbsp;&nbsp; hinting at trauma-based origins. As memories of&nbsp; ritual abuse flooded back just a few years ago,&nbsp;&nbsp; she faced disbelief from family, friends, and&nbsp; authorities, culminating in a betrayal that cost&nbsp;&nbsp; her everything. Her husband filed for divorce. A&nbsp; protection order barred her from her two children,&nbsp;&nbsp; and her resources were stripped away. The&nbsp; cult's playbook using the Darvo method left&nbsp;&nbsp; her ostracized, gangstaled, and battling self&nbsp; harm programming. Yet guided by her faith,&nbsp;&nbsp; Kadiah found refuge with a supportive family and&nbsp; enrolled in Restoration in Christ Ministries, a&nbsp;&nbsp; program that became a cornerstone of her healing.&nbsp; Kadia's escape was a miracle marked by divine&nbsp;&nbsp; intervention, including surviving a kidnapping&nbsp; attempt. Her faith in Yaw became her anchor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognizing that Christian terminology and music,&nbsp; often used in rituals, can retraumatize survivors,&nbsp;&nbsp; Kadia launched the Quickening Project, a&nbsp; podcast and music initiative. She creates&nbsp;&nbsp; worship music designed to soothe fractured souls&nbsp; without triggering trauma, and she offers a safe&nbsp;&nbsp; space for survivors to reconnect with faith. The&nbsp; project also educates on the realities of SRRA,&nbsp;&nbsp; did and cult tactics, exposing the prevalence&nbsp; in institutions like churches, schools, and&nbsp;&nbsp; even pizza chains used as friends for trafficking.&nbsp; Today, we will be continuing Kadaya's testimony,&nbsp;&nbsp; sharing aspects of her story that weren't&nbsp; discussed last time. And some of those topics will&nbsp;&nbsp; be things like mind control programming locations,&nbsp; psychward experiences, youth method, abuse methods&nbsp;&nbsp; that do not leave marks, and sematic body memory&nbsp; experiences, SRA and scripture, Antarctica,&nbsp;&nbsp; the state sanctioned kidnap of children, and so&nbsp; much more. Kadia's mission is not of vengeance,&nbsp;&nbsp; but of healing and empowerment. Her work addresses&nbsp; the epidemic of hidden abuse, drawing parallels to&nbsp;&nbsp; biblical warnings of lawlessness and false light.&nbsp; By sharing her testimony, she validates survivors,&nbsp;&nbsp; showing them that the cult's tactics, like&nbsp; weaponizing children or inducing despair,&nbsp;&nbsp; are proof of their truth. Her message is&nbsp; clear. Healing is possible through faith,&nbsp;&nbsp; honesty, and with the Holy Spirit. Kadia's&nbsp; story, still unfolding as she fights to&nbsp;&nbsp; unite with her children, is a powerful call to&nbsp; action. inspiring survivors to break free and&nbsp;&nbsp; society to confront the darkness in plain sight.&nbsp; Through things like the Quickening Project,&nbsp;&nbsp; Kadia is not just surviving, she is thriving and&nbsp; turning her pain into a divine purpose to set the&nbsp;&nbsp; captives free.

Your support&nbsp;&nbsp; means the absolute world to me and to every guest&nbsp; on this show. So you guys, without further ado,&nbsp;&nbsp; please help me in welcoming back today's guest&nbsp; of honor, voice for the voiceless, woman of God,&nbsp;&nbsp; survivor, warrior, fierce mama bear, walking&nbsp; miracle, anti-child abuse, and survivor advocate,&nbsp;&nbsp; and a woman on a mission to equip other survivors&nbsp; with what to expect when getting out through the&nbsp;&nbsp; power and hope of faith in Christ. The one,&nbsp; the only, Kadia. Kadaya, thank you so much for&nbsp;&nbsp; being here again with us today. I'm so happy&nbsp; to have you back. Thank you. Thank you. Wow,&nbsp;&nbsp; that was a wonderful intro. I'm humbled. Thanks&nbsp; for having me. And for those who've tuned in,&nbsp;&nbsp; thank you. It's an honor to have you back.&nbsp; Your last episode was received so well. And&nbsp;&nbsp; despite the fact that it was a longer episode&nbsp; jam-packed with things, we had so many good&nbsp;&nbsp; comments and it provided so many puzzle pieces&nbsp; for other people and helped them understand some&nbsp;&nbsp; of these big picture things that can be really&nbsp; hard to understand in the little snippets that&nbsp;&nbsp; we see online. So, I'm really thrilled to have&nbsp; you back and just so impressed with everything&nbsp;&nbsp; that you've learned, everything that you've done,&nbsp; all the healing that has taken place in such such&nbsp;&nbsp; a short amount of time, and how you're able to&nbsp; articulate these really, really hard concepts&nbsp;&nbsp; and experiences and things that exist in our&nbsp; world in such a palatable way. So, I'm thrilled&nbsp;&nbsp; to get into some of these subjects today. Um,&nbsp; we do have a lot. So, just to let people know,&nbsp;&nbsp; I did mention some things in the intro. if we&nbsp; don't get to all of them, Kadia did agree to&nbsp;&nbsp; do a part three. So, and obviously I'd want her&nbsp; on again anyways, but um if you don't hear about&nbsp;&nbsp; some of the topics today, we'll bring her back on&nbsp; again happily and dive into some of those things,&nbsp;&nbsp; but we're going to try to cover as much ground as&nbsp; we can today. Um, and one of the topics that that&nbsp;&nbsp; we really wanted to share and and talk a little&nbsp; bit deeper about is the topic of being admitted&nbsp;&nbsp; to psych wards, being called crazy after you start&nbsp; to remember these very real reactions that people&nbsp;&nbsp; in these cults and people around survivors have.&nbsp; Um, that sort of causes the opposite. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we should be embracing survivors with healing&nbsp; and help and helpful therapies that validate&nbsp;&nbsp; their experiences and instead um it's a very&nbsp; real situation that a lot of survivors get&nbsp;&nbsp; treated the opposite and um penalized for what&nbsp; they're remembering. And Kadia is no stranger&nbsp;&nbsp; to pretty much every experience you could sort of&nbsp; imagine somebody having from the success of being&nbsp;&nbsp; received on podcast to how her family treated her&nbsp; when a lot of this stuff started going down. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; Kadai, I'm going to turn it over to you and&nbsp; let you share um your experiences about this&nbsp;&nbsp; and we can kind of dive into this topic&nbsp; that's so relevant for survivors and that&nbsp;&nbsp; normal civilians in society really need to know&nbsp; about. Awesome. So, on the last interview we did&nbsp;&nbsp; uh we did dig into several of the topics that you&nbsp; mentioned which was awesome. I'm going to try not&nbsp;&nbsp; to be redundant uh with some of the anecdotes of&nbsp; information. So, I'm going to pick up where we&nbsp;&nbsp; left off pertaining to the timeline of events um&nbsp; regarding my health journey, some of the symptoms,&nbsp;&nbsp; uh my um the different people that I went&nbsp; to for help. Uh we talked about all of that,&nbsp;&nbsp; what happened, why I am where I am now. Um, but I&nbsp; want to just touch on some of the details of what&nbsp;&nbsp; happened in some of those situations with uh&nbsp; people that I had hoped to be able to trust,&nbsp;&nbsp; family members, uh, the authorities, um, pastors,&nbsp; that kind of thing. Uh, because I want to prepare&nbsp;&nbsp; those who are leaving these situations. And I I&nbsp; see this as, you know, I see that there's a mass&nbsp;&nbsp; exodus right now. Hallelujah. Um out of darkness&nbsp; and in uh to the light of truth by his grace&nbsp;&nbsp; alone. And by his grace, I mean God. And you're&nbsp; going to hear me refer to God um you're going&nbsp;&nbsp; to hear me refer to Jesus in a lot of the Hebrew&nbsp; language because a lot of the English language was&nbsp;&nbsp; um used in my programming. That's something else&nbsp; we talked about last time. Um, and so if you hear&nbsp;&nbsp; me use Yah or Yahwa or Yahweh, I know some people&nbsp; have controversy with that. Um, but that's just&nbsp;&nbsp; what I have tended to use. That's been helpful in&nbsp; my journey. So, if you hear me say that, uh, don't&nbsp;&nbsp; be concerned. I'll just say upfront that my faith&nbsp; is in the God of the Bible, the God of Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp; the one and true risen lamb, um Jesus Christ,&nbsp; Yeshua Hamashiach, uh the Messiah who has come&nbsp;&nbsp; to redeem us from the curse of sin and death and&nbsp; all of the things these cults love, all of these&nbsp;&nbsp; things that they do to enslave us. Um, and he&nbsp; has come to save us, to heal us, and he is coming&nbsp;&nbsp; again to exact justice on this kind of darkness,&nbsp; on these hidden cults, on this wickedness. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and uh, and uh, lead his people home. So, I&nbsp; want to talk about what happened pertaining&nbsp;&nbsp; to my children because that's not something that&nbsp; we mentioned. So, maybe I'll just start there.&nbsp;&nbsp; So uh this is you know one of the hardest things&nbsp; for me to stay present uh to talk about um one&nbsp;&nbsp; of the gifts of dissociation um is uh that I can&nbsp; um you know reach a a level in my point of grief&nbsp;&nbsp; um and then in order to be able to survive I&nbsp; can uh switch um into almost sort of a type&nbsp;&nbsp; of amnesia to be able to focus on other tasks at&nbsp; hand. It doesn't always work. There are a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; debilitating days where I suffer. So, uh, just&nbsp; bear with me. Um, if I, you know, space out or&nbsp;&nbsp; space off, um, just give me a minute just to kind&nbsp; of collect my thoughts and and come back. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, I was dealing with a lot of symptoms and&nbsp; one of those things that I was dealing with was&nbsp;&nbsp; dissociative seizures. uh dissociative seizures&nbsp; that were inhibiting my ability to function,&nbsp;&nbsp; to mother, uh to take care of my home, to work,&nbsp; and to eventually drive. So, there were some years&nbsp;&nbsp; um leading up to my psycho board stay where&nbsp; I was booking appointments with specialists,&nbsp;&nbsp; with neurologists. I had an EEG done to um try&nbsp; to uh establish where some of these seizurike uh&nbsp;&nbsp; electric like symptoms were coming from that were&nbsp; just causing debilitating pain and an inability to&nbsp;&nbsp; function. And um I had I didn't know that there&nbsp; was such a thing as dissociative seizures at the&nbsp;&nbsp; time. And unfortunately um clinicians this is just&nbsp; not something that is widely known about. And of&nbsp;&nbsp; course we know the whole medical establishment&nbsp; um including the the world of psychiatry is is&nbsp;&nbsp; designed to create a a a veil uh of of false&nbsp; help over um people who have who are victims of&nbsp;&nbsp; uh organized abuse especially. And so I wasn't&nbsp; able to get a diagnosis, but this was something&nbsp;&nbsp; that I was dealing with and it is still something&nbsp; that I'm dealing with in my healing journey.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are happening less frequently, but they&nbsp; still happen. And so dissociative seizures,&nbsp;&nbsp; they resemble um they don't they sometimes can&nbsp; resemble epileptic seizures, but not always. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and a lot of the the um symptomology surrounding&nbsp; them is is freezing and an inability to articulate&nbsp;&nbsp; outwardly the the pain and the torment um that&nbsp; is happening inside the body that is causing this&nbsp;&nbsp; seizing, this freezing up. Uh the brain will run&nbsp; on a loop like a broken record. Um and so I had,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, years where this would happen and I&nbsp; would literally be beating my head against a wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; literally beating my head against a wall trying&nbsp; to get my brain to work, my body to work, just&nbsp;&nbsp; so that I could easily move my limbs to get to a&nbsp; bathroom or to go get a drink of water. I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; through through several years of this and it's&nbsp; getting worse and worse and worse and worse and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh nobody seemed to really care or mind. Um, and&nbsp; that's because I realize now they were all a part&nbsp;&nbsp; of this, um, this cult of mind control. And I&nbsp; went through the specifics of of these cults,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, in the last interview. And so, um, I was going&nbsp; through loss of consciousness. I was going through&nbsp;&nbsp; transances, stupers, um amnesia, hyperot seizures,&nbsp; um sometimes muscle stiffness, sometimes tremors,&nbsp;&nbsp; uh a lot of twitching of the muscles. Um and so&nbsp; they are now in the current diagnostic manual of&nbsp;&nbsp; the DSM, uh whatever we think about that, um&nbsp; considered a manifestation of a dissociative,&nbsp;&nbsp; um or conversion disorder. And so they're&nbsp; not actually under the patient's voluntary&nbsp;&nbsp; control and they're, you know, they're thought to&nbsp; represent, you know, the patient, as we might say,&nbsp;&nbsp; to represent their the response to emotional&nbsp; stress. And so basically what had happened&nbsp;&nbsp; is that my programming began to break down as I&nbsp; began to resist the demands of the cult as well&nbsp;&nbsp; as the programs that were installed inside of me.&nbsp; Because when I got a hold of the truth through&nbsp;&nbsp; through Yah's word, through his written word,&nbsp; um that awoke a war from the realm of darkness,&nbsp;&nbsp; from covenants that I had made, that parts of&nbsp; me had made that I didn't know that I had had&nbsp;&nbsp; that personalities had made under duress from the&nbsp; cult under satanic ritual abuse, blood covenants,&nbsp;&nbsp; um oaths that were made uh both under duress&nbsp; and also uh voluntarily. early. And so, um,&nbsp;&nbsp; as I began to go through this process of renewing&nbsp; my mind with his word, because his word is sharp,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's powerful, as a as a two-edged sword, able&nbsp; to divide bone from marrow, the thoughts from&nbsp;&nbsp; the intents of the heart. I went through this&nbsp; soul surgery, and it was shattering, heartending,&nbsp;&nbsp; painful, excruciating. Um, and it led to a nervous&nbsp; breakdown. Uh, because as memories began to&nbsp;&nbsp; surface, because this is what happens when we pick&nbsp; up his word and his light shines in the darkness,&nbsp;&nbsp; uh, the darkness is revealed. And so&nbsp; those who were around me that were&nbsp;&nbsp; uh a couple handlers um and my head programmer um&nbsp; began to crack down on um measures of torture to&nbsp;&nbsp; uh create ultimately a psychotic break that&nbsp; would land me in the hospital. So then I have&nbsp;&nbsp; that on my record now as a uh you know psych ward&nbsp; patient or somebody who is me mentally ill. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; this is what happened. Um, I was in my home. Uh, a&nbsp; friend had found me basically walking into walls,&nbsp;&nbsp; not able to function. Um, and crying out for&nbsp; help because, uh, my children were home and I&nbsp;&nbsp; was unable to find somebody to come over and help&nbsp; me function, including my husband was completely&nbsp;&nbsp; ignoring me. Um there was a a moment where I&nbsp; pleaded that for to him for help not to go to work&nbsp;&nbsp; because I was unable to care for the children.&nbsp; And he just smiled and he said, "I know." And&nbsp;&nbsp; he walked out the door and I went, "Wow, I am&nbsp; dealing with with a darker psychopathy uh than I&nbsp;&nbsp; realized." But that was incredibly validating. So,&nbsp; long story short, and I go we went through some&nbsp;&nbsp; of these details. Um, uh, my friend had called&nbsp; the police to help me exit the house safely, get&nbsp;&nbsp; away from the night, get away for the night. Um,&nbsp; but, uh, my husband had intercepted and charmed&nbsp;&nbsp; them and convinced them that I needed to be&nbsp; medicated and taken to the psych ward. And so, um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I complied. Um and while I was there um they were&nbsp; unable to find anything wrong with me. Um and so&nbsp;&nbsp; um after you know 6 days they had told me to that&nbsp; I could check myself out um anytime. My experience&nbsp;&nbsp; there was really hard um but um it was really&nbsp; interesting. Uh, it was a really interesting&nbsp;&nbsp; way that I was set free because one of the things&nbsp; that my programmer did when I was young was put me&nbsp;&nbsp; in a straight jacket in a simulated psych wart&nbsp; situation to abuse and terrify me um of being&nbsp;&nbsp; in such a circumstance. In the event that I ever&nbsp; began to share some of my memories in the began&nbsp;&nbsp; that I ever in the event that I began to remember&nbsp; the truth then I would be um sent to the psych&nbsp;&nbsp; ward. So he actually broke off the fear of the&nbsp; psych ward. Um God did he broke off the fear of&nbsp;&nbsp; that through the my experience in the psychward.&nbsp; Now I I believe there are a lot of horrible things&nbsp;&nbsp; that happen in these types of institutions to&nbsp; people but that was not my experience. I was I was&nbsp;&nbsp; really protected by uh my heavenly father by Aba&nbsp; um by Yah and um and while I was there um I was&nbsp;&nbsp; actually uh given the opportunity um to help the&nbsp; staff members which was kind of neat. Um, and um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and uh, cuz they, you know, they I was I didn't&nbsp; really want to be sitting still in my bed. I I&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't really want to participate too much in in&nbsp; in some of the activities that they had going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and so um and this is just by the grace of&nbsp; God alone um I was able to you know be a hand&nbsp;&nbsp; on deck to calm some patients down um that were&nbsp; um flying out of control. Um, and part of this is&nbsp;&nbsp; because I understand programming and a lot of pe&nbsp; a lot of the people that were in the psych board&nbsp;&nbsp; um were simply um not mentally ill but victims&nbsp; of uh organized abuse. And so I I um having gone&nbsp;&nbsp; through this with a programmer, having had learned&nbsp; to do some programming, was able to use some keys&nbsp;&nbsp; in order to help create a more calm, a more safe&nbsp; atmosphere in the psych ward so that some of the&nbsp;&nbsp; patients that were in the sort of higher security&nbsp; uh side of the psych ward were actually able to&nbsp;&nbsp; come and participate with some of the groups&nbsp; group staff. So, as as traumatic as it was,&nbsp;&nbsp; I was kind of in awe and amused at what God&nbsp; was doing in there. And he actually he showed&nbsp;&nbsp; me and validated for me that a lot of what are&nbsp; um perceived as mental illnesses are actually&nbsp;&nbsp; um um consequences that are installed in mind&nbsp; control programming and procedures for people who&nbsp;&nbsp; are trying to heal, who are trying to get help. If&nbsp; you start to remember these programs kick in, they&nbsp;&nbsp; cause hallucinations. They cause the hearing of&nbsp; voices. Um there are parts um you know the whole&nbsp;&nbsp; purpose of DID is to keep a person um from knowing&nbsp; that that they have it right. So if it's in an&nbsp;&nbsp; organized abuse setting, did is created to create&nbsp; the ultimate mind control slave, the ultimate spy,&nbsp;&nbsp; the ultimate assassin, whatever it is that doesn't&nbsp; know that they have these parts inside of them&nbsp;&nbsp; that programmers can bring out by uh certain codes&nbsp; or maybe if they're a sex slave of some sort,&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody can buy your code. They can invite you&nbsp; uh under false pretenses to an event. They'll use&nbsp;&nbsp; the code that they purchased from your programmer&nbsp; wherever your program has been cataloged and then&nbsp;&nbsp; that part that has been programmed to submit to&nbsp; the abuse to perform a task um or to tolerate it&nbsp;&nbsp; or to take that you know comes out and then goes&nbsp; back in after and it's it's not remembered. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, a lot of this stuff I was able to kind of&nbsp; practice and test, oddly enough, as a patient in&nbsp;&nbsp; the psych ward. Um, so I I left the psych ward um,&nbsp; having no diagnosis. Um, I was able to function&nbsp;&nbsp; a little bit better just having had the rest and&nbsp; space from my handler while I was in there. When&nbsp;&nbsp; I got out, I was taken back to my programmer's&nbsp; home uh for six months to stay and recuperate. I&nbsp;&nbsp; said to my handler, and I have to be careful about&nbsp; disclosing specifics of relationships right now,&nbsp;&nbsp; but this will all come forth very soon in&nbsp; technical detail in an affidavit as well&nbsp;&nbsp; as a book. Um, and so we'll talk a little bit&nbsp; about that in a bit, but I begged and I pleaded&nbsp;&nbsp; and I said, "Do not take me, please. That is too&nbsp; far away from my children. I want to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp; see them. I'm not dangerous. I'm not delusional.&nbsp; I'm just really sick and I'm having intermittent&nbsp;&nbsp; amnesia and memory memory floods." So, I begged&nbsp; this person to drop me off at my church because&nbsp;&nbsp; I had read in scripture that if one is sick, you&nbsp; can go to the elders of the church. They'll anoint&nbsp;&nbsp; you with oil. They'll pray for you. If you have&nbsp; any sins, you can confess them and be forgiven&nbsp;&nbsp; um by God, and then that sick person will be&nbsp; made well. And so, I like to do things by the&nbsp;&nbsp; book. I'm I'm a believer. I'm a faithful believer&nbsp; in the word of Yah. So, this person took me to the&nbsp;&nbsp; pastor's office and sat in with me during the&nbsp; meeting. Um, and um I I said to the pastor, um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm really sick. Uh, I believe I'm being abused.&nbsp; Um, I tried to uh take escape for a night with&nbsp;&nbsp; my children to a friend's house and um um Oh,&nbsp; sorry. This is really hard. this is the most&nbsp;&nbsp; the children is the thing with the children is the&nbsp; most dramatic understand. And they said well they&nbsp;&nbsp; said well tell me about the abuse what's going&nbsp; on and I said I don't know I don't remember and&nbsp;&nbsp; I began to cry and I I was just in despair. I kept&nbsp; saying I don't remember. I don't remember. I just&nbsp;&nbsp; know I do not trust this person. Right. Um I do&nbsp; not trust this person and I don't know what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and so the pastor, you know, prayed for&nbsp; me, but I begged. I said, "Can you please,&nbsp;&nbsp; is there somewhere somehow in the church, is&nbsp; there somebody that I can talk to, somebody who&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe has been through an abusive situation who&nbsp; could pray with me on a regular basis?" Like, I&nbsp;&nbsp; was just so alone. I needed somebody or something.&nbsp; And um this this pastor um um as it turned out um&nbsp;&nbsp; had been already contacted by my programmer where&nbsp; I was supposed to be and they had decided that no&nbsp;&nbsp; matter what he I was to be encouraged to go back&nbsp; to this place for six months to recuperate and&nbsp;&nbsp; be reprogrammed. and I begged and I pleaded and I&nbsp; said, "Please, I can't go back to the place that&nbsp;&nbsp; I got sick." So, I went there. There was there&nbsp; was nowhere else for me to go. While I was there, um I just fasted and I prayed and I just I just&nbsp; made um a a wall um where I wrote down all of the&nbsp;&nbsp; sins of the the family that I grew up in of of&nbsp; this cult. every sin that I could think of that&nbsp;&nbsp; had been committed in this cult, I wrote on the&nbsp; wall and I fasted and I prayed and based on um&nbsp;&nbsp; inspiration from from Gideon in Judges 5 to7 where&nbsp; he burned down his alt his father's altar to Baal,&nbsp;&nbsp; I just did this and I knew this looks crazy. I'm&nbsp; just fresh out of the psychord. If somebody comes&nbsp;&nbsp; in and they see a wall of sins, uh, everything&nbsp; from gluttony to pedophilia to it was all there.&nbsp;&nbsp; um if they see this, it's going to look crazy.&nbsp; But I didn't care at this point because I knew&nbsp;&nbsp; that I was sharing things that would cause me to&nbsp; be accused as crazy on the veneer personalities of&nbsp;&nbsp; these people. But I knew that their personalities&nbsp; underneath were hearing the message. Whether they&nbsp;&nbsp; were aware of those personalities or not, I don't&nbsp; think they are. Of course, they can't couldn't be.&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew they were hearing the message and that&nbsp; some would retaliate uh vindictively and try to&nbsp;&nbsp; hunt and bury me, but that others would hear the&nbsp; message of hope and see the doorway to freedom&nbsp;&nbsp; and would come and leave this cult eventually.&nbsp; And so I sat there and I fasted and I prayed for&nbsp;&nbsp; days. Um, and I just asked for Abba to come and&nbsp; have mercy, to come and have grace, to come and&nbsp;&nbsp; break down these altars and these covenants that&nbsp; have been made in my family going back, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 generations. And uh through this process&nbsp; uh curses began to lift off me and there was&nbsp;&nbsp; some measure of healing that began to take place&nbsp; not necessarily yet in my physical body but in my&nbsp;&nbsp; um in my mind. Um anxiety began to lift.&nbsp; I began to sleep a little better. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um um as I went through this process um of trying&nbsp; to navigate this this mind control labyrinth and&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to escape it biblically in the in the&nbsp; the location of captivity. I started to notice&nbsp;&nbsp; uh a a change happen in my captors where as I was&nbsp; afraid of my programmer of my whole life, I began&nbsp;&nbsp; to notice there was this shift and he no longer&nbsp; was able to be in the same room as me. I would&nbsp;&nbsp; come into the room and he would scurry out. uh he&nbsp; would not look me in the eyes and I was being very&nbsp;&nbsp; very I was being very much my usual loving um kind&nbsp; self um and and and not bringing forward a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; the things that I was I was wrestling with. Um but&nbsp; I noticed that there was just a tremendous change.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so as I was there for this 6 months um this&nbsp; person uh began to be afraid of me for the first&nbsp;&nbsp; time and that was very obvious and that's the&nbsp; power of the Holy Spirit. That's the power of&nbsp;&nbsp; the light. That's the power of the truth. I was&nbsp; in there now. I had come in on my authority as a&nbsp;&nbsp; priest of the most high Yaheemed by the blood&nbsp; of the lamb and his righteousness, not mine.&nbsp;&nbsp; um through faith that power then came and began&nbsp; to break veils off of me, break curses off of me,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I began to walk in confidence and in authority&nbsp; that all of this has been conquered and can be&nbsp;&nbsp; conquered through the word and through Christ&nbsp; and without even having to engage in this type&nbsp;&nbsp; of dialogue with my handler and my programmer&nbsp; at this location. the physical the the spiritual&nbsp;&nbsp; atmosphere began to change and I could tell&nbsp; that they were afraid of me. And this was proven&nbsp;&nbsp; uh because my programmer um threatened me one day&nbsp; while I was staying there. Um, and he threatened&nbsp;&nbsp; me to be quiet because he could see I was no&nbsp; longer afraid of him and he was getting afraid&nbsp;&nbsp; that I was going to start to speak what he knew&nbsp; he had done to me. And I'd never accused him. I&nbsp;&nbsp; had never told him I remembered. And uh he came&nbsp; to me in the backyard and he said to me that&nbsp;&nbsp; uh with his eyes spinning honestly like a sorcerer&nbsp; uh he said to be quiet and he used a programming&nbsp;&nbsp; code that didn't work anymore. Uh I was initiated&nbsp; in a Masonic lodge under a virtue called quiet&nbsp;&nbsp; strength and that was used to keep me quiet. um in&nbsp; the uh Masonic order. And uh so he kept repeating&nbsp;&nbsp; to me quiet strength and I I kept kind of shruging&nbsp; him off pretending. I wasn't really sure what he&nbsp;&nbsp; was talking about, but I knew. Then he snapped&nbsp; his fingers, which is another which was another&nbsp;&nbsp; uh programming trigger that he had used so that I&nbsp; would make eye contact with him. And he got in my&nbsp;&nbsp; face and he said again, "Quiet strength." and&nbsp; he repeated my name, my my name that was used&nbsp;&nbsp; in the programming and for once I didn't&nbsp; switch and I remained as I am in my new&nbsp;&nbsp; identity in Christ and I just looked him in the&nbsp; eyes with sadness and I kissed him on the forehead&nbsp;&nbsp; and I went for a walk and I praised I just praised&nbsp; Yah on that trail and I just thanked him because I&nbsp;&nbsp; knew in that moment that the curse in my family&nbsp; had finally been broken and that it was only&nbsp;&nbsp; a matter of time for the manifestation of this&nbsp; exodus to take place. And so I'm the first one&nbsp;&nbsp; out. I know there's going to be more to follow.&nbsp; Um, I know some of the promises that Yahw has made&nbsp;&nbsp; to me and I saw the power of the programming&nbsp; break down by his word and his love um, and&nbsp;&nbsp; the gospel alone in that experience. And so I'm&nbsp; very confident that he is going to do the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just have to in just pick up my cross and keep&nbsp; following him and just endure the persecution,&nbsp;&nbsp; the slander, the bearing of false witness, the&nbsp; twisting of different things and also the shame of&nbsp;&nbsp; some things that um are true. Um, and so that's&nbsp; something that I'm continuing to sort of walk&nbsp;&nbsp; through is the the the the giving up of that fear&nbsp; of man, the giving up of that shame to Christ and&nbsp;&nbsp; walking in basically my new identity, my new name&nbsp; in him. And this is exactly the the purpose for&nbsp;&nbsp; which God gave his son for us in order to redeem&nbsp; us from this kind of thing. Because we think that,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, sin, you know, in the Christian church,&nbsp; sin is often just referred to as, oh, don't have&nbsp;&nbsp; sex before marriage or or don't, you know, swear&nbsp; or don't this, don't that, you know, don't don't&nbsp;&nbsp; be intoxicated. But according to scripture, the&nbsp; eventual uh digression or denigration of of sin,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is simply um lawlessness, simply breaking&nbsp; the law of Yahw is eventual denigration into&nbsp;&nbsp; human sacrifice. The reprobate mind of Romans 1.&nbsp; it without without a compass and without a light.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can see through his word that um sin eventually&nbsp; rolls downhill into the depths of this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; satanic ritual abuse and this kind of depravity&nbsp; because these are this this these are the spirits&nbsp;&nbsp; that are at work. This is the dark the dark power&nbsp; that is at work. They need blood. They need human&nbsp;&nbsp; sacrifice. They need perversion. They need these&nbsp; kinds of energies from people in order for them to&nbsp;&nbsp; accomplish, you know, the the agenda of the fallen&nbsp; ones that we read about in Genesis. So, none of&nbsp;&nbsp; this is actually new. It's far more common than&nbsp; anyone knows. It's not a conspiracy theory. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's all throughout scripture. It's all throughout&nbsp; the ancient texts um including Enoch and Josher&nbsp;&nbsp; um and the book of wisdom. I mean it's just&nbsp; everywhere. But there is you know there is hope&nbsp;&nbsp; and I saw his power come through in that situation&nbsp; and restore me to a sound mind. Um and that&nbsp;&nbsp; was really beautiful. But after the psych ward&nbsp; experience and after the the six months um spent&nbsp;&nbsp; at my original reprogram sorry with my original&nbsp; programmer to reprogram me after the psych ward.&nbsp;&nbsp; So that so that happened um in order to reprogram&nbsp; me and it didn't work because the power of God was&nbsp;&nbsp; was greater. After that, I returned back home to&nbsp; be with my children. And I was healthier and freer&nbsp;&nbsp; than I had ever been. And I and I during this time&nbsp; had been calling um women's shelters because I was&nbsp;&nbsp; so desperate to flee. I was so desperate to get&nbsp; away. Um but y'all kept just kept saying, "Rain,&nbsp;&nbsp; remain, remain. I have work for you to do to do&nbsp; here." Um, and he had asked me if I was willing,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I was. And um, and so I I didn't go to the&nbsp; women's shelters. I ended up um, moving back home&nbsp;&nbsp; into the house with my children until the day&nbsp; that I was dumped off out of the country with&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing but a an extra outfit besides the clothes&nbsp; on my back and no warning. Financially cut off.&nbsp;&nbsp; um homeless effectively um with nothing told that&nbsp; my delusions my and my memories were false. Um my&nbsp;&nbsp; husband had said he was going to file for divorce.&nbsp; The divorce papers came through a process server.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and they were not divorce papers. They were a&nbsp; protective order to forbid me from returning home&nbsp;&nbsp; to retrieve any of my belongings or come within a&nbsp; thousand ft of my children. Uh, and this is how we&nbsp;&nbsp; know the judicial system is corrupt because like&nbsp; the police were sent, a process server was sent&nbsp;&nbsp; with all these different types of things and and&nbsp; the the the due process was different than what is&nbsp;&nbsp; actually typical. Um, and so we know, right, that&nbsp; they have they have people positioned in all of&nbsp;&nbsp; these different places. And anyone that is in the&nbsp; cult has relationships with law enforcement. They&nbsp;&nbsp; have relationships with judges, with lawyers. It's&nbsp; not hard to do. And so, um, because I was so sick,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, I did not dispute the protective order, um,&nbsp; because I was unable. I realized at this point to&nbsp;&nbsp; safely return and be anywhere near my abusers.&nbsp; I couldn't heal if I was anywhere around them&nbsp;&nbsp; at this point. And this was now a time for me to&nbsp; pursue healing so that I could be healthy for my&nbsp;&nbsp; children so that I could fight for them so that&nbsp; uh I they will be restored for me to me. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; um I was eventually granted uh a visitation right&nbsp; over the phone because I'm, you know, 5 hours away&nbsp;&nbsp; from them in a different country um in Canada.&nbsp; Um my children are in Washington and they do&nbsp;&nbsp; this intentionally, right? They they have people&nbsp; they you know they select your spouse for you and&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a lot of uh this is really common across&nbsp; the border because in the event that somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; begins to defy the cult um they can uh create a&nbsp; tremendous legal hassle by putting them across&nbsp;&nbsp; the border um where it's difficult to really um to&nbsp; really access any services or access any funds. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; like for example um I can't yeah there's there's&nbsp; just a whole rigomeal of reasons I can't can't&nbsp;&nbsp; even get on disability in order to get financial&nbsp; help or anything like that. Um so it's kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; a nightmare. So I was I was kind of launched I&nbsp; was catapulted out of the country. I was given&nbsp;&nbsp; uh half an hour on Tuesdays to talk to both of my&nbsp; children together on the phone. under supervision. And I did that three times. And um my children&nbsp; were being so closely coerced and handled during&nbsp;&nbsp; our conversations, what I was allowed to&nbsp; say or talk about, what they were allowed&nbsp;&nbsp; to say or talk about that by the third visit,&nbsp; and it's like you're just like it's I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; how stressful is that? You have half an hour once&nbsp; a week on the phone just to see your kids. They do&nbsp;&nbsp; this just to torture mothers. It's just to torture&nbsp; mothers. And my son actually had to lie down. He&nbsp;&nbsp; got sick. Um because I had said to them, "Do you&nbsp; understand where I went? I I would like to know&nbsp;&nbsp; what you were told." Because I wasn't even given&nbsp; the opportunity to say goodbye. I was just dumped&nbsp;&nbsp; off somewhere. Um I said, I you know, it's not&nbsp; my choice to be here. I wanted them to know that&nbsp;&nbsp; I I did not leave them, that I was removed and I&nbsp; was legally being prevented from returning home&nbsp;&nbsp; to see them. And like I just I wanted to have&nbsp; a conversation with him about it and it wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp; even on the table. Um he was hauled out of the&nbsp; room, came back in, said he wasn't allowed to&nbsp;&nbsp; talk about it. Then he got dizzy and had to lay&nbsp; down. This was my nine-year-old who's nine or&nbsp;&nbsp; um a 10 at this at this time. And so after that&nbsp; third time, um I sent a message to my husband&nbsp;&nbsp; and I said, "I am not agreeing to this anymore.&nbsp; I will speak I will visit with my children. I&nbsp;&nbsp; will speak with my children on my terms or not at&nbsp; all. This is inhumane and this is abusive." And&nbsp;&nbsp; um and so um it's been about a year now, almost&nbsp; a year now, and I have not had any contact with&nbsp;&nbsp; them physically or over the phone. I'm not I'm&nbsp; struggling um today um to articulate this in a way&nbsp;&nbsp; that isn't in a a a you know in a way that is um&nbsp; linear um and makes a lot of sense because it is&nbsp;&nbsp; such a grief to me to not have access to them to&nbsp; not be have even been able to have a conversation&nbsp;&nbsp; about with them about where I am or why or what&nbsp; has happened. It is so cruel and so demented the&nbsp;&nbsp; way that I have been treated. Um, and I can't just&nbsp; the trauma. Um, it's just a hard thing to talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about. So, that's why I'm kind of bouncing all&nbsp; over the place. And, and because I have I'm split,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, I have a lot of parts. I have a lot of&nbsp; different things to say. And so, I interrupt&nbsp;&nbsp; myself a lot. And so I just really appreciate&nbsp; the grace of of you who are listening. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I hope you can kind of understand and kind of&nbsp; follow and I I hope there's something um there's&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody out there who who will feel less alone&nbsp; through you know just hearing this experience. But&nbsp;&nbsp; um you know I asked I I had I had requested&nbsp; could I at least get some drawings. My oldest&nbsp;&nbsp; son especially is a just an phenomenal artist. Um&nbsp; that was something really special that we used to&nbsp;&nbsp; do together and we used to bond together over&nbsp; um I was not sent uh anything. Um absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing. No Mother's Day message, no no Mother's&nbsp; Day messages, no drawings, um no um just nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just completely cut off. I wasn't even allowed to&nbsp; mail a gift to their house for their birthdays.&nbsp;&nbsp; um still have no idea what it is that they&nbsp; have been told. Um but I am not mentally&nbsp;&nbsp; ill. Dissociative disorder is a mechanism for&nbsp; survival. It's not a mental illness. Um and I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; angry. I am incredibly angry. But this time, as&nbsp; excruciating as it has been, has afforded me to&nbsp;&nbsp; apply the strategy that I've gotten from the Lord.&nbsp; Um, and it's taken a lot of faith and a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; patience. Not to show all my cards right now. Um,&nbsp; but um, I have to say, Yah is so brilliant and he&nbsp;&nbsp; is so wise. Um, and so I am just clinging to him&nbsp; through faith that he has promised me that what he&nbsp;&nbsp; has been leading me to do during this time is is&nbsp; working. It's going to work. It is such a biblical&nbsp;&nbsp; thing that the enemy ins snares himself in his own&nbsp; traps. He falls in his own pit. He's ins snared by&nbsp;&nbsp; his own devices, his own craftiness, and his own&nbsp; words. Um, and so I'm just clinging in faith, um,&nbsp;&nbsp; as I'm watching this unfold in absolute awe, um,&nbsp; that I am going to be restored with my children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and um, and um, everything that has been done&nbsp; in darkness is going to be exposed and they will&nbsp;&nbsp; know exact they will know the truth. Um, and so&nbsp; that's where I'm at right now pertaining to that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your convictions are so powerful. I get chills&nbsp; whenever I listen to you speak because you really&nbsp;&nbsp; do it from your heart and in such a genuine and&nbsp; authentic way. And you actually didn't skip around&nbsp;&nbsp; at all in my opinion. I thought everything really&nbsp; flowed well. How you were able to explain all of&nbsp;&nbsp; that and how it connected. And I mean just to&nbsp; unpack some of it, you know, this is so common&nbsp;&nbsp; within our community and it's so something that&nbsp; is so shielded from the public on how a survivor&nbsp;&nbsp; is treated after they start to display whether&nbsp; it's physical memories or body memories or you&nbsp;&nbsp; know what could be labeled as a psychosis. Um&nbsp; which is so ridiculous that um survivors could&nbsp;&nbsp; be penalized for that. Of course, if you remember&nbsp; the things that you and others have went through,&nbsp;&nbsp; who wouldn't go into a psychosis? Remembering&nbsp; those things, I mean, just hearing about it&nbsp;&nbsp; could put somebody in a really hard mental state&nbsp; if they they've never heard of some of these uh&nbsp;&nbsp; types of abuses that, you know, children like you&nbsp; had to endure and survive. horrific, you know, but&nbsp;&nbsp; just seeing these playbooks happen over and over&nbsp; and over again and that they happen and they do it&nbsp;&nbsp; in such a strategic way where you hear your story&nbsp; and you see how you're going through life thinking&nbsp;&nbsp; that that the events happening, the people that&nbsp; you're meeting that it's all organic, that there's&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing really coincidental, that this is a path&nbsp; that you chose for yourself, a partner that you&nbsp;&nbsp; chose for yourself, a decision that you made for&nbsp; yourself, and then having to realize looking back&nbsp;&nbsp; that these people were 10 steps ahead of you had&nbsp; planned a way for all of these events to occur for&nbsp;&nbsp; you knowing that the fate would be as soon as she&nbsp; starts remembering. We know she's going to and as&nbsp;&nbsp; soon as she starts um recalling we know exactly&nbsp; what we're going to do. We have all the pieces in&nbsp;&nbsp; place. We have we know what church she might go&nbsp; to. We know what friend might might comfort her.&nbsp;&nbsp; We know her husband is under our control. we know&nbsp; exactly what we're going to tell the children and&nbsp;&nbsp; we know her uh all the resources that she has and&nbsp; we're going to take them away. I mean, it is just&nbsp;&nbsp; mindblowing how strategic this Darvo is. this this&nbsp; abuse after abuse is and how how long in advance&nbsp;&nbsp; they're able to sort of conduct this path to where&nbsp; it can completely sidetrack you to where it's only&nbsp;&nbsp; after the fact you and so many others can say,&nbsp; "Oh my gosh, I I see now exactly how this was all&nbsp;&nbsp; orchestrated, but they made it feel so organic and&nbsp; so natural that that I was choosing all of this,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and and it's just really horrible.&nbsp; how we're treated, you know, you look at how&nbsp;&nbsp; like a military vet is treated after a war, you&nbsp; know, and all the empathy that that society has&nbsp;&nbsp; for them and how of course there's flaws in that&nbsp; system, too. You know, there's it's definitely not&nbsp;&nbsp; a perfect healing system, but at least society&nbsp; has empathy for that. When a soldier starts&nbsp;&nbsp; sharing that they experienced a lot of really hard&nbsp; things um while in war or while in the military,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, we really accept that as oh my&nbsp; gosh, that's so heartbreaking. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we can't even imagine. But when a survivor comes&nbsp; forward and and says the same types of things that&nbsp;&nbsp; are extremely traumatic and that can literally&nbsp; put somebody into a a state of psychosis or&nbsp;&nbsp; um you know worse because of what they went&nbsp; through. You know, it's really horrible that&nbsp;&nbsp; these families get away with helping orchestrate&nbsp; sort of the perfect cover up of of the abuse&nbsp;&nbsp; that they incurred on the survivor. And so, right&nbsp; from going to a psych ward to knowing, all right,&nbsp;&nbsp; that's on her record. The second she tries to to&nbsp; get the kids or the second that she starts to,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, move away from the family and possibly&nbsp; takes the kids, we have this right on her record&nbsp;&nbsp; that we can go to the courts and use against her&nbsp; and it's going to be in our favor and she doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp; even know it, you know. And it's just so malicious&nbsp; and so sinister how every detail is so carefully&nbsp;&nbsp; orchestrated and that they're literally, you know,&nbsp; seeing years into the future and they're so scared&nbsp;&nbsp; of their secrets getting out that they literally&nbsp; have like a fail safe for every single possible&nbsp;&nbsp; scenario that could possibly happen to where you&nbsp; might share, you know, and and looking at a story&nbsp;&nbsp; like yours, it's just like it leaves your jaw on&nbsp; the floor seeing how many people were involved in&nbsp;&nbsp; orchestrating this and you know how in your mind&nbsp; these were people that should have loved you,&nbsp;&nbsp; should have cared about you, should have wanted&nbsp; you uh to heal and and should have been there&nbsp;&nbsp; supporting you in your time of need. Especially&nbsp; hearing about your husband just leaving whenever&nbsp;&nbsp; you're in despair asking him for help as a parent,&nbsp; you know, and and hearing just the the psychotic&nbsp;&nbsp; nature of his response, you know, you look at&nbsp; all of this and then them contacting a priest&nbsp;&nbsp; before you even get there and having that all&nbsp; planned out in advance, you know, so you you're&nbsp;&nbsp; you can't even go to a place like a church, which&nbsp; should be a safe haven for survivors and get help.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so it's just it's so devastating hearing this&nbsp; and I am so so sorry that they targeted you this&nbsp;&nbsp; way and orchestrated the removal of your children&nbsp; because you are one of the most loving amazing&nbsp;&nbsp; mothers in the whole world. And all I can say is&nbsp; that these people picked the mom the wrong mom to&nbsp;&nbsp; mess with and your children picked the right mom.&nbsp; Your children are so lucky that they have a mother&nbsp;&nbsp; who's going to understand what they went through&nbsp; whenever they get out. Um, they're so lucky that&nbsp;&nbsp; they have a mother who's willing to literally&nbsp; put her life on the line to fight for them. And&nbsp;&nbsp; they're so lucky that they have such a loving,&nbsp; amazing mother on the other side of this who&nbsp;&nbsp; is going to embrace them when they too have the&nbsp; freedom to be able to leave and to be in your arms&nbsp;&nbsp; again. And I just ask everybody that they pray for&nbsp; this, that they pray over you and your family and&nbsp;&nbsp; your children, that not only this gets exposed,&nbsp; but that you get reunited with your children as&nbsp;&nbsp; soon as possible and they can escape the way that&nbsp; you did and not be in the the the strongholds of&nbsp;&nbsp; evil in the spirit as well as in the physical&nbsp; with their family. Amen. Thank you. And I have&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing in and of myself to be able to fight this&nbsp; entity. You know, like you like you you said,&nbsp;&nbsp; Emma, you're right. They have the the capa the web&nbsp; that they weave around um around people so that&nbsp;&nbsp; they can never escape. it goes up to the highest&nbsp; levels um of of even our justice even our justice&nbsp;&nbsp; system. Um and and so I take I take courage in&nbsp; the fact though they haven't picked a fight with&nbsp;&nbsp; me. They have picked a fight with the most high.&nbsp; So they have already lost. Scripture is so clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are countless references um to this&nbsp; kind of activity in scripture and scripture&nbsp;&nbsp; and against especially those who are trying to&nbsp; escape and repent and and come come back to come&nbsp;&nbsp; back to faith. Yahw totally lays them waste. He&nbsp; utterly destroys um those who will not heed his&nbsp;&nbsp; long-suffering and merciful warnings. And when&nbsp; they lay these traps and these these snares um&nbsp;&nbsp; they are the ones that end up entrapped in them.&nbsp; It's just we have to walk in faith. Um and as we&nbsp;&nbsp; do, we start to see that begin to happen. And um&nbsp; and when we react in fear, that's sort of when&nbsp;&nbsp; we become reinsslaved again. um to thinking that&nbsp; that these entities that be are are more powerful&nbsp;&nbsp; um than than the truth. And it's just it's just&nbsp; not it's just not true. And I'm already just&nbsp;&nbsp; the fact that I was able to escape and stand&nbsp; here today um and testify um and having gotten&nbsp;&nbsp; through that rambling little testimony about my&nbsp; children um without switching is a testimony to&nbsp;&nbsp; the glory of Yahw and his power because I&nbsp; could not have done that the last interview&nbsp;&nbsp; we did together. I couldn't even go there. I&nbsp; couldn't even talk talked about everything else.&nbsp;&nbsp; uh but but my children um and so he is you know he&nbsp; is bringing strength you know I found files on my&nbsp;&nbsp; own program in the documents of one of my abusers&nbsp; um and it included um oh I'm so tempted to say&nbsp;&nbsp; the name of it uh but um it's all going to come&nbsp; out um in a in a different in a different forum&nbsp;&nbsp; um but there was there was details in in the&nbsp; technology ology that was being used um uh that&nbsp;&nbsp; was being planned and some really dark stuff. And&nbsp; so um you know Yah knows how to make sloppy joe's&nbsp;&nbsp; out of the Illuminati. Um he really really does&nbsp; because you know as scripture says the fear of&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahw is the beginning of wisdom. unless you fear&nbsp; him, you're not, you know, going to have that kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of you're not going to have wisdom. And so, so I&nbsp; made some discoveries that with his help that were&nbsp;&nbsp; just far bigger than I ever could have imagined.&nbsp; And so I'm I'm working on building my testimony&nbsp;&nbsp; um with details um outside of the eyes of the&nbsp; Roman mob as we're calling it uh to be released at&nbsp;&nbsp; the right time and in the future when the impact&nbsp; will be big enough due to the inclusions uh and&nbsp;&nbsp; the completeness of it. Um I we we um withdrew&nbsp; our podcast uh on the main platform for the time&nbsp;&nbsp; being. It um because of threats being made to the&nbsp; family that was supporting me from my family of&nbsp;&nbsp; origin from the cult. There was just some nasty&nbsp; threats. Um and I don't believe any of them would&nbsp;&nbsp; prosper. Um, but you know, I began to see that&nbsp; as things came into light and I was as I was&nbsp;&nbsp; collecting evidence and as memories were returning&nbsp; that this is way bigger than just me. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and so it's actually good to uh embrace I think&nbsp; a season of hiddenness for the time being. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I do encourage uh people to subscribe to&nbsp; us at the Quickening Project um on YouTube. We&nbsp;&nbsp; are on Spotify at least for the music for now&nbsp; and then for the eventual I pray Yahw willing&nbsp;&nbsp; restoration of of the podcast because we are&nbsp; we are called to obedience to Yahw even against&nbsp;&nbsp; threats and intimidation from the enemy and to&nbsp; proclaim the truth like a city on the hill. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um and so we're just in a season regarding the&nbsp; podcast of of recalibration. Um, and so when it is&nbsp;&nbsp; eventually released, the fullness of my testimony,&nbsp; affidavit, book, and more, and other interviews&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm doing on platforms, just alone uh by myself&nbsp; cuz I have personally nothing to lose now. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; this will then totally expose the camp of the&nbsp; enemy. um they'll be um I I pray brought to&nbsp;&nbsp; their knees so that they can be granted repentance&nbsp; and forgiveness and ultimately salvation. But you&nbsp;&nbsp; know a big shock is coming and you know I've done&nbsp; my best to warn those in the cult many of which&nbsp;&nbsp; as I have said were family friends that I love&nbsp; to repent and seek the truth so they can be on&nbsp;&nbsp; the right side of this exposure when it comes. Um&nbsp; but nobody will venture into the light and they&nbsp;&nbsp; in instead continue to choose to cast shadows on&nbsp; their works in both denial and malicious intent&nbsp;&nbsp; to continue their campaign of slander and threats&nbsp; and vile actions against me against those who have&nbsp;&nbsp; helped me when I was left destitute and by effect&nbsp; uh my children. Um and so um but I do encourage&nbsp;&nbsp; you to come and enjoy the music. It's been such a&nbsp; healing mechanism. Um, we've been writing writing&nbsp;&nbsp; music and and producing it in in 444 hertz, which&nbsp; is just a really powerful healing frequency. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; that is believed to be the key of David. Um, and&nbsp; so, um, yeah, you know, there's so much I want to&nbsp;&nbsp; say. I'm chomping at the bit, but I'm I'm learning&nbsp; to grow in patience and and restraint a and wisdom&nbsp;&nbsp; and to to not um um yeah, I think there's some&nbsp; things right now that have come to light that&nbsp;&nbsp; are better built in secret to avoid, you know,&nbsp; the hassle because I know you haven't received&nbsp;&nbsp; any threats from my, you know, ex family, um&nbsp; but other podcasters and interviewers that&nbsp;&nbsp; um I have um been on have received threats of&nbsp; lawsuits and and things like that. It's all&nbsp;&nbsp; just fluff. I mean, it's not going to come&nbsp; to anything. Um but it's just it's just not&nbsp;&nbsp; worth the engagement and the harassment right&nbsp; now. Um but eventually this disclosure will be&nbsp;&nbsp; nuclear and it will bring healing to me, many&nbsp; others. I believe justice and and vindication. Wow. Oh my goodness. That is amazing that you're&nbsp; working on so much behind the scenes and that you&nbsp;&nbsp; were backed into a corner. Instead of cowering,&nbsp; you took that as a way to empower yourself. Like&nbsp;&nbsp; you said, you have nothing to lose now. They took&nbsp; everything. And so the they actually put you in a&nbsp;&nbsp; position of of power. And I really love that like&nbsp; you can recognize those moments. I especially,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, you told that um in your testimony a&nbsp; little bit earlier about the power exchange while&nbsp;&nbsp; you were at your programmer's house and seeing&nbsp; how his reaction to you went from that of that&nbsp;&nbsp; psychopathic I own her, I control her mentality&nbsp; to, oh my gosh, I do not have control over this&nbsp;&nbsp; person anymore. And I'm terrified of that. I had&nbsp; a guest on my podcast named Carrie Alah and she&nbsp;&nbsp; had said in one episode and it was so impactful.&nbsp; She was like talking about how she would feel now&nbsp;&nbsp; if she saw her abuser and on the streets and how&nbsp; she would feel and she said it's like they build&nbsp;&nbsp; a really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sharp weapon and now it's pointed&nbsp; at them, you know. And she's like that's how I&nbsp;&nbsp; would feel if I walked by my abuser. I wouldn't&nbsp; I wouldn't be scared anymore. He would be. And I&nbsp;&nbsp; was like, gosh, that's such a beautiful, you know,&nbsp; sort of taking your power back moment of of being&nbsp;&nbsp; empowered in those times when they want you to&nbsp; cower and not s uh being susceptible anymore to&nbsp;&nbsp; the fear tactics that they have employed on you&nbsp; your entire life. to be able to to step forward&nbsp;&nbsp; when you should be afraid and be fearless and&nbsp; knowing that you're putting that fear back where&nbsp;&nbsp; it belongs in their eyes and in their hearts&nbsp; and making them cower instead of it being you.&nbsp;&nbsp; And you can really hear that in your voice, you&nbsp; know, and now, I mean, it's it's a it's amazing&nbsp;&nbsp; hearing you and others speak out who are at that&nbsp; point where they're ready because, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; hearing how you describe yourself before and how&nbsp; they, you know, with all the years of of grooming&nbsp;&nbsp; and abuse and torture and programming and where&nbsp; they were able to get you to be in that point&nbsp;&nbsp; where you were more submissive, you know, and&nbsp; and to hear what's on the other side of taking&nbsp;&nbsp; that power back and in in doing that healing work&nbsp; to where you just sound so confident and powerful&nbsp;&nbsp; today and like I can't even picture you any other&nbsp; way. Like I know that this is the way that God&nbsp;&nbsp; intended you to be and to to be able to approach&nbsp; your life, you know, fearless and just incredibly&nbsp;&nbsp; courageous. That Thank you. I appreciate that.&nbsp; It's, you know, it's it's been such a grace and&nbsp;&nbsp; you're totally right. like something broke when&nbsp; I repented and pleaded for mercy and forgiveness&nbsp;&nbsp; um for the perpetrator group that day after the&nbsp; psych ward. Like I like this this looked like I&nbsp;&nbsp; don't know if you've ever seen the movie Homeland&nbsp; with Carrie like one of one she's a detective. It&nbsp;&nbsp; looked like like it was a total red string wall.&nbsp; Like it looked it would have looked to anybody&nbsp;&nbsp; that had seen it or even to myself to think, "Wow,&nbsp; what what are you doing in here?" But this this is&nbsp;&nbsp; the thing about the Holy Spirit is he he calls us&nbsp; to do things according to his word. And sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp; those things are really unconventional and they&nbsp; look ridiculous or crazy or foolish to the eyes of&nbsp;&nbsp; men. I mean, Yeshua was was was driven to the edge&nbsp; of a cliff because they were calling him crazy&nbsp;&nbsp; when he was preaching the message of the gospel um&nbsp; and uh talking about, you know, the truth. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp; we have to be kind of willing um to do things&nbsp; according to the leading of his spirit. But&nbsp;&nbsp; you're right, something broke off of me, too,&nbsp; when I began to repent for the sins of my family.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I saw the sh the power shift. I was now the&nbsp; power was now with me. And I the programming was&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer working. The trigger words were no&nbsp; longer working. I was no longer under control&nbsp;&nbsp; of my handler or programmer. And as fear began&nbsp; to grew in grow in them, the power of love and&nbsp;&nbsp; grace and mercy and a desire for justice began&nbsp; to grow in me. And sometimes people have to be&nbsp;&nbsp; brought often low to the brink of absolute poverty&nbsp; of spirit and a recognition of their own depravity&nbsp;&nbsp; and consequences in the realm of the physical&nbsp; in order to rescue them and snatch them from the&nbsp;&nbsp; flames of of hellfire that that that you know our&nbsp; sins have have incurred. Um, and so I whatever it&nbsp;&nbsp; is that Aba would have me do, I will do because&nbsp; I know he will meet me with the power to do with&nbsp;&nbsp; that to do that. And when we fear him, we don't&nbsp; fear fear man. Um, but but that broke down that&nbsp;&nbsp; broke this altar that had been in my family&nbsp; during this process of of fasting and prayer&nbsp;&nbsp; before my red string wall of sins of the cult. and&nbsp; my and somebody in my family actually had found it&nbsp;&nbsp; um in the back of the walk-in closet of the room&nbsp; that I was staying. That was kind of my my warfare&nbsp;&nbsp; and and room of room of intercession at the time.&nbsp; And asked if I was okay. And I laughed and I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I know this looks bad, especially after&nbsp; just coming out of the hospital." Um I said and&nbsp;&nbsp; and I said, "Would you like me to tell you about&nbsp; it?" And and this person said he said, "Sure."&nbsp;&nbsp; And I said, "Well, I'm repenting for the sins of&nbsp; our family." Um, and I I I don't have, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; the ability necessarily to repent for the sins&nbsp; of another, but I can bring their sins before the&nbsp;&nbsp; throne um in an offering of repentance for um I&nbsp; believe in in the heart of the lamb who, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; um who bore our sins and ask him to um stir up um&nbsp; to stir up both justice and mercy. see to to end&nbsp;&nbsp; this now. Even if I have to be the first one to&nbsp; bushwack through and get cut and bruised and and&nbsp;&nbsp; beaten, I know that that that that covenant with&nbsp; Satan was broken during that fast and it's going&nbsp;&nbsp; to come to full fruition at some point. I really&nbsp; truly believe that I'm going to see eventually&nbsp;&nbsp; um the rest of my family get saved. I do too. I&nbsp; really feel that way. And I feel like right now&nbsp;&nbsp; is kind of that tipping point, you know, where&nbsp; my hope is you and others who have been speaking&nbsp;&nbsp; out will get the recognition, you know, from the&nbsp; public as well, so they can support you in your&nbsp;&nbsp; in your missions. Cuz historically, it's been sort&nbsp; of the opposite. you know, you get called and gas&nbsp;&nbsp; lit and called crazy from your family and then you&nbsp; go to society and they they call you a conspiracy&nbsp;&nbsp; theorist for talking about this. And I feel like&nbsp; we're really pushing past the hump of those days&nbsp;&nbsp; as well where now people are starting to hear&nbsp; about this more and more and it's starting to be&nbsp;&nbsp; something that makes sense in their minds. They're&nbsp; starting to lose faith in the same authority that&nbsp;&nbsp; rules over them. What a courageous woman you are.&nbsp; You think about all these generations that this&nbsp;&nbsp; went on in your family. All these people just even&nbsp; in your own story, just the few people that you've&nbsp;&nbsp; talked about just on this podcast, all those&nbsp; people, this huge network and web of people,&nbsp;&nbsp; and not one of them ever had the courage to do&nbsp; what you did. And then you look generationally at&nbsp;&nbsp; their parents and all these people's grandparents&nbsp; and all these people's great-grandparents,&nbsp;&nbsp; all these people's children if they have them,&nbsp; or children's children. You know, you look at&nbsp;&nbsp; all the different generations that this spans. How&nbsp; many people are involved in just one testimony of&nbsp;&nbsp; one survivor and that one person in all these&nbsp; generations couldn't take the programming,&nbsp;&nbsp; couldn't comply with the control, couldn't obey&nbsp; the evil and the the spiritual direction that&nbsp;&nbsp; these cults and these families try to lead&nbsp; you into so you can carry it on to the next&nbsp;&nbsp; generation, you know. And man, what a hero you&nbsp; are. You know, it's it really is amazing getting&nbsp;&nbsp; to see that you are holding so much faith and&nbsp; that that you've come so far to where you can&nbsp;&nbsp; carry yourself with with his word and and share&nbsp; that with the with the world and lead with that&nbsp;&nbsp; in a way that that is with integrity and love and&nbsp; compassion, you know, and and the fact that you're&nbsp;&nbsp; looking for every single way to get justice, you&nbsp; know. I hope that that this gives people hope on&nbsp;&nbsp; the other side of the screen as well, hearing&nbsp; you, you know, and hearing your convictions and&nbsp;&nbsp; your positivity and your confidence, you know,&nbsp; and I know that we're all rooting for you on&nbsp;&nbsp; this side of the screen and that we all are here&nbsp; for you, you know, and and I know that whatever&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever direction God is leading you in, whatever&nbsp; strategy he is helping you concoct is going to&nbsp;&nbsp; just be dynamite, you know, and that's my hope as&nbsp; well that the people involved decide to join you,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, ultim Ultimately, there's going to&nbsp; be two groups of people. There's going to be&nbsp;&nbsp; the people who put their hands up and say, "All&nbsp; right, I was caught. I want to leave. I want&nbsp;&nbsp; to heal. I'm done with this. I've wanted&nbsp; to get out forever and didn't have a way,&nbsp;&nbsp; and now I do. And I want to be like Kadai. I want&nbsp; to be like these other survivors who who healed,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know." But there's also going to be the people&nbsp; who will fight till their last breath. They'll&nbsp;&nbsp; fight to the death to take this to the grave with&nbsp; them and want nothing to do with the healing and&nbsp;&nbsp; with with coming over to the other side, you know.&nbsp; And so we'll have to reckon with that. But these&nbsp;&nbsp; conversations, I think, help pave the way for the&nbsp; compassion because ultimately we we hope 100% of&nbsp;&nbsp; the people in these systems will want to take the&nbsp; high road and want to repent and heal, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and that we need to be there with open arms just&nbsp; like how you are when that time comes when this&nbsp;&nbsp; big exposure does happen. um that we're receiving&nbsp; people with love and compassion and and wanting&nbsp;&nbsp; wanting them to go on a healing journey, you know,&nbsp; and not not letting the emotion of how hard these&nbsp;&nbsp; things are that people like you go through affect&nbsp; us in a way that makes us violent and makes us,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, very similar to the same people that&nbsp; we're trying to expose. And you are just such a&nbsp;&nbsp; wonderful example of leading in a way that I wish&nbsp; more people heard. You know, I I really feel like&nbsp;&nbsp; survivors are going to change the world.&nbsp; If everybody could hear these testimonies,&nbsp;&nbsp; there would be a renewed faith in not just&nbsp; God, but I think just in humanity with with&nbsp;&nbsp; reclaiming our empathy, too, you know, and our&nbsp; power. And uh I just want to thank you from the&nbsp;&nbsp; bottom of my heart for demonstrating the way&nbsp; that you do because you're just it's really&nbsp;&nbsp; beautiful listening to you talk about these&nbsp; things as hard as it is. Wow. you know, in um yeah, I'm I appreciate the encouragement. Um I'm&nbsp; you know as you're speaking I'm remembering in uh&nbsp;&nbsp; 2018 when I was um a new mother and afraid for my&nbsp; children and and wanting uh freedom for them from&nbsp;&nbsp; from these generational uh just generationally&nbsp; handed down cult activity. Um I was on my face uh&nbsp;&nbsp; in prayer and um Yahw said to me, "Are you willing&nbsp; um you know and I didn't understand the full scope&nbsp;&nbsp; of what he of what was about to happen at this&nbsp; time. Um but I knew I was going to lose everything&nbsp;&nbsp; and I began to shake and tremble in fear." And so&nbsp; I want to just mention this as as we talk about&nbsp;&nbsp; courage because yes, courage is so important.&nbsp; But I shook and I trembled in in fear and I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, yeah, I am willing, but I am terrified and I&nbsp; need you to make me brave." Um, and so I just like&nbsp;&nbsp; lay on my back and I just cried in a a position&nbsp; of just surrender with my heart up and I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need you to do surgery on my heart to purge&nbsp; me of fear of man." because I just I just knew&nbsp;&nbsp; that I was going to for the next 7 to 8 years&nbsp; and and possibly longer begin to hemorrhage&nbsp;&nbsp; everything that was near and dear to me because of&nbsp; my obedience and because of the task that he had&nbsp;&nbsp; asked me to begin back then to bring um exposure.&nbsp; Um and um you know it so courage is often I think&nbsp;&nbsp; doing things scared doing it scared you know when&nbsp; Gideon was visited by the angel of the Lord and&nbsp;&nbsp; told to burn down his father's altar to Baal he&nbsp; was terrified and shaking and you know I kind you&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a funny passage in Judges 6-7 the angel finds&nbsp; him in a panic attack and and says oh mighty man&nbsp;&nbsp; of valor. And and that's just the spirit of of our&nbsp; Yah of Yahwa is he's so meek and gentle and lowly&nbsp;&nbsp; and humble as awesome and mighty and powerful&nbsp; and terrible and as fearsome as he is. He sees&nbsp;&nbsp; us. We may be doing things knock need scared and&nbsp; trembling. But when we obey faith rather than fear&nbsp;&nbsp; and we take that step even if we're terrified, he&nbsp; calls us brave. He calls us a man or a woman that&nbsp;&nbsp; is mighty and full of valor. And so I want to just&nbsp; encourage that uh for anyone who is listening who&nbsp;&nbsp; who who may feel weak um that um it's okay to feel&nbsp; the fear and to choose not to obey it and walk in&nbsp;&nbsp; faith anyway. It doesn't mean that you are not&nbsp; brave. It doesn't mean that you are not strong.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's it's actually the opposite. And um if if&nbsp; you are being led to expose um an evil or wicked&nbsp;&nbsp; scheme for the sake of setting captives free,&nbsp; um you can do that by by his power and through&nbsp;&nbsp; his word and and through faithful obedience&nbsp; and coming into a covenant um with Christ uh&nbsp;&nbsp; the way that he tells us to do it in his word.&nbsp; It's just incredibly simple. It's not easy. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it is simple. And it's actually a mercy to the&nbsp; perpetrator group to expose them. Um, it's a mercy&nbsp;&nbsp; not just to those that they have been harming or&nbsp; have harmed, but it's a mercy to them as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; um even if we're angry um so that they don't carry&nbsp; this to the grave so that Yahw may bring them low&nbsp;&nbsp; that they may repent and be saved. You know, he's&nbsp; not going to do that. He doesn't call, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and choose everybody. Um um but there's a lot of&nbsp; just there's a lot of people who will be exposed&nbsp;&nbsp; and they will still refuse to to repent. Um but&nbsp; there is no sin too grievous for uh the blood&nbsp;&nbsp; of the lamb to be able to completely wash away.&nbsp; And so we have to be willing um to obey him um no&nbsp;&nbsp; matter the cost for the sake of those we love cuz&nbsp; a lot of our perpetrators, you know, we have, you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, have split us, right? So we have parts that&nbsp; really love them. Parts that may be um working&nbsp;&nbsp; through unforgiveness, harboring bitterness and&nbsp; resentment that we have to we have to with his&nbsp;&nbsp; help um give up to him because justice is his&nbsp; and he will repay. But we do love these people,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know. We really do love these people. I'm&nbsp; not out to accuse anybody. Um, I'm just walking&nbsp;&nbsp; one step at a time according to his leading. And&nbsp; And so, um, yeah, we're going to we're going to&nbsp;&nbsp; encounter fear. We're going to be tempted to to&nbsp; to not um to not walk in courage because there's&nbsp;&nbsp; going to be warfare, right? Spiritual warfare&nbsp; um is intense. We don't fight against, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; human beings, but but powers and principalities,&nbsp; uh, not flesh and blood. And so, we really have to&nbsp;&nbsp; do this with the help of his word and the sword of&nbsp; the spirit. And there's a lot of other types of um&nbsp;&nbsp; paths that people will take uh that will seem to&nbsp; work for a while, but ultimately, you know, when&nbsp;&nbsp; we when we get to the end the end of this road, if&nbsp; we're counting on the methodologies of this world&nbsp;&nbsp; or other other, you know, uh or the um faculties&nbsp; of man, we're going to or the righteousness of&nbsp;&nbsp; ourselves, we're going to ultimately come up&nbsp; up short. And so that's the freedom of all of&nbsp;&nbsp; this is that we don't walk through this based on&nbsp; our own courage or our own righteousness at all,&nbsp;&nbsp; but on the righteousness of him who who gives his&nbsp; righteousness to us so that we can stand through&nbsp;&nbsp; this. And and you know, we chatted a little bit&nbsp; the last three days and I'm I'm going through it&nbsp;&nbsp; right now. Like you probably hear my my voice is&nbsp; different from the last few times we have spoken.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been under such uh spiritual warfare&nbsp; leading up to just this interview uh because&nbsp;&nbsp; the powers and principalities are petrified.&nbsp; And I had I had even been visited by an entity&nbsp;&nbsp; uh that identified itself as Abdon um under the&nbsp; name Abdon um uh a couple of nights ago that came&nbsp;&nbsp; into where I was sleeping the minute I lay down um&nbsp; in my bed and began to choke and strangle me and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh threaten me that if I threaten me not to&nbsp; speak. Um, and so, you know, this this stuff&nbsp;&nbsp; is real. This stuff is intense. And we're going to&nbsp; feel those dark energies. We're going to feel the&nbsp;&nbsp; fear. Um, and so we really really really really&nbsp; This is why I'm so passionate about this because&nbsp;&nbsp; if it weren't for the word of Yah, I would not&nbsp; have survived to the point of being alive right&nbsp;&nbsp; now. And there were times I didn't want to survive&nbsp; it, but I would have rather been dead than have&nbsp;&nbsp; to go through all of this. And I'm still deeply&nbsp; deeply suffering um as I'm navigating this. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; but without his word, I would not have been able&nbsp; to survive the spiritual warfare. I would not have&nbsp;&nbsp; learned the armor of of Yahw in Ephesians that&nbsp; you reference in your opening prayer often, Emma.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so there's just no other way. And regarding,&nbsp; you know, exposure, um, you know, I think about&nbsp;&nbsp; the woman at the well who was so astonished and&nbsp; bewildered by Christ when he visited her who he&nbsp;&nbsp; was drawn towards this woman in her sinful state&nbsp; and he appeared to her first and he just laid her&nbsp;&nbsp; sins before her. the sins that all the sins that&nbsp; she these sin this pattern of sin that she had had&nbsp;&nbsp; in her life and she's simply going about her life&nbsp; uh you know undoubtedly laden with the burden of&nbsp;&nbsp; her sin whether she knows it or not and and he&nbsp; comes up to her and he unpacks her sin before&nbsp;&nbsp; her without even an introduction in just the most&nbsp; bewildering way because our Messiah is so good and&nbsp;&nbsp; so loving and so merciful and he's stirred with&nbsp; compassion and good news and he didn't approach&nbsp;&nbsp; her to condemn her for it. Um but to tell her of&nbsp; her need for the living water as she's drawing&nbsp;&nbsp; water from this well for his living water which is&nbsp; his word which is themselves so that she never you&nbsp;&nbsp; know thirsts again. And my favorite part is how&nbsp; she responds. She ran back to the village to tell&nbsp;&nbsp; everyone. You know what would have happened if&nbsp; she'd been offended when Christ told her about her&nbsp;&nbsp; past when he lay her sins before her? What? She&nbsp; She could have denied it. She could have feared&nbsp;&nbsp; the light shining into her darkness before. The&nbsp; only one who could really see and know the depths&nbsp;&nbsp; of her heart and her past and everything she'd&nbsp; ever done. She could have defended herself. She&nbsp;&nbsp; could have made excuses, tried to cover up her&nbsp; shame. She could have been angry, offended. She&nbsp;&nbsp; could have run from this only water that could&nbsp; wash her sin and make her new. But she didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; choose to hide in shame because the savior came&nbsp; to take it from her with his love and with his&nbsp;&nbsp; holiness. And so that's the love of our savior and&nbsp; that's how I want to be and that's how I try to be&nbsp;&nbsp; when I am presented with conviction. Um whether&nbsp; through somebody else or if I'm confronted by his&nbsp;&nbsp; spirit or whether just through his word as I read&nbsp; it, I want to be like her. I want I don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp; reject it. I don't want to reject um reject it.&nbsp; I don't want to fall back into the bondage of&nbsp;&nbsp; scrambling to atone for myself or to hide um or&nbsp; to hide it or you know because otherwise I would&nbsp;&nbsp; carry on in the slavery of my ignorance until the&nbsp; reckoning day. And this is how I see these members&nbsp;&nbsp; of of the cult that so many of us are so livid&nbsp; with and disgusted by um but yet love at the same&nbsp;&nbsp; time because a lot of these people are family,&nbsp; spouses, people we have grown up with. Um and so&nbsp;&nbsp; um you know maybe I don't know why I'm sharing&nbsp; this. Maybe maybe there is maybe a family member&nbsp;&nbsp; is going to locate this interview. Maybe a member&nbsp; of the cult. And so this may be a message held out&nbsp;&nbsp; to these individual that we to these individuals&nbsp; that that we perish on the ground of our our own&nbsp;&nbsp; righteousness, but by his stripes were healed. And&nbsp; unless we try to mop it up and brush it under the&nbsp;&nbsp; like if we try to mop it up and brush it under the&nbsp; rug, you know, we might be white as bleach through&nbsp;&nbsp; the eyes of man, but not white as snow, not washed&nbsp; clean, completely forgiven, emancipated as if we&nbsp;&nbsp; had never sinned. And I had done a lot of horrific&nbsp; things in the cult. And um he took my shame from&nbsp;&nbsp; me through humility and through repentance.&nbsp; It's it's his loving kindness that brings us&nbsp;&nbsp; to repentance. And and so and so I just I hold&nbsp; out this this spring of water welling up with&nbsp;&nbsp; eternal life. And for anyone listening now you&nbsp; know where where the well is. Amen to that. And&nbsp;&nbsp; once again, another beautiful lesson of overcoming&nbsp; something that can be so debilitating for people,&nbsp;&nbsp; that shame and guilt. Um, I had on my podcast one&nbsp; time Harry Alah again, but she had said one of the&nbsp;&nbsp; ways she started reckoning with her own shame&nbsp; was imagining some of the the abuse situation&nbsp;&nbsp; she was forced to perpetrate in and imagining&nbsp; a police officer standing there as a witness to&nbsp;&nbsp; it without the abuser knowing. And she said if if&nbsp; that was the case and there was people there that&nbsp;&nbsp; could persecute, if they were looking at the&nbsp; situation, who would they persecute? the the&nbsp;&nbsp; child, the the young person that's forced by the&nbsp; hand of an adult to commit a crime or the adult&nbsp;&nbsp; forcing the child. And she's like, obviously&nbsp; they they wouldn't go send a child to jail if&nbsp;&nbsp; they saw an adult coercing them, whether through&nbsp; mind control or physically with their own hands,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, to per to perpetrate. You know, I think&nbsp; that's a really important part of this journey is&nbsp;&nbsp; being able to look at that through different eyes.&nbsp; you know, I can't even imagine the heaviness of of&nbsp;&nbsp; having to even look at it at all, you know,&nbsp; much less the feelings and emotions that it&nbsp;&nbsp; must bring up. But it's it's really important&nbsp; I think that you know we cross that that line&nbsp;&nbsp; at some point you know and and try to let that&nbsp; go too and and put that shame and guilt where&nbsp;&nbsp; it belongs because you know without the mind&nbsp; control without manipulation without grooming&nbsp;&nbsp; without this generational abuse happening&nbsp; if all of that didn't exist in the family&nbsp;&nbsp; nobody would have ever been put in a position to&nbsp; begin with that would involve perpetration. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's wonderful once again and hopefully that gives&nbsp; people hope on the other side of the screen who&nbsp;&nbsp; are carrying that, you know, that now might be&nbsp; the time to let that go and to really look at&nbsp;&nbsp; it through a different lens as emotional and&nbsp; painful as those moments can be. to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp; see it through different eyes and to see it in a&nbsp; way that helps represent you in your good heart,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and putting that back to where to where&nbsp; it belongs. And to to really understand that that&nbsp;&nbsp; coercion, manipulation, mind control, um amnesia&nbsp; to what you're doing, drugging, that those things,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, aren't something that that you should&nbsp; be carrying guilt for. you should be pointing&nbsp;&nbsp; the finger at somebody and saying, "Why the heck&nbsp; would you do that to a young person, to a child,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and put them in those positions and give&nbsp; them those things and do those things to them,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know. So, it's really wonderful to see that&nbsp; you've come so far in your healing journey to&nbsp;&nbsp; be able to breathe more free and to get to take&nbsp; that weight off of you, you know, and to throw it&nbsp;&nbsp; off because you can tell in your voice you sound&nbsp; very light and more at peace, you know, and even&nbsp;&nbsp; though there may still be work to do, there might&nbsp; still be a whole lifetime of work to do, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; being able to take some of that weight off even if&nbsp; it doesn't fix every single little thing can just&nbsp;&nbsp; be so tremendously important in in a journey of&nbsp; healing when there's so many different boulders on&nbsp;&nbsp; that somebody wears and carries every day. I pray&nbsp; so you know his yoke is easy and his burden is&nbsp;&nbsp; light. He says, "Come to me all who are weary and&nbsp; heavy laden and I will give you rest. I am I am&nbsp;&nbsp; gentle and lowly." And and that's how he describes&nbsp; himself and that's how he is for those who will&nbsp;&nbsp; come in humility and in need. uh for those who who&nbsp; will who firmly remain in rebellion and defiance&nbsp;&nbsp; um are going to meet are going to meet uh the side&nbsp; that is to be greatly greatly feared. Um and so I&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah I pray you know um yeah I pray so I think&nbsp; about you know I'm thinking about my oldest and&nbsp;&nbsp; and um I'm thinking about you know we see things&nbsp; in our children sometimes we see generational&nbsp;&nbsp; patterns being passed down despite our best&nbsp; efforts that can be sometimes concerning or or&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes frustrating and we think I don't want&nbsp; you to have to suffer this in this way the way&nbsp;&nbsp; that I did. And I and I remember um I had taken&nbsp; my children to the museum in Lynen, Washington&nbsp;&nbsp; um which is a tremendous occult town and um u they&nbsp; but they love the museum there and I just thought&nbsp;&nbsp; it might be an interesting educational experience.&nbsp; I had just taken them out of school to homeschool.&nbsp;&nbsp; And this was right before I was um ostracized&nbsp; and and marooned by my family. They they were&nbsp;&nbsp; so scared of my coming to a knowledge of the truth&nbsp; and my growing independence that they had to they&nbsp;&nbsp; had to put in place that protective order just to&nbsp; keep me away. The grounds of the protective order&nbsp;&nbsp; were ridiculous. There there there were no there&nbsp; were no proper grounds. my my faith and and my&nbsp;&nbsp; delusions because I'm very open and I talk about&nbsp; spiritual warfare and I do operate in in prophetic&nbsp;&nbsp; gifts. They were so terrified they had to have a&nbsp; protective order just to keep me from just to keep&nbsp;&nbsp; me away, just to keep away the light and figure&nbsp; out what the heck they were going to do. That that&nbsp;&nbsp; was what it was for. I mean, I'm not violent. I'm&nbsp; not going to hurt them. Um but they just couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; bear to have me around and they knew that they&nbsp; had lost. Otherwise, they wouldn't have done this.&nbsp;&nbsp; so they could continue to have access to me, to&nbsp; continue to exert control, to continue to keep me&nbsp;&nbsp; under their thumb, but they knew they had lost. So&nbsp; they had to they had to get me just get me as far&nbsp;&nbsp; away as possible. And so I say hallelujah to that,&nbsp; but um I suppose that was a bit of a rabbit trail,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I I was at the museum with my children and&nbsp; we came across a a Freemason exhibit about the&nbsp;&nbsp; Freemasons in town. Um, and they had their creepy,&nbsp; you know, all the creepy, it was, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp; it was w mannequins with faces, too. You know,&nbsp; those old mannequins with faces wearing the the&nbsp;&nbsp; Freemason aprons and the table with the Holy Bible&nbsp; and the dagger and some of the ritualistic items&nbsp;&nbsp; that the Masons use. And my youngest said, "Oh,&nbsp; mom, look over here." He said, "What is this?" And&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, "Oh." I said, "Yeah." He said, "Oh, it's&nbsp; creepy." And I said, "You're right. It is creepy."&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I I I gave him a very simple answer.&nbsp; I said um you know there there are people&nbsp;&nbsp; uh who Yeah. Well, I said I pointed out the Bible&nbsp; first. I said, "Yeah, you see the Bible with a&nbsp;&nbsp; dagger on it." And and he said, "Yeah, what's that&nbsp; about?" And you know, he was eight at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um he had just turned eight. And I said, "Well,&nbsp; there there are a lot of people in in the world&nbsp;&nbsp; who use the Bible." um and pretend to be, you&nbsp; know, they profess to be Christians. They say&nbsp;&nbsp; that they believe in God and they believe a lot&nbsp; of the things that are in the Bible, but they&nbsp;&nbsp; actually use it for secret um and bad purposes.&nbsp; And I just gave him a super simple explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp; And my oldest son didn't even want to look at&nbsp; the exhibit. He just wanted to keep walking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and um we were in the car after and he he was&nbsp; really quiet. Um and he's he he he brought it up&nbsp;&nbsp; um the the Masonic exhibit and and he said, "Mom,"&nbsp; he said, "we have to tell them. We have to tell&nbsp;&nbsp; them." And I just I couldn't even speak for for&nbsp; a moment. And eventually as we're driving home,&nbsp;&nbsp; this conversation's taking place. And I I just&nbsp; said, "We will. We will." And so, um, on some&nbsp;&nbsp; level, my children know, um, they know. They know&nbsp; the truth no matter what they've been told. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp; I I know that I have done my best despite my dis&nbsp; own dysfunction, despite my own guilt that has&nbsp;&nbsp; been absolved, despite um my own um inability that&nbsp; I have done my best to teach and train my children&nbsp;&nbsp; in the faith so that they will have, you know, in&nbsp; order to prepare them essentially for my eventual&nbsp;&nbsp; departure, you know, which of course has been this&nbsp; past year. And so I I do take comfort and that&nbsp;&nbsp; helps me on those grievous nights not to fall into&nbsp; despair and remember that I that as long as you&nbsp;&nbsp; know I continue to operate in faith um they will&nbsp; be protected and that part of an the inheritance&nbsp;&nbsp; um of a child of Yah is um you know restoration&nbsp; is a blessing ing upon all the generations uh that&nbsp;&nbsp; will follow. And so that's why it's really&nbsp; important for us as as mothers or or maybe&nbsp;&nbsp; fathers in some cases to to be willing to be the&nbsp; first one to say it stops here. It stops with me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and that will have a trickle down effect upon&nbsp; our children as well. He will bless them. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; I have full and total confidence as painful as it&nbsp; is and as much as I miss them every single day um&nbsp;&nbsp; that that is there's going to be such a a mighty&nbsp; reunion um at the right time and so I look forward&nbsp;&nbsp; to that. We all look forward to that. And for&nbsp; people listening, is there anything at all that&nbsp;&nbsp; people can do to support you? I know you haven't&nbsp; gone public with all of this yet. Um, I know that,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, there's still a level of anonymity that you&nbsp; are keeping to protect yourself at the moment,&nbsp;&nbsp; even though I know that that that'll change soon.&nbsp; Um, but is there anything that that people can do&nbsp;&nbsp; to support you in your quest to get your children?&nbsp; If there's anybody listening that could have a&nbsp;&nbsp; resource or anything. Thank you for asking. Um,&nbsp; I appreciate it. at this moment in time. Uh the&nbsp;&nbsp; the best way you could bless me would be to come&nbsp; and enjoy um the music that um I've been writing&nbsp;&nbsp; and producing uh with two others. Um and um you&nbsp; know if you are moved uh to extend a hand of help,&nbsp;&nbsp; you you can contact me uh on Instagram at&nbsp; thequickening or um the quickening project.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um I I don't you know I don't ask for money.&nbsp; I don't ask for anything like that. But after&nbsp;&nbsp; the last interview, somebody uh one or two people&nbsp; did reach out to ask if I had a GoFundMe that they&nbsp;&nbsp; might be able to help support the cost of living&nbsp; um you know pay for any medical bills um potential&nbsp;&nbsp; legal legal fees and that sort of thing. And so I&nbsp; do have a GoFundMe page. You could even probably&nbsp;&nbsp; Google it. Kadaya GoFundMe if you're moved. Um&nbsp; I would just be incredibly blessed. Um but you&nbsp;&nbsp; know I I really don't I don't like you know asking&nbsp; for money. Um, at this point I I am um I am um you&nbsp;&nbsp; know I'm not lacking in my basic needs that he Aba&nbsp; is providing for me um every day um you know and&nbsp;&nbsp; so I'm just kind of learning to trust um that he&nbsp; is my provider and he has been doing that through&nbsp;&nbsp; just the kindness and the generosity of others. Um&nbsp; there's just a lot of there's a lot of darkness in&nbsp;&nbsp; the world, but there's a lot of goodness, too. Um&nbsp; so yeah, thanks. I appreciate that. Um you could&nbsp;&nbsp; pray um you could pray for continued um strength,&nbsp; wisdom, uh provision. Um I you know you know it's&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting with the divorce the when my husband&nbsp; had said and I went through the conversation this&nbsp;&nbsp; conversation in the last interview that he was&nbsp; filing for divorce and uh then basically just&nbsp;&nbsp; hung up the phone and I wanted to ask if there was&nbsp; a gun to his head. Turned out not to be a divorce&nbsp;&nbsp; protective order. Divorce papers still a year&nbsp; later have not come and I would happily sign them.&nbsp;&nbsp; believe me. Um and I and um and so um um this is&nbsp; I believe for the reason of simply not wanting to&nbsp;&nbsp; divide up our assets to continue to make sure that&nbsp; I lack um but you know my you know thanks be to&nbsp;&nbsp; Yah um you know as he says if he's our shepherd&nbsp; we lack nothing and um so that turned out to be&nbsp;&nbsp; true but that's kind of a there there I'm kind of&nbsp; in a no man's land regarding that. And um I can't&nbsp;&nbsp; go into some of the reasons why I'm making the&nbsp; the the decisions legally that I'm making right&nbsp;&nbsp; now. It's all going to be explained um later&nbsp; as certain things are established. Um some of&nbsp;&nbsp; these things will seem foolish to the world and&nbsp; and the ways of man. But I have a strategy that&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been given to from from the kingdom of heaven&nbsp; um that I have to faithfully walk out and follow&nbsp;&nbsp; um until I see it come to full fruition. And and&nbsp; so far it's going really well, exactly as Yahw&nbsp;&nbsp; had said that it would. And that really moves me&nbsp; too that people went out of their way to ask you&nbsp;&nbsp; because we didn't talk about that last time. So,&nbsp; I'm really grateful that I asked today and and I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; really happy that you put together a GoFundMe and&nbsp; that you have music that people can support um in&nbsp;&nbsp; these different ways that you know people can jump&nbsp; on your journey and help you grow whether it is as&nbsp;&nbsp; an artist or in your pursuit of justice. You know,&nbsp; many of us hate asking for money or for help. But&nbsp;&nbsp; what I've come to realize is so many people have&nbsp; more than they need and want. They feel good about&nbsp;&nbsp; giving and but they're stuck with nonprofits.&nbsp; They're stuck with uh you know political campaigns&nbsp;&nbsp; like so many people are putting money places&nbsp; because it makes them feel good and it's a genuine&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to help in some way. I I work I have kids.&nbsp; I can't quit everything and jump on board but I&nbsp;&nbsp; have $5. I have $100. I have a few thousand.&nbsp; I have a job or an opportunity or I can hire&nbsp;&nbsp; them or I need their services and can pay them for&nbsp; it. You know, there's so many different ways that&nbsp;&nbsp; people just genuinely feel helpless and want to&nbsp; help. And I don't think there's any shame at all&nbsp;&nbsp; in being being somebody who can receive that, you&nbsp; know, because we want you to continue your pursuit&nbsp;&nbsp; of justice. We want all if you have to go to&nbsp; court and fight, we want you to have every single&nbsp;&nbsp; penny that you possibly need so finances aren't&nbsp; something that stops you. We want you to have&nbsp;&nbsp; support so you have a community that that you can&nbsp; lean on. We want you to have podcasts that you can&nbsp;&nbsp; go on and be able to share that aren't going to&nbsp; ostracize you or diminish your story in some way.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, we want people to support your music so&nbsp; you can eventually, if you're not already getting&nbsp;&nbsp; paid for that, you know, make that into something&nbsp; that can also be a way for you to provide for&nbsp;&nbsp; yourself. You know, so many survivors are in a&nbsp; place where it can be really destabilizing to go&nbsp;&nbsp; work a nineto-five job in a society that doesn't&nbsp; yet understand or accept them. And especially, you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, with with flashbacks or wherever somebody&nbsp; is in their journey, it can be really difficult&nbsp;&nbsp; to potentially face that whenever you're supposed&nbsp; to be in a professional environment or, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; in these different environments that just they're&nbsp; not so accepting of of somebody's pain and trauma.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so it's always my hope that we can create and&nbsp; pave ways for survivors to be able to whistleblow&nbsp;&nbsp; and to share their story and to seek justice and&nbsp; to put together campaigns and to have, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we pay people for every other job. Like what&nbsp; is more important than advocating for children,&nbsp;&nbsp; for your children, for the children of the world,&nbsp; for people in the cult to come out to educate the&nbsp;&nbsp; world on the evils that exist and that we can help&nbsp; change that and make the world a better place,&nbsp;&nbsp; shine a light on all the darkness and eradicate&nbsp; it. that we can all come together and support&nbsp;&nbsp; something good and that not all hope is lost&nbsp; and that we can educate survivors waking up&nbsp;&nbsp; so they're not harming themselves, you know, and&nbsp; teach them about programming like we need you on&nbsp;&nbsp; the front lines, you know, and if people can have&nbsp; five, 10, 15, 100, however many dollars, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; or just a social media page where they can share&nbsp; your music and encourage people to go follow it,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, it it it really does so much to to help&nbsp; this movement go forward. So you're not taken away&nbsp;&nbsp; from your mission and so you can pursue it with&nbsp; all your might knowing that you know you're not&nbsp;&nbsp; going to be stopped by something like finances or&nbsp; you know whatever it is a resource and so I really&nbsp;&nbsp; encourage people to go support you know if you&nbsp; don't have money support her music go hit follow&nbsp;&nbsp; on Spotify you know become a subscriber on YouTube&nbsp; those little things too can really help somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; in their mission help them get visibility share it&nbsp; on your social media page and if you feel called&nbsp;&nbsp; to donate financially Um, I will have her GoFundMe&nbsp; page 100% right in the show notes, no matter what&nbsp;&nbsp; platform you're on. And even if you guys can't&nbsp; donate, um it's also free to go share that on&nbsp;&nbsp; your social media and you can help campaign for&nbsp; her, you know, and and help her seek justice to&nbsp;&nbsp; get her children, you know, and and maybe there's&nbsp; some people in your social media feeds who have&nbsp;&nbsp; some extra money and and who are really looking&nbsp; for somewhere to put it, you know, we need to&nbsp;&nbsp; put it in the in the pockets of survivors and&nbsp; not into these corrupt people stealing money on&nbsp;&nbsp; behalf of survivors. You know, we think we're&nbsp; doing all this good and we're really not. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, Kadia, thank you for sharing all of that.&nbsp; I there's no problem at all and and and just&nbsp;&nbsp; offering it as a way for people to help, you know,&nbsp; and there's obviously lots of other ways that&nbsp;&nbsp; people can support you, too. And I want everybody&nbsp; to support you so you can continue this journey.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you. I I appreciate that. And it's it's it's&nbsp; true. We need to support one another because fear&nbsp;&nbsp; of lack and fear of scarcity is what keeps a lot&nbsp; of people quiet. and afraid to leave uh handle the&nbsp;&nbsp; the cult, you know, or their handlers because they&nbsp; strategically will set it up so that you actually&nbsp;&nbsp; don't, you know, um yeah, you they're they have&nbsp; a handle on all the finances, right? And so,&nbsp;&nbsp; um it's tempting, right? Cuz all I had to, Emma,&nbsp; all I had to do to get my kids and my life back&nbsp;&nbsp; and access to my bank account was say, "Yep, I'm&nbsp; mentally ill. These were delusions and these were&nbsp;&nbsp; were false memories." That's all I had to say. And&nbsp; there may be situations where where people are led&nbsp;&nbsp; to act like David did when he was fleeing King&nbsp; Saul as King Saul was trying to murder him. He&nbsp;&nbsp; uh he pretended to um he pretended to act&nbsp; in he pretended to go insane, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; or when Rahab lied to the spies in order to,&nbsp; you know, in the book of Joshua in order to hide&nbsp;&nbsp; uh and protect the mission of y, you know, Israel&nbsp; at this time. So, so there there are times where&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe Yahw will have us do these these types&nbsp; of things. Um, so I don't want to encourage&nbsp;&nbsp; people to just go out there and belligerently&nbsp; belligerently start splashing around um the&nbsp;&nbsp; truth of things that they remember or things that&nbsp; they know without a wisdom. Um, but if we can,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, help, you know, collectively support&nbsp; one another, whether it's me or another survivor,&nbsp;&nbsp; that will help them to say, "No, no, yeah, I&nbsp; may lose everything. I may lose my children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, but if I stay quiet and if I don't leave the&nbsp; cult, I can never get them out. We can't help&nbsp;&nbsp; them. We cannot protect our children if we stay&nbsp; in. And so ye so the best way that we can support&nbsp;&nbsp; one another really truly is um I think like&nbsp; however yah would lead if it's, you know, I've&nbsp;&nbsp; been incredibly blessed. For example, I'll tell&nbsp; you just an absolute miracle um that happened. I&nbsp;&nbsp; mentioned I had had no clothes where I was where&nbsp; I was dropped off. I was I didn't have a car,&nbsp;&nbsp; not enough money um to buy the things I needed.&nbsp; And so I prayed. I said I said, "Aba," I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would love for you to supernaturally provide&nbsp; for me a wardrobe." Um I I said, "I just you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know what I would like. You know what&nbsp; would fit. You know what would feel good,&nbsp;&nbsp; what would feel comfortable. You know what&nbsp; you would find me beautiful and lovely in.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know what would what I could wear that would&nbsp; dignify me. And a lot of these these parts of me,&nbsp;&nbsp; especially the littles in my personality system&nbsp; that have been so severely defiled, I said, you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, what would help dignify us and help us walk&nbsp; a little taller, a little straighter, feel good,&nbsp;&nbsp; um feel like a person again? um and what would&nbsp; would testify and and witness um of your goodness&nbsp;&nbsp; to others as a as a child of God. And so I prayed&nbsp; this in the winter and uh this this past month I&nbsp;&nbsp; have had the opportunity to stay with a with a&nbsp; friend um just a really close beloved sister of&nbsp;&nbsp; mine. Um and um unbeknownst to me in since I had&nbsp; prayed that prayer um she had begun to shop for&nbsp;&nbsp; me. Um and she put together an entire wardrobe of&nbsp; beautiful natural fiber cotton and linen garments.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and she brought them and and and um um they&nbsp; just they fit like a glove. And so there's just&nbsp;&nbsp; like an example that might seem like in the&nbsp; grand scheme of things, not a big deal. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; but just those small things can go a long way.&nbsp; Even if you have like extra clothes or all you&nbsp;&nbsp; can afford to do is shop at the secondhand store.&nbsp; Um, you can pray and ask Aba what it is you could&nbsp;&nbsp; do to bless that person and he will pick out a&nbsp; need for them that is so specific. He will reveal&nbsp;&nbsp; to you a prayer uh of their heart that nobody else&nbsp; has heard that he will use you to answer. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wanted to give a little testimony of that.&nbsp; That is so so amazing. And you know I I think it's&nbsp;&nbsp; going to resonate with a lot of people who do&nbsp; feel compelled. You know every a lot of people&nbsp;&nbsp; want to help. A lot of people want to help. They&nbsp; just don't because they don't know what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; They don't realize that help can be so simple.&nbsp; It can be a prayer, you know, it can be going&nbsp;&nbsp; to a secondhand store, you know, and hearing&nbsp; that, I hope, is sort of directing people in&nbsp;&nbsp; a way that can help them be creative with what&nbsp; they can do, whether they have limited time,&nbsp;&nbsp; limited finances. You know, we can all step up and&nbsp; help. And we really have to get to a point where&nbsp;&nbsp; we're leaving these old systems behind where it's&nbsp; greed and ego and, you know, authority ruling and&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of the slavery system that we're in where,&nbsp; you know, we are the ones that are sort of at the&nbsp;&nbsp; disposal of the people ruling over us. And we need&nbsp; to look at all the people in our communities and&nbsp;&nbsp; around us and and see how we can take care of each&nbsp; other because they're not doing it for us, you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, and and if anything, they're they're really&nbsp; penalizing the the people who suffer the most. You&nbsp;&nbsp; know, there shouldn't be a single person in this&nbsp; world who's homeless or who doesn't have food,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, when you look at all the wealth and&nbsp; all all the food that exists and water, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's an atrocity that that somebody anybody is&nbsp; without a home or without a drink, you know, or&nbsp;&nbsp; without healthcare. But unfortunately, that's the&nbsp; world that we live in where, you know, basic needs&nbsp;&nbsp; are some of the most expensive and uh hard to get&nbsp; things sometimes when you're going through a hard&nbsp;&nbsp; time like what you are where you have people&nbsp; actively keeping you from being resourced and&nbsp;&nbsp; financed and with the ability to get the help that&nbsp; you need and the support that you need, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and and the fact that you've had to navigate&nbsp; all this yourself just blows my mind. Like I&nbsp;&nbsp; can't as a grown adult. I can't even put myself in&nbsp; your shoes of thinking about contending with with&nbsp;&nbsp; the memory recollection with all the things in&nbsp; internally that that you've had to go through and&nbsp;&nbsp; and heal through and then on the external world&nbsp; all the things that happened to you at the same&nbsp;&nbsp; time, you know, and being completely abandoned&nbsp; by really any anybody or anything that could be&nbsp;&nbsp; of help for you, you know, and support. And so I&nbsp; just I mean there's nobody more courageous or or&nbsp;&nbsp; more strong or more willful or persistent or&nbsp; brave than survivors, you know, and we have&nbsp;&nbsp; so much to learn from that of how resilient we&nbsp; all are and that we can all get through these&nbsp;&nbsp; hard times no matter how much we want to give up,&nbsp; you know. And one other thing I wanted to to talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about regarding these topics, you had sent over&nbsp; some photos and you had talked about, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we we don't fight against flesh and blood, we&nbsp; fight against powers and principalities, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I think some of the experiences that you have&nbsp; sort of blend those two, you know, we can feel&nbsp;&nbsp; physical symptoms from spiritual disease almost,&nbsp; you know, which makes us believe that maybe our&nbsp;&nbsp; bodies are are ill when in fact Sometimes these&nbsp; spiritual attacks and the way that um our trauma&nbsp;&nbsp; can manifest can be through our flesh and blood&nbsp; and can make it seem physical when it's actually&nbsp;&nbsp; an energy trying to seep through you know or a&nbsp; spirit that is um you know inhabiting our bodies&nbsp;&nbsp; or attacking us you know and so I wanted you to&nbsp; share a little bit about that as well because I&nbsp;&nbsp; think a lot of people suffer with that. I think&nbsp; a lot of um people get misdiagnosed for symptoms&nbsp;&nbsp; of trauma versus actually having a disease or a&nbsp; condition that doctors are trained to diagnose&nbsp;&nbsp; people with. Um and you actually have some photos&nbsp; here, like I said, that we can share to help&nbsp;&nbsp; educate people, you know, and especially survivors&nbsp; who might be experiencing something similar to&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of look at health and trauma a different&nbsp; way of how it can manifest in our bodies. Yeah. Yeah. Would you like to bring up some of&nbsp; those photos and we can Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh so so an AB reaction um for those who don't&nbsp; know is when your trauma when you're processing&nbsp;&nbsp; trauma and memories come to the surface to be&nbsp; released um the body will um sometimes not always&nbsp;&nbsp; um manifest in a in a visual way the type of abuse&nbsp; that was perpetrated from the memory. Most people&nbsp;&nbsp; will experience this is in sensations or pains,&nbsp; distress emotionally and physically tension in&nbsp;&nbsp; their muscles. But there are a lot of cases&nbsp; of AB reactions that and this is common where&nbsp;&nbsp; people will even start you know bleeding from&nbsp; a a specific orifice that was maybe raped or&nbsp;&nbsp; mutilated or brutalized or a bruise will rise&nbsp; to the surface. Um I have lots of examples of&nbsp;&nbsp; these but a couple of them that I have shared um&nbsp; with you here um this one is uh puncture wounds&nbsp;&nbsp; from the uh admin from um from a few different&nbsp; things. Uh one was an extraction of adrenochrome&nbsp;&nbsp; um that happened to me in childhood uh up till&nbsp; about the age of eight. You're not when I was&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer a viable use for it. um as well as&nbsp; injection uh sites for the administration of&nbsp;&nbsp; anesthesia um drugs and there's a lot of poking&nbsp; and proddding and needling with uh electric&nbsp;&nbsp; currents that go through various parts of the skin&nbsp; and if you're dealing with a particularly unhinged&nbsp;&nbsp; um yeah I had very methodical programmer and I&nbsp; also had one who was very unhinged who would like&nbsp;&nbsp; willy-nilly um just poke right with these needles&nbsp; um in order to just create uh shocks and distress&nbsp;&nbsp; um for conditioning certain behavioral uh&nbsp; responses that were desired for the program. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and so these are a couple of examples of just some&nbsp; of the holes that came to the surface of my skin&nbsp;&nbsp; um, while I was um, receiving um, some counseling&nbsp; and and ministry um, from somebody in my support&nbsp;&nbsp; system um, and I would manifest the pain,&nbsp; yell ouch, and then the uh, the sight of&nbsp;&nbsp; the administration of the needle in the memory was&nbsp; brought to the surface of my skin which was quite&nbsp;&nbsp; astonishing for onlookers. It really is. And I&nbsp; think it's really fascinating, too. You hear over&nbsp;&nbsp; and over again how when somebody figures out what&nbsp; the lingering pain manifesting in the body is,&nbsp;&nbsp; if they can get the memory that it's from um&nbsp; and understand what what is bringing that to the&nbsp;&nbsp; surface, what actually happened like that could&nbsp; look to somebody else like maybe an insect bite,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, or something they could label it as&nbsp; where when you actually have the the tangible&nbsp;&nbsp; memory of whatever it was that physically hurt&nbsp; you, many times and maybe you can attest to this.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've heard that these reactions go away. So these&nbsp; things that manifest once you pour acknowledgement&nbsp;&nbsp; into it and heal the memory and sit with it a&nbsp; lot of times these lingering things that could&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe be diagnosed as say a chronic rash or a&nbsp; chronic disease or something that you have to&nbsp;&nbsp; go on medication for forever, you know, they can&nbsp; heal themselves through memory work. It's really&nbsp;&nbsp; remarkable. In fact, I I I believe most diseases,&nbsp; especially chronic inflammation or chronic&nbsp;&nbsp; um illnesses, autoimmune disease,&nbsp; chronic inflammation in the body,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of those are manifestations of&nbsp; trauma. Um and they need to come up and out and I just I'll move on to the next one. Yeah,&nbsp; that's just another example of the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; That one's a little easier to see because uh some&nbsp; of the needles were really big, like wide gauged,&nbsp;&nbsp; very wide gauge needles uh that were used. Oh my&nbsp; gosh. And it it really is like it's just it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp; phenomenal to me that something like that can&nbsp; pop up on your body out of the blue seemingly,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, even though we know why it does. But&nbsp; it's like h it's just amazing how strong memory&nbsp;&nbsp; is, you know, to really just like sit with&nbsp; that for a minute and to think how powerful&nbsp;&nbsp; our memories are that it can bring about something&nbsp; physical on our skin like a wound, a needle wound,&nbsp;&nbsp; a big needle wound because we're remembering&nbsp; something that happened in our past that our&nbsp;&nbsp; past can literally show up on our body in a&nbsp; moment. I mean, it's just incredible how how&nbsp;&nbsp; behind the times we are with with this and how&nbsp; many people could benefit from knowing this,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, from whether it's a trauma, a traumatic&nbsp; event or life like what you grew up in or,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, different types of trauma andor abuse or&nbsp; medical trauma that people have gone through and&nbsp;&nbsp; the different ways that that our medical system&nbsp; is gaslighting and abusing people even unknowingly&nbsp;&nbsp; that these doctors are just doing what they're&nbsp; taught, you know, and it's just really wild.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is a really important you know kind&nbsp; of slideshow that you've created for us. Uh so this this example on the screen you see a&nbsp; burn like a burn mark on my hand. So that is an&nbsp;&nbsp; ab reaction from an electrode burn and the size&nbsp; of the electrode as you can see covers most of&nbsp;&nbsp; my hand. Uh because these electrode pads, this&nbsp; was from a memory where electrode pads um I was&nbsp;&nbsp; really little and so the electro pads were huge.&nbsp; You know, my hand like I was toddler age so these&nbsp;&nbsp; but these were like a big adult-siz electrodes&nbsp; and so they use the hands and feet a lot and so&nbsp;&nbsp; that's why the electrode burn covers so much of&nbsp; the hand. Um, yeah, cuz I was just so young. And&nbsp;&nbsp; so this this Yeah, there's another picture of it.&nbsp; The next couple of pictures are are from this AB&nbsp;&nbsp; reaction. Um, so one of the things that I've one&nbsp; of the reasons we've been writing and producing&nbsp;&nbsp; music in 444 hertz in the key of David using the&nbsp; word of Yah, we're um releasing actually a song&nbsp;&nbsp; tonight, a new song tonight. Uh, so we get we're&nbsp; going to um most of the song drops that we are&nbsp;&nbsp; having these days have been on YouTube because&nbsp; we're uploading um our first album to Spotify&nbsp;&nbsp; um probably in the next couple months and then&nbsp; the second one um is is uh forthcoming. But as&nbsp;&nbsp; we were listening to this music, this is an&nbsp; example of how powerful this frequency is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, I began to get flashbacks and memories in&nbsp; the studio uh during the production process,&nbsp;&nbsp; especially not just um the the singing process,&nbsp; but the production process. And so I was in the&nbsp;&nbsp; studio and suddenly this jolt of electric energy&nbsp; rushes through my body and burns my skin. And I&nbsp;&nbsp; it was so so sharp and shocking, no pun intended,&nbsp; that I screamed, "Ow!" And then um uh I was asked&nbsp;&nbsp; if I was okay and I said, "Yeah, the pain came&nbsp; and left. It left as soon as it was gone, but it&nbsp;&nbsp; came with the flashback of this memory of being uh&nbsp; tortured with electroshock." And uh and I looked&nbsp;&nbsp; down and uh right where these electrode pads had&nbsp; burned the most in my memory as I was experiencing&nbsp;&nbsp; this flashback, this rash erupted to the surface.&nbsp; And then you'll see here the last p is the same uh&nbsp;&nbsp; event, but it had kind of begun to scab over. Oh&nbsp; my goodness. And how long, for example, this one,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure it's different for every reaction that&nbsp; manifests physically like like these ones do that&nbsp;&nbsp; we're showing. How long do these typically last&nbsp; to where you're feeling the pain or you're feeling&nbsp;&nbsp; what happened in your memory? It's completely&nbsp; dependent based on the memory. I have had&nbsp;&nbsp; memories that have come forth that have left me&nbsp; in a crippling pain and an inability to function&nbsp;&nbsp; and a lot of distress as it was coming up and&nbsp; out um for for weeks. And then others is just a&nbsp;&nbsp; moment. Um and it just it really kind of depends.&nbsp; There's there's a lot more to um that I I still&nbsp;&nbsp; need healing from that I can feel. um um needs to&nbsp; come out, but that happens when we're ready for&nbsp;&nbsp; it. Um otherwise, we have a psychotic break or you&nbsp; know end up in in the psych ward or or with severe&nbsp;&nbsp; amnesia in a similar way that I mentioned in the&nbsp; last interview with that whole story. But yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's um it's quite fascinating and I know it&nbsp; sounds like oh that's really nice. I I you know I&nbsp;&nbsp; don't want people to be afraid to go listen to the&nbsp; music there. I'm not saying you're going to start&nbsp;&nbsp; to have flashbacks and experience horrific ab&nbsp; reactions. Um, but this has just been the process&nbsp;&nbsp; of of of what Yahw has been doing with me through&nbsp; through his spirit is that when we are ready and&nbsp;&nbsp; we are in the process and ready for memories to&nbsp; return and needing amnesic barriers to come down&nbsp;&nbsp; by his divine hand, he will do it for he will do&nbsp; it at a pace that we're ready for it. And so the&nbsp;&nbsp; music has been a really helpful uh has been really&nbsp; helpful to me in this in this process because it&nbsp;&nbsp; can be very tormenting. And as David soothed Saul&nbsp; with his playing when he was being tormented by&nbsp;&nbsp; evil spirits, um we do have access uh to that same&nbsp; kind of power. You know, it's not a magic spell.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um there are a lot of different frequencies,&nbsp; but when we're walking in faith and obedience&nbsp;&nbsp; and a covenant with the most high yah through&nbsp; faith in Christ, um we can sing in the key of&nbsp;&nbsp; David ourselves. We can produce and tune our&nbsp; instruments to 444 hertz and we can start to&nbsp;&nbsp; watch those amnesic barriers fall and that trauma&nbsp; come to the surface so that we can work through&nbsp;&nbsp; it and process through it with a with a you know&nbsp; ideally the Holy Spirit he's our he's our good&nbsp;&nbsp; counselor and you know his ministry is sufficient&nbsp; but we often have people in supporting roles&nbsp;&nbsp; um not everybody is able to do that and So&nbsp; if that's not you, it's okay. His grace um&nbsp;&nbsp; is sufficient. But if you Google for example um if&nbsp; you Google put into a Google search uh um if you&nbsp;&nbsp; put into a Google search uh battles music battles&nbsp; and music in the Bible you will get a hundred&nbsp;&nbsp; different Bible verses and examples of Satan's&nbsp; army of darkness being utterly smited smold&nbsp;&nbsp; utterly destroyed just through the instruments,&nbsp; just through the worship, the tambourines or&nbsp;&nbsp; the singing or the the music, the worship and the&nbsp; praise of the people of Yah, the people of Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, you'll see examples where he actually&nbsp; sends to the very front lines of the battle,&nbsp;&nbsp; the scariest place to be, where you face the&nbsp; most onslaught, the most resistance. He senses&nbsp;&nbsp; musicians up front. That is the kind of power&nbsp; that we have in him to not use um carnal weapons&nbsp;&nbsp; but spiritual ones. And so this has been my story&nbsp; with the music and why I'm so eager and passionate&nbsp;&nbsp; to write and produce it and use his word. Um&nbsp; and all of us here together, the three of us,&nbsp;&nbsp; the three of us here together that are producing&nbsp; it are experiencing a ton of healing. A ton of&nbsp;&nbsp; veils are being ripped. Laura Sanger, who I'm&nbsp; sure many of your listeners may or may not&nbsp;&nbsp; have heard of, who wrote No Longer Enslaved, she&nbsp; talks a lot about the power of frequency and and&nbsp;&nbsp; of praise and and of worship um in Healing. And&nbsp; unfortunately, a lot of Christian music out there&nbsp;&nbsp; has been intentionally twisted by the deceiver&nbsp; to be in the wrong frequency or to include um&nbsp;&nbsp; a false or a twisted doctrine um to actually keep&nbsp; veils in place. Many Christian songs are used in&nbsp;&nbsp; programming and that was the case for me. And so&nbsp; um that's just something to pray for discernment&nbsp;&nbsp; about. and your music, like how she said, it's on&nbsp; YouTube, it's on Spotify, so you guys can connect&nbsp;&nbsp; with her. Um, and I encourage you guys, too. I&nbsp; mean, especially if you're a survivor and you're&nbsp;&nbsp; wanting to heal, music is something that that&nbsp; helps calm you or that that you love. I think&nbsp;&nbsp; on some level music is so incredibly healing for&nbsp; all of us or at least we think it is, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's really terrible how they have tampered&nbsp; with the frequencies over time and how our music&nbsp;&nbsp; is it might feel consciously like it feels good,&nbsp; you know, but internally it's it's sort of going&nbsp;&nbsp; into our body in a way that acts as a toxin and&nbsp; we might not even know it. And so I love that&nbsp;&nbsp; you're helping us detox with music that is in the&nbsp; right key and is in the right note and frequency,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, because that is so healing. We hear&nbsp; all the time about people buying these different&nbsp;&nbsp; frequency machines just to keep in their home&nbsp; to elevate the frequency of the of their home&nbsp;&nbsp; and their environment right directly, you&nbsp; know, around them and encompassing them.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think that it's it's just something really&nbsp; important to think about that we don't, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and we're s we're always surrounded by Wi-Fi and&nbsp; these, you know, 5G and these frequencies that&nbsp;&nbsp; want to harm us. So, one of the best ways to help&nbsp; combat that is by, you know, doing the opposite,&nbsp;&nbsp; putting on a frequency, having frequency around&nbsp; you, listening to high frequency music that that&nbsp;&nbsp; is detoxing the the harmful effects of all the&nbsp; different negative frequencies that are around&nbsp;&nbsp; us. And I really love that you, you know, I'm&nbsp; really surprised that more people aren't doing&nbsp;&nbsp; what you're doing, but I really think it it was&nbsp; meant for you to do so you could bring that to&nbsp;&nbsp; the forefront. I couldn't think of a better person&nbsp; to help introduce this concept than you, you know?&nbsp;&nbsp; But whenever you learn about this frequency and&nbsp; you learn about how toxic so much of our music is,&nbsp;&nbsp; it just makes you question like how how are&nbsp; more people not defying that? Like everybody's&nbsp;&nbsp; defying all these other aspects of society.&nbsp; chemtrails and pesticides and GMOs, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; but when it comes to something that affects us on&nbsp; a cellular level 24 hours a day like frequency,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, we're we're not fighting for that, you&nbsp; know, as hard. And so, I love that you're coming&nbsp;&nbsp; into that conversation with a solution, you&nbsp; know, and one that that fights with love and&nbsp;&nbsp; compassion and and, you know, sort of gets gets&nbsp; us on the right track. It's really amazing. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; I do encourage people to go follow your work, you&nbsp; know, especially hearing what you went through and&nbsp;&nbsp; seeing these photos, actual visuals of ways&nbsp; that energies were negatively impacting you,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and realizing the the strength that we&nbsp; can fight that with with something like music.&nbsp;&nbsp; Amen. Yes. It's been been huge. I was I was in&nbsp; a state of absolute despair because this is such&nbsp;&nbsp; an overwhelming process to go through healing&nbsp; discovering that you have a dissociative disorder&nbsp;&nbsp; or have multiple personalities and then you're&nbsp; trying to escape the cult and then you're in a&nbsp;&nbsp; safe place and they're still pursuing your life&nbsp; and it it's just absolutely overwhelming to have&nbsp;&nbsp; to navigate through. And so I was pleading with&nbsp; with Yah um with my sister who produces writes&nbsp;&nbsp; and produces the music with me what there's got to&nbsp; be a key. There's got to be a key. You say in your&nbsp;&nbsp; word, to you I give the secrets of the kingdom if&nbsp; you're walking in righteousness and faith. And he&nbsp;&nbsp; said immediately, he said, it's the key of David.&nbsp; And uh so we just poured ourselves into the music&nbsp;&nbsp; as a first priority. And it's just also just been&nbsp; so much fun. I love that. And I think it's just so&nbsp;&nbsp; creative that you thought outside of the box, even&nbsp; right down to the words that you use, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and using non-triggering words. Um, I think&nbsp; that this will keep growing in our community,&nbsp;&nbsp; especially Oops, I just skipped the wrong one.&nbsp; Um, it'll keep growing in our community and&nbsp;&nbsp; and become a need that people see more and more&nbsp; that that can be healing for them. So, I'm really&nbsp;&nbsp; proud of you and really excited to watch your&nbsp; journey with this music unfold. And like I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll have all of that in the show notes for you&nbsp; guys. And hopefully some of you feel validation&nbsp;&nbsp; too seeing these different photos. And I'll have&nbsp; you share about this one too, but I know a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of survivors go through these AB reactions and&nbsp; and have a lot of different health issues that&nbsp;&nbsp; can probably be very easy to be dismissed or&nbsp; misdiagnosed. So, um I'm really happy that&nbsp;&nbsp; we're able to see that your documentation of of&nbsp; your own uh reactions so we can actually sort of,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, understand something that we're never&nbsp; taught about trauma and how it can manifest. Yeah, thank you. This is a video here um as you&nbsp; can see of an AB reaction while uh processing and&nbsp;&nbsp; remembering um electroshock therapy. This&nbsp; is something that happens really commonly&nbsp;&nbsp; um not just on the shoulder but on my legs and&nbsp; any area of my body where any electrode was put&nbsp;&nbsp; uh you'll see this type of manifestation. And so&nbsp; this will happen often um during a flashback or&nbsp;&nbsp; um after you know a deep session of of&nbsp; ministering prayer. Oh my gosh. I have heard&nbsp;&nbsp; of a lot of people who say that they get, you&nbsp; know, what they think are like muscle spasms or&nbsp;&nbsp; um twitches, you know, and um it's really helpful&nbsp; to be able to potentially pair a memory with that&nbsp;&nbsp; and and or to sort of think outside the box of&nbsp; maybe it's not that you're low on electrolytes&nbsp;&nbsp; or you need to eat something with potassium&nbsp; in it. That this is your body remembering&nbsp;&nbsp; something and trying to share it with you,&nbsp; you know. And that's amazing that you were&nbsp;&nbsp; able to capture that because I'm sure it can&nbsp; be sort of hard in those moments too to kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of grab a camera or something and record it&nbsp; as it's happening if it's fleeting. Yeah. So this is uh called palm planter pular psoriasis&nbsp; and I developed this in 2018. Uh when I uh began&nbsp;&nbsp; to defy my programming and the cult in my pursuit&nbsp; of truth through the word of yah. Uh there's&nbsp;&nbsp; all kinds of programming implemented to inflict&nbsp; the body. Um it's done very physically but also&nbsp;&nbsp; uh through um spirits that come in um and parts&nbsp; that are activated that have the spiritual power&nbsp;&nbsp; from these demons in order to inflict this kind&nbsp; of horror. And so I developed this psoriasis&nbsp;&nbsp; um on my hand, my arms, mostly my legs, and the&nbsp; bottoms of my feet, which was the worst because&nbsp;&nbsp; it really impaired my ability to walk when it&nbsp; was really bad. Um and so that's what this is.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then um I think hopefully it's the next&nbsp; video you'll see a miracle of healing. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp; of course I had to show off my garden. Um because&nbsp; there's just hope. There's just so much hope in&nbsp;&nbsp; the garden. A scripture starts and ends in the&nbsp; garden. Um and you'll see there is no psoriasis&nbsp;&nbsp; whatsoever. It completely heed healed up through&nbsp; the laying on of hands when I was rescued to a&nbsp;&nbsp; place of refuge. Um a after I escaped the cult and&nbsp; I talk talked about that in the last interview.&nbsp;&nbsp; uh my psoriasis disappeared. Um and so that was&nbsp; just an absolute miracle um that was administered&nbsp;&nbsp; through the body of of Christ through the laying&nbsp; on of hands. And when your body is in a safe&nbsp;&nbsp; place and it starts to decompress and trauma can&nbsp; start to come out and come forth, sometimes you'll&nbsp;&nbsp; go through what's known as a healing crisis and&nbsp; things might kind of flare up and get worse before&nbsp;&nbsp; they get better. It's it's like a detox, right?&nbsp; And so, uh, that was a total miracle just to watch&nbsp;&nbsp; that basically evaporate before our eyes, um, in&nbsp; the weeks following that laying on of hands and&nbsp;&nbsp; that prayer and that just oh, the the horror of&nbsp; realizing everything that had gone on and that is&nbsp;&nbsp; still going on, but yet the safety of knowing that&nbsp; I'm in a place of refuge and that this now can be&nbsp;&nbsp; a season of healing. Um and uh yeah, you know, the&nbsp; seeing just seeing the garden the garden there,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, I think a lot of survivors and I&nbsp; encourage this um have found a lot of therapy a&nbsp;&nbsp; therapeutic benefits um in keeping and maintaining&nbsp; a garden. And so I had the opportunity to start a&nbsp;&nbsp; start a garden from from scratch from a patch of&nbsp; dirt and just sew in hope as just a a prayer and a&nbsp;&nbsp; prophecy of just the harvest that comes forth. um&nbsp; when we are faithful and we walk in truth and and&nbsp;&nbsp; when we do the right thing um the the labor of our&nbsp; hands and the labor of our hearts will not return&nbsp;&nbsp; void. It really will not. And so this is just an&nbsp; encouragement um for anyone out there. Oh my gosh,&nbsp;&nbsp; I love the garden and I love seeing your healed&nbsp; skin, you know, and and the way that God worked&nbsp;&nbsp; miracles on you and you and yourself or having&nbsp; the courage to pursue healing, you know, and to&nbsp;&nbsp; not just sort of slap on a diagnosis on yourself&nbsp; and treat it with, you know, western medicine, but&nbsp;&nbsp; actually do the inner work to identify what the&nbsp; root cause of it was. Would you have any advice&nbsp;&nbsp; for survivors who may be in different levels of&nbsp; healing and memory recall but might be questioning&nbsp;&nbsp; if something that they're experiencing healthwise&nbsp; is a memory or if it's something that they&nbsp;&nbsp; actually need to go get help for? Do you have any&nbsp; tips on how they might be able to tap into that&nbsp;&nbsp; and and see? You mentioned a safe environment. I&nbsp; feel like that's a really good a good tip. Do you&nbsp;&nbsp; have any other ways that could maybe be helpful?&nbsp; Recognizing patterns of when symptoms are flaring&nbsp;&nbsp; up and trying to pay attention and documenting&nbsp; those can help. Um, for example, I noticed a&nbsp;&nbsp; an alleviation of very specific symptoms when I&nbsp; was not around certain people. And as I began to&nbsp;&nbsp; go through uh as parts in my my system um which&nbsp; I sometimes call a bus and sometimes call Ktown&nbsp;&nbsp; that was affect affectionately named um um by&nbsp; someone I love very dearly. Um um when when&nbsp;&nbsp; members of Ktown began to come forward and and&nbsp; make confessions, it it became evident that a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of these symptoms were attached to specific&nbsp; being around specific abusers. And because those&nbsp;&nbsp; amnesic barriers were high, I just thought I had&nbsp; had a bunch of mysterious illnesses or whatever,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, Lyme disease, bartinella, mcass, uh&nbsp; histamine. Um, histamine uh is a real big trend&nbsp;&nbsp; right now. Histamine intoleranced or mass cell&nbsp; activation syndrome. Histamine is actually used&nbsp;&nbsp; and studied in programming and you can research&nbsp; this very easily on the n you know NIH website.&nbsp;&nbsp; um histamine and memory are very closely connected&nbsp; and so it's been very widely studied um how uh&nbsp;&nbsp; blocking uh and interfering with certain histamine&nbsp; receptors actually um inhibits or increases memory&nbsp;&nbsp; recall facial recognition um and different&nbsp; things like that and so um I I don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp; stand here and say everything um is is related&nbsp; to programming and everything is related to to&nbsp;&nbsp; trauma, but it is my belief that the majority&nbsp; of illnesses and symptoms that are out there are&nbsp;&nbsp; rooted spiritually are rooted in trauma. And so I&nbsp; think that you can't go wrong in at least praying&nbsp;&nbsp; about it and exploring that as a possibility. Um&nbsp; and um and just through prayer. A lot of this for&nbsp;&nbsp; me had to be had to I came into awareness just&nbsp; from from the counsel um that comes from the one&nbsp;&nbsp; who can see where I cannot where doctors cannot&nbsp; you know he has you know yeah one of our songs&nbsp;&nbsp; um that we posted um entitled the quickening um&nbsp; goes you know is a petition and a prayer to the&nbsp;&nbsp; seven spirits of God uh the seven spirits of&nbsp; Yahw which are spirits, the spirit of counsel,&nbsp;&nbsp; wisdom, understanding, uh, knowledge, might, his&nbsp; spirit, and then also the fear of Yahw. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp; we need really his counsel. And so, I would just&nbsp; say just pray, go to him and ask. Repentance for&nbsp;&nbsp; me has been a also a part of healing, harboring&nbsp; unforgiveness. Um there's actually secular&nbsp;&nbsp; studies done um a lot of secular studies done&nbsp; that talk about how um unforgiveness increases&nbsp;&nbsp; um your probability of getting cancer. Um and&nbsp; that's because a lot of people have unforgiveness&nbsp;&nbsp; also as a result of trauma. And so it's just kind&nbsp; of a complicated web and we really we really need&nbsp;&nbsp; the wisdom that comes from heaven in order to&nbsp; be able to walk through it because it's really&nbsp;&nbsp; overwhelming. I found navigating I have found&nbsp; navigating illness really really overwhelming.&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you eat? What do you not eat? How do you&nbsp; heal? What is this attributed to? And so without&nbsp;&nbsp; w without praying, I wouldn't know. And some&nbsp; things are still a bit mysterious to me. And&nbsp;&nbsp; so just learning to tr to seek understanding from&nbsp; him but then also trust where I don't understand&nbsp;&nbsp; yet. Um you know has been a process that I'm still&nbsp; navigating. Um yeah so I don't know if that that's&nbsp;&nbsp; too helpful but it's very helpful. And sort of&nbsp; along those same lines, um the last question that&nbsp;&nbsp; I have today that I wanted to ask just about this&nbsp; particular topic of sort of the healing stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp; um ab reactions are one way that our bodies can&nbsp; sort of start harming itself in a way through&nbsp;&nbsp; the energy and through the trauma. Um that's not&nbsp; brought on by the actual survivor doing anything&nbsp;&nbsp; to their body to to um you know actually putting&nbsp; a needle in themselves or anything. This is sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of a a really supernatural process that happens&nbsp; through memory. But there's also the self harm&nbsp;&nbsp; programming that can activate as somebody's&nbsp; remembering. And a lot of survivors are like&nbsp;&nbsp; you when they wake up where they don't know what&nbsp; did. They've never heard of mind control. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; they're trying to do the right thing by getting&nbsp; help and disclosing. And programming is triggering&nbsp;&nbsp; them to do the opposite. you know, instead of&nbsp; healing, it's it's it's trying to get them to&nbsp;&nbsp; harm themselves um in different ways. And I wanted&nbsp; to see how you dealt with that when and if it&nbsp;&nbsp; happened to you. And of course, any any guidance&nbsp; you could give people listening who may or may not&nbsp;&nbsp; be experiencing that. um you know, how to maybe&nbsp; navigate that if somebody does remember or you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, if somebody's in the process of remembering&nbsp; and sort of how to uh how to navigate that. Wow, that is that's a deep that's a really deep&nbsp; one that and that was something that I really&nbsp;&nbsp; struggled with um even recently um with the&nbsp; urge to there because there are parts right&nbsp;&nbsp; with with the urge to self harm and I would say&nbsp; that underneath the surface of that is a deep&nbsp;&nbsp; deep self-hatred and a deep deep self-loathing&nbsp; and a perpetuation of the abuse abuse onto self&nbsp;&nbsp; because there were parts that were that I that&nbsp; were in in my system um are even are in my system&nbsp;&nbsp; that are introjections of particular handlers or&nbsp; particular programmers or abusers that are meant&nbsp;&nbsp; to inflict harm as a punishment or a consequence&nbsp; for violating the program or for for disob&nbsp;&nbsp; um disob disobedience. And so what those&nbsp; what what really needs to happen there is&nbsp;&nbsp; for those parts to come out of hiding and into&nbsp; the light of of of their worth and their value&nbsp;&nbsp; um and to to basically receive just the ministry&nbsp; of love. I believe the ministry of love and the&nbsp;&nbsp; ministry of acceptance. Um, I'm not sure that&nbsp; those behaviors can go away though until there&nbsp;&nbsp; are parts that come forward to confess the&nbsp; reasons why they hate themselves so much.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it's something that they have done in&nbsp; the cult that they were forced to do. They&nbsp;&nbsp; don't understand perhaps how they were programmed&nbsp; because a lot of them um have been told that they&nbsp;&nbsp; are bad or that they are evil and did not know&nbsp; that they weren't doing things out of their own&nbsp;&nbsp; free will but they were doing things as they&nbsp; were programmed to do. Um and so I I I tend&nbsp;&nbsp; to look at self harm almost always. Um I used to&nbsp; think it was like a like de like a just demons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and um, and you know, it's it's not I&nbsp; think it's more complicated. There's often&nbsp;&nbsp; pain and trauma from other parts that have been&nbsp; fragmented, whether through ritual abuse or not,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, that are um, screaming out for help and&nbsp; there's no other way for them to express the&nbsp;&nbsp; pain. I have a silent scream that is very&nbsp; closely connected to a self harm program.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that silent scream is very common amongst&nbsp; survivors who were not able to ask for help or&nbsp;&nbsp; when they did they were punished for it. And so um&nbsp; giving these parts any form of expression even if&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't have someone who is trusted who these&nbsp; parts can come forward and emote to or interact&nbsp;&nbsp; with or receive ministry or prayer or just love&nbsp; and affection from. Um, you can get a sketchbook,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can pick up a notepad, you can begin to write,&nbsp; and you can begin to just speak into yourself and&nbsp;&nbsp; say, "Is there any part broken part of me that is&nbsp; in pain that that would like to talk, would like&nbsp;&nbsp; to talk about what happened, would like to show&nbsp; me or just give me a word." And you can draw,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can write poetry, and you can just try to&nbsp; see what comes up and allow these parts to come&nbsp;&nbsp; forward and to receive them in love and to receive&nbsp; them in appreciation and to to start to understand&nbsp;&nbsp; the things that are keeping them bound that&nbsp; are keeping that part of our soul bound so that&nbsp;&nbsp; they can receive freedom. Thank you so much for&nbsp; that. That's to me has been weighing on my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; You see the desperation and the will of people&nbsp; wanting to get free and then unfortunately in&nbsp;&nbsp; our community, those same some of those same&nbsp; people who make it past actually getting out,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is such a huge step end up falling to the&nbsp; pitfalls of self harm, you know, and and it's&nbsp;&nbsp; just so incredibly sad. And I feel like if people&nbsp; are just aware of this, we can help support our&nbsp;&nbsp; friends and and family and people in our lives&nbsp; that end up remembering um things that they&nbsp;&nbsp; went through. And then also that survivors can or&nbsp; people that think that they might be survivors can&nbsp;&nbsp; be educated enough for when those times come if if&nbsp; they think that they're a survivor or think that&nbsp;&nbsp; they might have memory coming up, you know, that&nbsp; they're also equipped with understanding what what&nbsp;&nbsp; might happen, you know, the good, the bad, the&nbsp; ugly, um, and sort of how to navigate that. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; I really really appreciate your perspective&nbsp; on that. And it's, you know, what a miracle&nbsp;&nbsp; that you've been over, you've been able to&nbsp; overcome that so many times in your own journey. I'll I'll tell you a little story. I had a I thank&nbsp; you. I I appreciate that. And and and I couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; do it alone. Um I I um have I I'll say have I'm&nbsp; not integrated. Um, and so one of one of my parts,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, so the selfharming part that I have dealt with&nbsp; is is not really much of a cutter, but more of a&nbsp;&nbsp; b like a would I would uh beat my head with my&nbsp; fists to try to get uh, you know, something would&nbsp;&nbsp; trigger it. Something would trigger this part that&nbsp; would cause like head bashing. Um, and you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's it can be a confusing experience, uh, trying&nbsp; to figure out what triggers it. Um, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of I was in so much distress and torment I&nbsp; couldn't make my brain turn off on this loop or&nbsp;&nbsp; something happened um that created a sense of fear&nbsp; or self-hatred, whatever it was. This is what this&nbsp;&nbsp; part did. Um and I um had been praying and asking&nbsp; for help regarding this um and um this this friend&nbsp;&nbsp; of mine who um I've been living with um who by the&nbsp; spirit brought the clothes that I had prayed for.&nbsp;&nbsp; um this part came forward um in front of&nbsp; her and this part had never done that before&nbsp;&nbsp; um in front of anybody that was not a handler&nbsp; or an abuser. And um it was interesting because&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm internally talking to this part that now has&nbsp; full almost full control of the body. I'm now cast&nbsp;&nbsp; to the back me as Kadiah. And um this part um who&nbsp; goes by the name of Zineia um I'm now speaking I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; now at the back and she's in the driver's seat and&nbsp; she's starting to you know hit her fists against&nbsp;&nbsp; her head and I'm speaking into her system into&nbsp; the system telling her that that the thing that&nbsp;&nbsp; triggered it um was not a big deal and it was&nbsp; a small thing I thought and I'm trying to tell&nbsp;&nbsp; her to de to to deescalate that it's okay it's&nbsp; not a big deal and the fact that this happened&nbsp;&nbsp; in front of this friend who I had f you know grown&nbsp; in to love and trust was it was a miracle and she&nbsp;&nbsp; came over to me and she held my hands down and&nbsp; restrained my fists from inflicting any further&nbsp;&nbsp; self harm and she said the opposite of what I&nbsp; was saying she said it That's a big deal and I&nbsp;&nbsp; want to hear why. And this part was able to tell&nbsp; her, okay, this is this is the reason why this&nbsp;&nbsp; was a trigger. I had lost my phone. When we don't&nbsp; have our phone, we are not safe. We cannot call&nbsp;&nbsp; for help. We cannot uh we cannot this, we cannot&nbsp; that. We have to have the phone nearby because if&nbsp;&nbsp; a programmer or a master or a handler calls with&nbsp; a code or instruction and we don't have our phone&nbsp;&nbsp; with us, we get tormented, we get electrocuted,&nbsp; we get strangled, uh we get our head shoved into&nbsp;&nbsp; the toilet or we are punished or you know put into&nbsp; solitary confinement. I didn't know this. I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; know this. I thought I just had these triggers&nbsp; that were stupid and ridiculous and didn't make&nbsp;&nbsp; any sense. Um, and so just through prayer um, and&nbsp; the orchestration of the Holy Spirit, this friend&nbsp;&nbsp; uh, that I was with, this event triggered it. She&nbsp; came forward. She was actually able to speak with&nbsp;&nbsp; this friend and receive healing and understand&nbsp; that she's not where she was. She has been&nbsp;&nbsp; rescued. She's safe now. Nobody has her phone. No&nbsp; programs or handlers even have her phone number&nbsp;&nbsp; anymore. She's not uh she's not she doesn't need&nbsp; to be accessible to them and she doesn't need to&nbsp;&nbsp; feel like she has to have her phone ready in a&nbsp; state of emergency in case something happens all&nbsp;&nbsp; the time. It's not a big deal anymore. Um but I&nbsp; wasn't able to do that process with her. I was&nbsp;&nbsp; handling it wrong. So, I was not counseling this&nbsp; part very well. I was just kind of annoyed with&nbsp;&nbsp; myself and that was just making it worse. That&nbsp; was just making it worse and increasing the self&nbsp;&nbsp; harm behavior, increasing the self-loathing&nbsp; because I didn't have understanding. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; there's just an example of a way that somebody you&nbsp; know full of wisdom full of education about did&nbsp;&nbsp; education about mind control programming education&nbsp; about all of this can help to minister to these&nbsp;&nbsp; parts and if anyone's looking for a secular&nbsp; resource I highly recommend Allison Miller&nbsp;&nbsp; um she has just such a great lay of the land uh&nbsp; such a great workbook that you can work through um&nbsp;&nbsp; on your own um even um called becoming yourself.&nbsp; And I've just found it so incredibly helpful. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; and those who have been learning to support me&nbsp; have as well and she has a YouTube channel. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp; you. We love resources on here. Obviously, of&nbsp; course, our favorite resources come directly from&nbsp;&nbsp; you guys on here um who are creating resources&nbsp; for us. But it's really great to hear, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; what helps you in your journey and the other&nbsp; people, whether it's somebody that you had person&nbsp;&nbsp; in your life, like this woman that you're talking&nbsp; that you talked about who helped you navigate that&nbsp;&nbsp; self harm programming or people who have have&nbsp; existed in in a book that you read, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; or an author or um whatever it is that that helped&nbsp; you along your journey. It's really good to have&nbsp;&nbsp; those available for survivors to sort of create&nbsp; their own toolbox of of references that they can&nbsp;&nbsp; go have. So, I appreciate you sharing that story.&nbsp; You want to bring should we talk about some of the&nbsp;&nbsp; locations since we have stories of that? Let's get&nbsp; let's, you know, let's let's just do that. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp; just get through the photo album and then anything&nbsp; left over we could always meet a different time. So, this is uh interesting. I wanted to mention&nbsp; um if you might tell by the change in my voice,&nbsp;&nbsp; this photo has brought out a a different part&nbsp; in my system to explain. Um so this is the queen&nbsp;&nbsp; um in Massie Tunnel and Massie Tunnel was one&nbsp; of the centers where I was programmed. Uh it&nbsp;&nbsp; is a center for the seed a seed of Satan&nbsp; project pertaining to the beast system.&nbsp;&nbsp; um and the conception of uh crisper technology&nbsp; through various uh rituals. Um and so um one of&nbsp;&nbsp; the things that takes place in this particular&nbsp; area and British Columbia at large, hence its&nbsp;&nbsp; name, British Columbia, we all know uh the the the&nbsp; movie logo Colombia has the Luciferian, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's Lucifer um at the beginning of of those movie&nbsp; movies Colombia Pictures. So, seed of Satan or&nbsp;&nbsp; seed of Lucifer, there's a lot of reptilian hybrid&nbsp; technology pertaining to frogs or dragons, royal&nbsp;&nbsp; bloodline families, uh monsters, hybrids. These&nbsp; are the things that you read about in scripture&nbsp;&nbsp; um that happened in the days of Noah. And of&nbsp; course, it says as it was in the days of Noah&nbsp;&nbsp; in Matthew 24, so it will be in the last days.&nbsp; And so Jude, the book of Jude goes through this&nbsp;&nbsp; uh these types of um um projects, these types,&nbsp; this type of um this these bloodline kingdoms,&nbsp;&nbsp; these hybridizations, this lust for strange flesh.&nbsp; And so ma the queen came uh to open Massie Tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'm sorry. The Queen of England's not coming&nbsp; to open Massie Tunnel. Who cares about a tunnel&nbsp;&nbsp; tunnel by the stinky Fraser River in in British&nbsp; Columbia? So the the Massie tunnel is where there&nbsp;&nbsp; was a lot of electroshock that I went through as&nbsp; well as preparation and uh conception as a remote&nbsp;&nbsp; womb um for uh Nephilim uh Raphaim and uh various&nbsp; um horrific and monstrous gestations, many of&nbsp;&nbsp; which Yah has mercifully protected me from having&nbsp; to remember fully in order to receive healing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um uh you know you might have heard Nathan I think&nbsp; you you know you have had Nathan Reynolds on um he&nbsp;&nbsp; talks about his his family's bloodline pertaining&nbsp; to the dragon and so this is a location where&nbsp;&nbsp; those similar types of things happen. Yeah. Wow.&nbsp; and and so the Massie Tunnel um and not far from&nbsp;&nbsp; the Massie Tunnel is a paper mill where some of my&nbsp; programming also took place. And so you see people&nbsp;&nbsp; walking through it. Where um where exactly is it?&nbsp; Is there anything you can mention that it's around&nbsp;&nbsp; to give people reference if they were going&nbsp; to go look it up or aren't familiar with it?&nbsp;&nbsp; So it's along the Fraser River in British&nbsp; Columbia which is not far from the American border&nbsp;&nbsp; um in Delta and so uh Delta was also part of&nbsp; my programming uh assassin programming um so&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been through beta programming and Delta&nbsp; programming um as well as pro uh programming for&nbsp;&nbsp; um well I guess the related to the&nbsp; delta programming was was for espionage&nbsp;&nbsp; for the military, doing special reconnaissance,&nbsp; um you know, doing certain missions. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; Delta though is a huge the city of Delta, there's&nbsp; North Delta and South Delta, they're both used for&nbsp;&nbsp; um the the creation of Delta assassins. And so&nbsp; these parts were you were created in this tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are corridors. There are many doors in this&nbsp; tunnel. you can see if you drive through it, but&nbsp;&nbsp; you can take a corridor and it will, you know, you&nbsp; know, they know, you know, there's there's there's&nbsp;&nbsp; corridors inside corridors and rooms within rooms&nbsp; within rooms in this place. And so that's where&nbsp;&nbsp; this technology was. Um where I went through some&nbsp; some rituals, some uh some pregnancies um and some&nbsp;&nbsp; you know they don't bring these things often out&nbsp; into full gestation because they really just need&nbsp;&nbsp; to conceive life. Life life seems like a the wrong&nbsp; term. conceive death in your womb in order to be&nbsp;&nbsp; able to feed these things to the dragon that&nbsp; we read about in the book of Revelation that is&nbsp;&nbsp; making war against the seed of of man, the seed&nbsp; of or the seed of Yahw. And you know, it's just&nbsp;&nbsp; so ironic how something so sinister that is used&nbsp; for something so sinister, how they invert it to&nbsp;&nbsp; the public and make it seem like this celebratory&nbsp; moment that is worthy of paparazzi and the queen&nbsp;&nbsp; coming out dressed up, you know, fully garbed&nbsp; up with her makeup and her outfit and high heels&nbsp;&nbsp; and a purse and, you know, it's just so backwards&nbsp; whenever you whenever you think about it. Anytime&nbsp;&nbsp; that I see like events like this with different&nbsp; monuments, now my my brain is always like, what&nbsp;&nbsp; is happening there? If they're celebrating it like&nbsp; this, this has to be something that's not worth&nbsp;&nbsp; celebrating. If that's what they're doing, you&nbsp; know? So, it's really it's pretty neat that you&nbsp;&nbsp; were able to get validation through this through&nbsp; finding this documentation and these photographs&nbsp;&nbsp; that can prove this this location and that show&nbsp; it being publicly, you know, fanaticized over and,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, paparazzi worthy, you know, but also&nbsp; hearing from your side of the story what what&nbsp;&nbsp; these tunnels were actually used for. How many&nbsp; children do you remember being down there with&nbsp;&nbsp; you at any given time? I don't remember anyone&nbsp; except for myself, my programmer, and another&nbsp;&nbsp; man. Oh my gosh. And um I was taken actually to&nbsp; meet the queen um at her uh during her golden&nbsp;&nbsp; jubilee tour in 2002 October in Victoria um at the&nbsp; Parliament building by the Empress uh hotel which&nbsp;&nbsp; is owned by a family who owns something called&nbsp; Monarch Schools. um they're also in San Diego and&nbsp;&nbsp; of course most I think of your viewers know what&nbsp; monarch programming is and so I was a you know a&nbsp;&nbsp; monarch slave. So I was taken to meet the queen&nbsp; at this um at this this you know jubilee event&nbsp;&nbsp; in Victoria um by the Empress Hotel um with this&nbsp; friend of mine by my programmer. Um I I I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; have a full recollection of the day. Um I remember&nbsp; being exorbitantly thirsty while I was waiting to&nbsp;&nbsp; meet her. I had been um prepped on how to properly&nbsp; greet her. Um, and I was and so I had, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; when I h when I have these memories of excessive&nbsp; thirsts, I know that usually scapolopene or some&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of other drug that creates both compliance&nbsp; submission and then also amnesia was used. Um, and&nbsp;&nbsp; so the monarch programming, the queen, um, uh, the&nbsp; serpent seed, and this is all biblical, um, this&nbsp;&nbsp; was all a part of my programming. Victoria, BC&nbsp; was huge. This area was huge. Lower mainland. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; Crown Packaging in Richmond, BC was one location&nbsp; where I was programmed at night. This came forth&nbsp;&nbsp; through a personality uh who uh oh speaks German.&nbsp; I didn't know I spoke German. Um until this part&nbsp;&nbsp; came forward to talk about the paper mill to talk&nbsp; about uh what happened there to her at night. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; and crowned crown of course crown packaging again&nbsp; it's related. All of their codes are really quite&nbsp;&nbsp; out in the open. But the Golmet family, who's a&nbsp; family of German Jewish descent from Frankfurt,&nbsp;&nbsp; um is known for their success in banking and&nbsp; finance. Um and so they have a code of arms of&nbsp;&nbsp; barren with with a with it's um there's they're&nbsp; closely related to the Roth Rothschild. Um so you&nbsp;&nbsp; can if you're interested, you can look up James&nbsp; Goldmid and his relationship with the Rothschild.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so they're like a royal bloodline family going&nbsp; back to, you know, German royalty um and um some&nbsp;&nbsp; of the richest families of of Monaco. And um so&nbsp; they they use a lot of these mills um and they're&nbsp;&nbsp; ideal, right? Because it's really easy with&nbsp; access to chemicals to dispose of bodies. It runs&nbsp;&nbsp; through the night. It's usually an industrial&nbsp; area with not a lot of people around. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; noisy and so I went through a lot of torture and&nbsp; behavioral conditioning at that location as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely horrifying. I'm so sorry and I'm really&nbsp; grateful that you're shining a light on this so we&nbsp;&nbsp; can look at these photos and this location in a&nbsp; different light, you know, and and realize that&nbsp;&nbsp; if it happened to you when it did that there's&nbsp; still likely this type of abuse happening under&nbsp;&nbsp; there to children, you know, and if people are&nbsp; around that area, please pray over it. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; help share about it. Um share these photos and&nbsp; Kadia's story. Um, it's just really, it's sad how&nbsp;&nbsp; many different locations, especially underground,&nbsp; are used for these types of abuses. Um, so I'll&nbsp;&nbsp; scroll to the next photo. That's just one of many&nbsp; examples of some of the children's books that are&nbsp;&nbsp; written by Freemasons, uh, who are a part of this&nbsp; agenda to usher in the antichrist, to further the&nbsp;&nbsp; seed of Satan and their agenda. Robert Munch was&nbsp; used, Dr. Seuss was used, Harg Graves was used,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I just wanted to show this one um because this&nbsp; paper bag princess, you know, we have the dragon,&nbsp;&nbsp; we have um princess programming um that is done&nbsp; in the monarch program, you know, because those&nbsp;&nbsp; there are a lot of often um that's that's the&nbsp; whole purpose of Disney, right? the whole Disney&nbsp;&nbsp; princess is to to come under to come under the&nbsp; monarch parts that come under the jurisdiction of&nbsp;&nbsp; the monarch and even or the monarchy and even you&nbsp; know um Disney Disneyland or is it Disney World?&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh it's pro it may be both like but it might be&nbsp; one or the other is is own is actually under the&nbsp;&nbsp; jurisdiction of the crown. So they have their&nbsp; own sort of legal system and it's not actually&nbsp;&nbsp; uh Dominion of the United States. So So these&nbsp; books are used in programming to create parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a character in here that goes by the name&nbsp; Prince. like I have I have parts in my my bus&nbsp;&nbsp; um in K Town that go by these characters names&nbsp; uh because this was such a huge part of my head&nbsp;&nbsp; programmer's um formula in fracturing me through&nbsp; these processes of torture creating both of both&nbsp;&nbsp; these princess parts from books like this or&nbsp; stories uh Disney that do not have uh that have&nbsp;&nbsp; a very narrow uh scope of reality. um that so many&nbsp; of us healing from systematized abuse through mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control programming um are needing to bring&nbsp; into the surface and into the present to know&nbsp;&nbsp; that we're not under we're not under order anymore&nbsp; and we don't have to activate these programs that&nbsp;&nbsp; are causing illness or distress in the body or&nbsp; blocking memories and things. The last episode&nbsp;&nbsp; when you brought up Dr. Seuss that made like a&nbsp; huge splash with people and people are like no not&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. I love them as you know, but a lot of these&nbsp; these things that they popular popularize for&nbsp;&nbsp; children, Disney, you know, hard greaves, like&nbsp; you said, um books by Robert Munch, all these&nbsp;&nbsp; different um sort of things that they give our&nbsp; kids to to cling on to. It's just disgusting, you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, the meaning, the actual meanings behind it&nbsp; when you actually like really look at what is what&nbsp;&nbsp; the message is of of these different stories that&nbsp; they tell and then realizing the nefarious ways&nbsp;&nbsp; that they're used on children behind the scenes&nbsp; who go through these mind control programs. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; I I do appreciate you sharing that cuz there's a&nbsp; lot of parents that listen to these um channels&nbsp;&nbsp; and and interviews and want to be safer for&nbsp; their kids. And this is one way that they sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; sneak sneak programming and messages that can be&nbsp; actually really damaging to children into parents'&nbsp;&nbsp; hands because they get popularized as being really&nbsp; good and wholesome, you know. And so it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp; just good to know kind of the truth about some&nbsp; of these things and it's like who would ever who&nbsp;&nbsp; would ever guess so many of us grew up on all of&nbsp; these different stories and books and authors and&nbsp;&nbsp; you know thinking about them being Freemasons puts&nbsp; it in a different light and then also realizing&nbsp;&nbsp; that we shouldn't be supporting this because&nbsp; these are these are still likely being used today&nbsp;&nbsp; on children you know as programming scripts.&nbsp; Yeah. Yeah. And these parts often, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; they stay children, right, until they come to that&nbsp; place of healing and we can we can work with them,&nbsp;&nbsp; counsel them, minister them, get that trauma&nbsp; healing so then they can grow up and be the age of&nbsp;&nbsp; the body and then if it's ideal integrate. So they&nbsp; stay children and so they they have a lot they've&nbsp;&nbsp; believed lies, right? All of the programming is&nbsp; done. It's undone under torture, but there's a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of deception and a lot of theatrics that are&nbsp; done. There's a lot of staging and there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of theater um which I know most of us are aware&nbsp; of um excuse me I had I have a part um who was uh&nbsp;&nbsp; programmed um on the island of St. Thomas or the&nbsp; island of St. Thomas in the in the Virgin Islands,&nbsp;&nbsp; there was this big ship. There was an island. It's&nbsp; this like it's this whole staged shipwrecked thing&nbsp;&nbsp; and these Freemasons come and they they basically&nbsp; they strand you. They stay they they strand you.&nbsp;&nbsp; They they starve you and then they send this like&nbsp; theater on a pirate ship over full of all of these&nbsp;&nbsp; Freemasons acting like it's, you know, the Lord of&nbsp; the Flies. And they come and they will I will you&nbsp;&nbsp; know abuse the the damsel in distress or the child&nbsp; or the young woman who is being programmed who has&nbsp;&nbsp; been left on the island as a part of fulfilling&nbsp; their sick their sick fantasies but to also create&nbsp;&nbsp; um to also create further trauma uh for for parts&nbsp; like it's like Hollywood all of these stories you&nbsp;&nbsp; know Pirates of the Caribbean in it's all for&nbsp; these kinds of these kinds of programmings. My&nbsp;&nbsp; my part that had a severe eating disorder um and&nbsp; parts with eating disorders and then parts that&nbsp;&nbsp; would overeat. I it was a mystery for the longest&nbsp; time until these parts began to come forward and&nbsp;&nbsp; explain what had happened to them. These dynamics&nbsp; were created through um starvation um on in these&nbsp;&nbsp; shipwreck programs. Oh my goodness, that's&nbsp; horrifying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was a big&nbsp;&nbsp; key in that really broke something off me though.&nbsp; um when those memories came back, it explained so&nbsp;&nbsp; much and I you know and I've been able to verify&nbsp; and validate everything through research um dates,&nbsp;&nbsp; times, locations, getting that validation. I've&nbsp; heard that from so many different people who have&nbsp;&nbsp; come on the show and testified that they didn't&nbsp; most of their memories they had never heard of&nbsp;&nbsp; these locations or they had no memory of like&nbsp; reading these specific books or you know seeing&nbsp;&nbsp; these films or whatever it was and then they&nbsp; go look it up online and see that it's actually&nbsp;&nbsp; real like how you did you know looking up these&nbsp; locations that you remember this underground place&nbsp;&nbsp; these books these authors um and then being able&nbsp; to match them with with parts inside you you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; in different systems that that are are within&nbsp; you to be able to identify, oh, that's where&nbsp;&nbsp; this came from and that's what that name is from&nbsp; or that's where this this part is from and why it&nbsp;&nbsp; thinks the way that it does, you know. So, it&nbsp; is so validating and hopefully can help people&nbsp;&nbsp; on the other side of the screen too. Yeah, this&nbsp; is yeah, that's just a picture of the Empress uh&nbsp;&nbsp; the Empress Hotel um that I had mentioned um where&nbsp; I had stayed where some of the programming takes&nbsp;&nbsp; place for Monarch programming and it's owned&nbsp; by um that couple uh who owns Monarch schools.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh my gosh, it's actually really and it's known&nbsp; as being one of It's stunningly gorgeous. It's a&nbsp;&nbsp; famous hotel. It's known for being super haunted.&nbsp; Uh I was taken there. Uh I was taken there and uh&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah it was bad. A lot of there was a lot of like&nbsp; um there's a lot of uh electroshock torture that&nbsp;&nbsp; happened um in the like under the harbor under the&nbsp; Victoria Harbor where this hotel is. There are a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of military submarines that are under there.&nbsp; Um they're easy to research. That's an example of&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the things I was able to verify like down&nbsp; to the model of the submarine that I remember&nbsp;&nbsp; um which was actually just retired recently. The&nbsp; actual model of submarine has now been retired for&nbsp;&nbsp; a new and updated version. But there's a lot&nbsp; of programming, a lot of ritual abuse, a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of torture that happened um in the Victoria Harbor&nbsp; underwater. How horrifying. again like places that&nbsp;&nbsp; people I'm sure this hotel is like for example is&nbsp; somewhere that's like on people's destination list&nbsp;&nbsp; that they are just like so excited to go stay at&nbsp; or go tour just drive by you know and again it's&nbsp;&nbsp; just horrible how they invert you know some of the&nbsp; most beautiful things on the planet whether it's&nbsp;&nbsp; uh an actual location in nature or an something&nbsp; built some type of architecture um and how how&nbsp;&nbsp; much they do damage to it, you know, or&nbsp; the Vatican like what you've talked about,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, it really it kind of like you can&nbsp; look at it initially without knowing and and&nbsp;&nbsp; be wowed and awed by it, but then like this dark&nbsp; cloud comes over it that you can't really unsee,&nbsp;&nbsp; which I sort of experienced just looking at this&nbsp; initially whenever I looked at this hotel. I was&nbsp;&nbsp; like, "Wow, it's beautiful." But it's like you&nbsp; see the dark cloud within it as well. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of you almost see um you almost can like see&nbsp; and feel the evil that is within, you know. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's really sad that they do that. It's the other&nbsp; There's a hotel across the harbor to the U Ocean&nbsp;&nbsp; Point Resort. It's a Sherin uh Sherin's uh the&nbsp; Sherin hotel chain uh is also used uh as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's also part of the beast system seed of Satan&nbsp; project where people will come um it's the to&nbsp;&nbsp; that that the whole infrastructure is completely&nbsp; set up for programming for triggers. People are&nbsp;&nbsp; hired that are programmed very specifically. Um&nbsp; it's it's quite a seamless it's quite a seamless&nbsp;&nbsp; thing. But yeah, Sherin Hotels, including that&nbsp; one, that was part of my my experience. Wow.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the things that they did was they uh um in&nbsp; the electroshock torture in this specific location&nbsp;&nbsp; um that is the worst ab reaction that I experience&nbsp; is in my teeth. It's like it's wor it's a it's&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a pain worse than pain. It's like to have&nbsp; your teeth be electrocuted. But a a metal ball,&nbsp;&nbsp; electrode ball was placed in my mouth as I&nbsp; was being brutalized and tortured so that&nbsp;&nbsp; if I screamed or made any noise, that ball would&nbsp; activate and it would worsen the pain and it would&nbsp;&nbsp; actually because just there's something about the&nbsp; teeth. It's just oh my gosh, a demented hell of a&nbsp;&nbsp; pain beyond hell. Um and so sometimes I still&nbsp; experience that. um sensation and it's I just&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't even have words. Um but that's part of&nbsp; the silencing program where they teach you to&nbsp;&nbsp; endure symptoms, to endure pain, to endure torture&nbsp; because when you scream or make a noise, that ball&nbsp;&nbsp; in your mouth will activate and shock your teeth.&nbsp; So it's worse if you scream or cry. So you have&nbsp;&nbsp; to endure, you learn to endure it silently. And&nbsp; so that is one of the ways that a silent scream&nbsp;&nbsp; um might be created. And that silent scream, you&nbsp; know, it it needs to come out in order for that to&nbsp;&nbsp; heal. And it's really hard because the brain will&nbsp; rewire its neural circuitry, its neurons together&nbsp;&nbsp; to actually create to actually make it impossible&nbsp; to scream or to make noise because you're when&nbsp;&nbsp; you're in that situation, those neurons wire&nbsp; together. So pain equals silence, torture equals&nbsp;&nbsp; silence. And it becomes biologically hardwired. So&nbsp; there are so many people, Emma, that are walking&nbsp;&nbsp; around in this kind of excruciating torment&nbsp; and distress and and don't know why and don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know don't have words. They're not able to tell&nbsp; anyone. They're not able to express it. They may&nbsp;&nbsp; just have on a smiley face mask but are screaming&nbsp; underneath the surface. Um because of this kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of programming, it's incredibly diabolical but&nbsp; incredibly effective. Oh my gosh, thank you for&nbsp;&nbsp; sharing that. That's another maybe key for people&nbsp; if they've experienced that. I'm sure tooth pain&nbsp;&nbsp; is just in general, it's some of the worst pain&nbsp; that that you could ever go through. I can't even&nbsp;&nbsp; imagine the level of taking it to electroshock.&nbsp; I don't even I just can't. And it's just horrible&nbsp;&nbsp; that they're doing this to children, you know. But&nbsp; hopefully that's a it might be a puzzle piece for&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody who's experiencing that and maybe going&nbsp; to the dentist and being treated for something&nbsp;&nbsp; that you know is is a symptom of trauma instead&nbsp; of you know a symptom of of maybe just a general&nbsp;&nbsp; tooth ache or something like that you know. So,&nbsp; I I pray that that this can maybe be helpful for&nbsp;&nbsp; people on the other side of the screen, too,&nbsp; cuz I'm sure that if it's I'm sure that that&nbsp;&nbsp; those methods are used on a lot of children, you&nbsp; know, and it might not be something that somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; remembers right away. So, I really appreciate&nbsp; you sharing that. Yeah, of course. I hate that&nbsp;&nbsp; anyone else has had to go through it and and I&nbsp; know because of how how well this infrastructure&nbsp;&nbsp; is set up. They're just cycling kids through that&nbsp; like Monarch schools the whole you know it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp; for you know they they set up Monarch Schools as a&nbsp; sort of a charitable reach outreach for lowincome&nbsp;&nbsp; uh more vulnerable children in our societies.&nbsp; I mean, because they're already fractured&nbsp;&nbsp; and programmed and and easy to continue on that&nbsp; easier to work with to continue on a mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; process. You want a mind control slave. Um, you&nbsp; know, if you have an already fractured child,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, that's, you know, that's that's where they go&nbsp; and they look for them is for children below the&nbsp;&nbsp; poverty line. And so, it's really disgusting. Um,&nbsp; and then the the picture you have up the BC flag.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call British Columbia Atlantis. Um, it's this&nbsp; it's the seed of Satan project. And you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, that it's boasting its reigning crown&nbsp; system, the elusarian Illuminati sun worship. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; the surface of the earth now is 71% water. Um,&nbsp; and I I personally believe that is because of the&nbsp;&nbsp; increasing lawlessness that the Bible prophesies&nbsp; leading up to the return of Christ. And you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; some people refer to it as the Marine Kingdom&nbsp; Network um because Yeshua cast demons named&nbsp;&nbsp; Legion back to the sea in Mark 5. And we know a&nbsp; lot of free Masonic halls and clubs are called&nbsp;&nbsp; Legion Legions. And so that that submarine system&nbsp; there underwater is utilized by the military,&nbsp;&nbsp; the government uh and business executives for you&nbsp; know newer more sophisticated programs of of mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control. And so um you know I think that um yeah&nbsp; I think you know I have a personal theory. I think&nbsp;&nbsp; that the new world over here, you know, that&nbsp; a lot of programming took place on immigration&nbsp;&nbsp; ships when people came over here um into North&nbsp; America to establish the new world. Um it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp; my personal belief that um the new world order and&nbsp; the merchants um that are discussed in the book of&nbsp;&nbsp; Revelation that are judged for their exports is um&nbsp; North America. I I I think that a lot of people,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, it could be the Vatican, it could be&nbsp; this, it could be that, it could be, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of different theories about what that is.&nbsp; Um, but I think that a lot of a lot of programming&nbsp;&nbsp; took place on immigration ships over here to&nbsp; establish what they call the new world in order&nbsp;&nbsp; to carry the new world order through its exports&nbsp; through Hollywood, through the media, through,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, American television and basically&nbsp; disseminate um its lies and its propaganda and&nbsp;&nbsp; its deception, you know, to the rest of the world.&nbsp; And so, so the new world order as something that's&nbsp;&nbsp; coming, I think is a part of the strong delusion&nbsp; in 2 Thessalonians 2. I think we were born into&nbsp;&nbsp; um the new world order and that was it was&nbsp; actually you know established by you know&nbsp;&nbsp; you know I'm you know I'm in in my late 30s um so&nbsp; it was you know often you know so for me it would&nbsp;&nbsp; have been established around you know grandparents&nbsp; greatgrandparents that immigrated over here for me&nbsp;&nbsp; from Ireland um and so I think that these beast&nbsp; programs of mind control were established to&nbsp;&nbsp; make shells out of unaware people and that the&nbsp; veneer and this veneer of the society that most&nbsp;&nbsp; are conscious of the this so-called American dream&nbsp; and these upgrades and advancements um in you know&nbsp;&nbsp; submarine technology under the water here as is&nbsp; as you can see on the BC flag um you know these&nbsp;&nbsp; upgrades permitted the controlled opposition&nbsp; of um outdated MKLA program exposure and some&nbsp;&nbsp; payouts like the Canadian government there. There&nbsp; was exposure. There were payouts for mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; victims, but I think it was kind of like a&nbsp; controlled opposition thing. So, I'm here for&nbsp;&nbsp; the voices of those who are still trapped beneath&nbsp; these waters, these deep waters of judgment that&nbsp;&nbsp; um are coming like a flood from a throne of a&nbsp; loving God whose eye nothing escapes. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the thing everyone's waiting for, I think&nbsp; we're in it. I think that's the deception. We're&nbsp;&nbsp; all waiting for something we were born into. Um,&nbsp; and so, um, I'm grateful that there's there's an&nbsp;&nbsp; army of of righteousness that's rising and in an&nbsp; exodus towards hope, healing, and and redemption.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, because time is very short. And scripture&nbsp; says the dragon uh the dragon is is seeking&nbsp;&nbsp; um whom he may devour because Satan knows his&nbsp; time on this earth is short. And so this dragon&nbsp;&nbsp; programming through monarch through places like&nbsp; the Massie tunnel um is um is only growing as time&nbsp;&nbsp; goes on. And and thankfully, you know, we have all&nbsp; of these things have been prophesied and foretold&nbsp;&nbsp; of in scripture in and it's very clear. Um and&nbsp; so we we know that that there's an antidote. Thank you for sharing that. That's fascinating and&nbsp; horrifying all at once, but it actually makes a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of sense. And the iconography here is also&nbsp; interesting. I never really put it together in&nbsp;&nbsp; my head that like crowns also resemble the sun,&nbsp; which is kind of it's like neat to recognize that,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it also is, you know, it it's very occultic,&nbsp; you know, and again, something that's like&nbsp;&nbsp; celebrated and heralded. It's like, why even have&nbsp; a crown? But it's like, well, it makes it makes&nbsp;&nbsp; some sense if you think about it from occultic&nbsp; symbology, too. But that's really good insight for&nbsp;&nbsp; people to know and to sort of ponder. Oh, I just&nbsp; switched the screen. Indian residential school&nbsp;&nbsp; survivor on the Queen's alleged connection to&nbsp; missing children. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever&nbsp;&nbsp; you know the queen is, I wouldn't say it's a she,&nbsp; right? Um an it, more of an it. Um yeah, there is&nbsp;&nbsp; so much. Oh, there's there is so much um so there&nbsp; is just so much because these children are being&nbsp;&nbsp; gathered and collected and kidnapped to sacrifice&nbsp; to the dragon to empower the spirit of lawlessness&nbsp;&nbsp; and the spirit of the antichrist. And so there,&nbsp; you know, there's it's not hard to you don't have&nbsp;&nbsp; to do a lot of red stringing. It's hard hardly&nbsp; a conspiracy anymore, right? I have a guest that&nbsp;&nbsp; is reoccurring on my show from Canada named Kevin&nbsp; Annet who has been exposing Canadian residential&nbsp;&nbsp; and indigenous schools, the genocide that occurs&nbsp; in it. And he's he hasn't gone in depth about it,&nbsp;&nbsp; but he's mentioned, you know, that there's been&nbsp; allegations against the queen with that. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're helping to sort of connect some other dots&nbsp; from other people, too, and validate that. Um, and&nbsp;&nbsp; that's interesting that you found this headline&nbsp; for it. Yeah. Oh, that's just this picture here&nbsp;&nbsp; on the screen is is a is a picture of uh of a one&nbsp; one of many um men uh who were involved in um the&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm trying to think of a polite way to say this.&nbsp; There really isn't. And and quite frankly, I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; done being polite, but the but very demented and&nbsp; defiling pornography, including snuff films. And&nbsp;&nbsp; so, um, I was both in the films as a participant&nbsp; as well as, um, trained as a videographer, um,&nbsp;&nbsp; on professional film cameras to have to film these&nbsp; things. And, uh, this is a this is a photo of of&nbsp;&nbsp; the the man and he's doing, as you can see, if&nbsp; you look up uh, Freemason or Masonic hand signals,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, this is what they do. So, this was the photo&nbsp; that was put um in the newspaper or in the 70s&nbsp;&nbsp; when he first established what is a guitar factory&nbsp; in Vancouver. And I was trafficked to this guitar&nbsp;&nbsp; factory, taken to meet this uh person at uh at&nbsp; night um by a photographer that my school sent me&nbsp;&nbsp; with on a work practicum because I was an aspiring&nbsp; photographer. So I was 15 years old. I was doing a&nbsp;&nbsp; work placement with this photographer already.&nbsp; Huge red flag. teenage girl alone in the car&nbsp;&nbsp; with a man. Um, so he took me to this man. Um, and&nbsp; this guitar factory ended up being a location for&nbsp;&nbsp; um a very lucrative uh industry of of pornography&nbsp; in some of the most uh perverse and um yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; it was it was hard. It was I don't even have&nbsp; words. Um yeah. So that's but that's an example&nbsp;&nbsp; that I mean this photo is a photo of him taken&nbsp; in the 70s when he established um these guitars.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so that was a huge center for both trafficking&nbsp; and and pornographic uh films. Oh my gosh, that's&nbsp;&nbsp; horrific. Including including SNAF. So yeah. Yeah.&nbsp; so terrible that people don't understand that&nbsp;&nbsp; these things exist, you know, and like I mean you&nbsp; look at you look at him, we can't see his face,&nbsp;&nbsp; but he just looks like a normal person like just&nbsp; wearing a t-shirt and like he doesn't fit like&nbsp;&nbsp; what we'd think oh predator predator, you know,&nbsp; like it just looks like a normal dude that just&nbsp;&nbsp; like, you know, hangs out at dive bars and like&nbsp; plays in a band. Like that's what it looks like,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know? It's crazy that these people just&nbsp; walk among us and we have no idea. And they&nbsp;&nbsp; do and they did a lot of like side projects too&nbsp; in the programming as well. It wasn't just for&nbsp;&nbsp; u like pornography. And you can see that signal&nbsp; through you could you could see that signaled&nbsp;&nbsp; through the hand. You can come here. This is&nbsp; where you can come. You can you know bring this&nbsp;&nbsp; this person. You have a mind control slave. You&nbsp; can bring them here for this programming. A lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of us were taught uh musical skills, uh different&nbsp; things, um in order to be able to do and perform&nbsp;&nbsp; certain fetishes or acts for certain members of&nbsp; the the the brotherhood. Um and so music it music&nbsp;&nbsp; and in programming is is a really big part of&nbsp; it as well as developing particular skills and&nbsp;&nbsp; talents. And so it wasn't totally random that&nbsp; it was a guitar factory. So this is a picture&nbsp;&nbsp; that you just put on. This green hallway um is&nbsp; in the uh Halley Research Center of Antarctica.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um which is one of the laboratories for crisper&nbsp; technology that I was flown to. Um a part of me,&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean it was me. I have a part named January who&nbsp; is my Antarctica part. And so uh so she was taken&nbsp;&nbsp; there both as a subject for crisper technology&nbsp; and hybrid experiences as a remote womb and&nbsp;&nbsp; gestation for the seed of the beast. Um but I also&nbsp; worked uh as a laboratory assistant. uh January&nbsp;&nbsp; um was being trained in molecular uh biology um in&nbsp; Antarctica and it was at both this Holly research&nbsp;&nbsp; center and the Roth era research center as well.&nbsp; Um, and that information came forth because I kept&nbsp;&nbsp; having flashbacks of being in Antarctica with a&nbsp; particular program programmer having landed on a&nbsp;&nbsp; helicopter at the top of the hill looking down at&nbsp; what I was able to identify eventually on research&nbsp;&nbsp; as the Ruther Research Center. And I was wearing&nbsp; uh this orange these orange suits. I kept having&nbsp;&nbsp; these memories of these orange suits. And so I&nbsp; I started to do research and and um established&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. So, I was wearing a cold water immersion&nbsp; suit. I immersion suit um in these memories and&nbsp;&nbsp; um so then I began to look at okay, why was&nbsp; I wearing a cold water immersion suit? What&nbsp;&nbsp; is this for? Um and I didn't get very far um until&nbsp; uh this part was ready to come forward and divulge&nbsp;&nbsp; um some things that I will be releasing um in&nbsp; in my book. Um I have to wait for the fullness&nbsp;&nbsp; of the testimony and some other things to be esta&nbsp; established to um to share further details of what&nbsp;&nbsp; happened. Um there's also the Spalbard seed vault&nbsp; that's in Antarctica as well where there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of like experiments in um like biod like just a&nbsp; lot of you know they say it's just for the protect&nbsp;&nbsp; they're studying they're studying the earth they&nbsp; say they're just studying biodiversity they're&nbsp;&nbsp; you know they're studying the ozone lay the ozone&nbsp; layer they're studying the environment up there&nbsp;&nbsp; it's not it's just a highly classified projects&nbsp; and they have very specific tours to protect tend&nbsp;&nbsp; to give the public a sense of openness about&nbsp; what's really happening at these centers. But&nbsp;&nbsp; they're actually uh creating monsters in these&nbsp; laboratories both in and outside of the wombs of&nbsp;&nbsp; uh young girls um and monarch slaves. And um&nbsp; that's what I'm going to one of the things I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; going to be writing about. And here's an example&nbsp; of uh another hallway. So the last hallway you saw&nbsp;&nbsp; was create was um painted in a very specific shade&nbsp; of green um that's used in the color programming&nbsp;&nbsp; in order to activate a certain part. So, this&nbsp; is a public restroom um that I just discovered&nbsp;&nbsp; on happen stance that is a uh a place to um bring&nbsp; children um who are programmed to sexually abuse&nbsp;&nbsp; them in these spaces. Because if you have a a if&nbsp; if somebody's in the cult and they have a child&nbsp;&nbsp; who has been in this color programming, then&nbsp; this color programming is is activating this&nbsp;&nbsp; part to come forward and to receive the sexual&nbsp; trauma or to perform the sexual trauma and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh not remember it because it's a a part a&nbsp; dissociative part. And so I saw this bathroom&nbsp;&nbsp; and I just I walked into one of the stalls and I&nbsp; sat down and I began to weep and I just began to&nbsp;&nbsp; pray and just pray and just weep and pray and um&nbsp; and so this is just a really common thing. Um I&nbsp;&nbsp; don't know how many bathrooms there are that are&nbsp; painted in this specific color. Um, but one of the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh people who programmed me uh chose this paint&nbsp; color for another member of my family's kitchen&nbsp;&nbsp; to in order to keep that programming software&nbsp; reactivated um in this other member of the cult. Oh my gosh, these it's just so funky. Like&nbsp; it's hard. It almost look just looks like&nbsp;&nbsp; a center for children or some type of like,&nbsp; you know, fun house for kids. Like this is&nbsp;&nbsp; weird to think that adults would paint it this&nbsp; color for something professional. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it definitely has that vibe of mind control. And&nbsp; especially the specific colors that they chose,&nbsp;&nbsp; like you said, were no accident. It was for an&nbsp; intended purpose. It was. and and and just you&nbsp;&nbsp; know just just to be you know I have to say as&nbsp; as like it took my breath away when I saw this&nbsp;&nbsp; hallway of bathrooms. I was just at the beach. I&nbsp; walk in and I just like I could hardly breathe. I&nbsp;&nbsp; was just it took my breath away um cuz that was&nbsp; very triggering for me. But because it did not&nbsp;&nbsp; co it did not cause me to switch. So I was able&nbsp; to have that moment of healing in that bathroom&nbsp;&nbsp; stall. I didn't switch into my color programmed&nbsp; part because the word of Yahw and his grace and&nbsp;&nbsp; love has broken that down with his truth and&nbsp; he's renewing my mind and he's not giving me a&nbsp;&nbsp; spirit of fear. He's given me a sound mind. And&nbsp; so now, you know, I could walk into a situation&nbsp;&nbsp; like that and I I'm supposed to be programmed with&nbsp; that color. like in Antarctica, I walk down that&nbsp;&nbsp; hallway to go to do my task and I'm supposed to&nbsp; switch into January. But instead, I was able to&nbsp;&nbsp; be co-conscious of January and grieve with her&nbsp; and and um and and just pray in that space and&nbsp;&nbsp; and not be triggered into a dissociative state,&nbsp; but actually minister to this part of my soul.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's really amazing, too, that you&nbsp; were able to get actual photos. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; sure that there's not a lot of um things&nbsp; online where they're showcasing this. No, but if you see a color, if you see like a color&nbsp; that color in a dentist in in a dental office&nbsp;&nbsp; or a or a um any kind of institution run because&nbsp; that is there for uh that is there to make sure&nbsp;&nbsp; that their employees programmed parts come out&nbsp; to perform their tasks without them knowing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; um or even the patrons of such a such a a business&nbsp; or an institute. Um so that gate that so I just&nbsp;&nbsp; was showing some examples in these pictures here&nbsp; that you see of just an unnecessary amount of&nbsp;&nbsp; security around this bathroom. There's like bars,&nbsp; extra doors, extra dead bolts, and extra locks,&nbsp;&nbsp; which would lead me to believe that this bathroom&nbsp; isn't just um some cult member. Um and this would&nbsp;&nbsp; signal this is a very high cult community that&nbsp; this bathroom is here just as coming in with a ch&nbsp;&nbsp; with a child to abuse them. But the but this would&nbsp; facility would actually be used and locked up and&nbsp;&nbsp; um things programming would happen within within&nbsp; this bathroom. Everything is painted green too.&nbsp;&nbsp; The countertops things that I I didn't even&nbsp; picture there. Um I didn't take pictures I&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't give pictures of all of it but it's all&nbsp; painted in that color. And you'll see they've lo&nbsp;&nbsp; they they keep it like a prison. Oh my gosh.&nbsp; Yeah. That is so bizarre. That is so weird.&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like it should be some like piece&nbsp; of art or something. Just looks so out of&nbsp;&nbsp; place. Yeah. Public bathroom. Dead bolts. Yeah.&nbsp; Yeah. Like why is that why is that necessary? Yeah. That's okay. So in this picture you see&nbsp; so that is a lo the logo on the coat of an oral&nbsp;&nbsp; surgeon in the monarch program in his office.&nbsp; He has a big painting of Felix the cat that's&nbsp;&nbsp; all pixelated just like this logo you see on&nbsp; his shirt of a pixelated face. This represents&nbsp;&nbsp; fracturing the one's identity, right? Your face,&nbsp; your identity. And the pixelation represents the&nbsp;&nbsp; fracturing, the programming and these, I call it&nbsp; software that is installed through ritual torture.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so this oral surgeon when I went in at 19&nbsp; to have my wisdom teeth taken out um gave me a&nbsp;&nbsp; tetrototoxin. Um and uh this is what I believe it&nbsp; was because the anesthetic put me into a state of&nbsp;&nbsp; paralysis but full awareness. So I could not move,&nbsp; speak, but I could feel all of the pain of all of&nbsp;&nbsp; the things that he was doing to me. And he was&nbsp; very very very sadist sadistic and would um and&nbsp;&nbsp; he had uh electrodes hooked up from my brain to a&nbsp; monitor so he could see because I couldn't scream&nbsp;&nbsp; or move. He could see the level of pain that I&nbsp; was going through as he was administering certain&nbsp;&nbsp; types of torture including rape. He he got off on&nbsp; the pain the more pain I was in. And he would ask&nbsp;&nbsp; me I could hear him asking right and I can't move.&nbsp; I could hear him asking me how does this feel? How&nbsp;&nbsp; does this feel? Like it was so sick and so uh&nbsp; demented that I actually wrote a letter to him&nbsp;&nbsp; recently um anonymously to tell him I know what&nbsp; he does. I know what he is about. I remember and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh that he better repent because he is he is&nbsp; under the wrath of Yah. And um you know it was&nbsp;&nbsp; really therapeutic to write it. uh so therapeutic&nbsp; to write it that I didn't mail it but I might. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; and this part this is the personality that that&nbsp; took this traumas her name is Molina and so&nbsp;&nbsp; um uh it's still traumatic just for me even to&nbsp; go to the dentist. um this part makes it really&nbsp;&nbsp; hard to make it to the appointment and I never&nbsp; understood why for the longest time. Um you know&nbsp;&nbsp; until until I did. And was this the is this&nbsp; the the same dentist who would have you were&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about your teeth earlier and the ball that&nbsp; would go in your mouth. Was that was that any of&nbsp;&nbsp; that happened at the office or was that separate?&nbsp; Completely separate. This was a one-time occasion,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it was especially horrific what he did. Um,&nbsp; the electricity that he did, it was a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; like electrocuting like probes of electrocuting&nbsp; rape in every orifice. Um, and then sealed off,&nbsp;&nbsp; uh, you know, with his own, you know, getting off&nbsp; on it all. Yeah. Yeah. So, it wasn't scary enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh my gosh. Yeah. When I looked him up, when the&nbsp; memories came back in, um I I when I looked him up&nbsp;&nbsp; and I saw his website and I saw this logo logo,&nbsp; I mean, he's very, you know, does very well. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; when I saw this picture of him with that logo,&nbsp; again, this is the type of confirmation that I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about when I have memories and and I want&nbsp; to validate them. You just do a little research.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, here's the guy I remember. Okay. Yep. Here's&nbsp; his website. Oh, Monarch program. Look, look at&nbsp;&nbsp; he's got butterflies all over his waiting room.&nbsp; You know, look at this. Look at that. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's just all of these validating things. Not that&nbsp; that's necessary in order to for your memories to&nbsp;&nbsp; be valid, but it does, you know, it does help&nbsp; and it it's pretty interesting. the I was also&nbsp;&nbsp; uh I was also um the dental and the orthodont&nbsp; the orthodontist or oral surgeon industry is&nbsp;&nbsp; really just um I mean I think that there's a&nbsp; reason the high sui one of the highest suicide&nbsp;&nbsp; rates as far as careers are concerned as a dentist&nbsp; because there's the omega programming which is the&nbsp;&nbsp; suicide programming um that is is created in the&nbsp; event that something goes wrong or somebody's is&nbsp;&nbsp; disobedient or wants to get out. Um because these&nbsp; dentists have access to anesthetic and I worked&nbsp;&nbsp; for an orthodontist. I nannied for his family. I&nbsp; I looked after his daughter for 10 years. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp; this was a a job that was set up by my handler. Um&nbsp; and so he was a big part of of of my programming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and he um um, as it turned out, hired me&nbsp; to actually I thought I was just nannying um,&nbsp;&nbsp; for the family, but uh, because I was a slave&nbsp; of this cult um, he had actually hired me to&nbsp;&nbsp; participate in programming his young daughter.&nbsp; Um, which is really which is really hard um,&nbsp;&nbsp; to um, reconcile. Um, yeah. Oh my gosh, this is&nbsp; all just so eye opening what you're sharing. And&nbsp;&nbsp; this was this dentist is separate from the other&nbsp; photos that we were showing of the green facility.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was there anything else from Antarctica that you&nbsp; wanted to share? Not yet. Yeah, I think that's&nbsp;&nbsp; good for now. Um, well, I will share. Okay, so I&nbsp; will share. There is a huge huge huge huge huge&nbsp;&nbsp; huge seed vault of genetic seed uh bloodline&nbsp; seed um pertaining to the Trump family. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and so a lot of my um, involvement there, um, was&nbsp; overseeing and monitoring and creating petri dish&nbsp;&nbsp; embryos, um, for the lucky chosen of the&nbsp; cult who would receive um, would receive&nbsp;&nbsp; an implantation that they would believe was a&nbsp; natural pregnancy between them and their spouse,&nbsp;&nbsp; but grafted in to the the genes uh between the the&nbsp; the um the helix uh the helix on the mom's side,&nbsp;&nbsp; the helix on the dad's side, and then you have&nbsp; the helix from like a hybrid or a bloodline&nbsp;&nbsp; family like Trump would be grafted in just like&nbsp; Hit, you know, the Nazis have been doing this&nbsp;&nbsp; forever. This is a big thing that Hitler was all&nbsp; about. He wanted to create all kinds of little&nbsp;&nbsp; Hitlers. And so he so the Nazis were really big on&nbsp; experimenting on how to impregnate as many women&nbsp;&nbsp; as possible with the seed of Hitler. And so that's&nbsp; a big part of this this spirit of the Antichrist.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so there are a ton of people walking around&nbsp; uh who have um Trump genetics that have no idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't mean they're not biologically their&nbsp; their parents that they know. Um, but they would&nbsp;&nbsp; graft they would graft in an extra helix um in&nbsp; these laboratories in order to spread the seed&nbsp;&nbsp; of Satan or the seed of Lucifer or the seed of&nbsp; the beast, however you want to look at it. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and this is not new. The the the fallen ones or&nbsp; the Nephilim have been teaching humankind to do&nbsp;&nbsp; this um, you know, since the beginning. read the&nbsp; book of Jeremiah, the book of Jude. Um I have a&nbsp;&nbsp; picture on the slideshow here that anyone can&nbsp; screenshot um coming up of biblical references&nbsp;&nbsp; um so that uh you we can see this is this is not&nbsp; just something that is being made up. This is the&nbsp;&nbsp; state of hum of our world from the beginning.&nbsp; this war has been going on. And there it is&nbsp;&nbsp; for anybody watching. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Take&nbsp; a picture for sure. Uh can the Canaanites in&nbsp;&nbsp; scripture were trafficked um you know humankind&nbsp; is just depraved um is just depraved um without&nbsp;&nbsp; you know a compass of righteousness that that I I&nbsp; really believe you know we find in his word and um you know uh I really recommend looking these&nbsp; up. you'll find them fascinating. Um Jeremiah&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 talks about how the rich are the devourers&nbsp; of children and that devouring of children is&nbsp;&nbsp; a judgment for turning aside from Yahw because&nbsp; iniquity only increases and multiplies itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sin begets sin. Um, Zechariah 11:17 talks about,&nbsp; you know, Freemason style shepherds, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; who who who have these weird swords and rituals&nbsp; pertaining to their right eye um and their arms&nbsp;&nbsp; that you seem masons today making hand signals&nbsp; with. Um Jeremiah 57:3 talks about people who&nbsp;&nbsp; sacrifice their children among the oak trees.&nbsp; Well, we know Bohemian Grove and oak trees are&nbsp;&nbsp; a huge part of free Masonic culture. Um Isaiah&nbsp; 57 goes on to talk about um those who slaughter&nbsp;&nbsp; their children under ravines, under clefts and&nbsp; crags. Um, a lot of today's Masonic buildings,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, measurements and themes visually pertained&nbsp; to Solomon's temple. Um, some still use certain&nbsp;&nbsp; specifications like that um, based on 1 Chronicles&nbsp; 22, 2 Chronicles 20. Um, and um, and and and&nbsp;&nbsp; they insire themselves in their own net. And Yah&nbsp; according to um Psalm 9 avenges all of this blood&nbsp;&nbsp; that is spilled. And he does not ignore the cries&nbsp; of the afflicted. And he says that he is known by&nbsp;&nbsp; his acts of justice and that these specific wicked&nbsp; people are ins snared by the works of their hands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, Leviticus talks about wizards being&nbsp; put to death who are giving seed to moolak,&nbsp;&nbsp; drinking blood, using enchantments. Um, it's all&nbsp; in the word. We don't we don't need as as much as&nbsp;&nbsp; like podcasts and documentaries. All of these are&nbsp; so valuable and continue to be valuable in my life&nbsp;&nbsp; and in the lives of many. It's, you know, it's all&nbsp; in the word. There's nothing new under the sun as&nbsp;&nbsp; it says in Ecclesiastes. And so, and so I wanted&nbsp; to put these scriptures forth because if all of&nbsp;&nbsp; this is true and it's still going on and it has&nbsp; always been, then there is an antidote. And and&nbsp;&nbsp; the antidote isn't just found in the word, it&nbsp; is the word itself. It is alive. And so I just&nbsp;&nbsp; really encourage people to get into it and see if&nbsp; these things are true because if this is true then&nbsp;&nbsp; um everything else that is written in this book&nbsp; is as well. And there's good news as horrific as&nbsp;&nbsp; all of this is. There's a lot of good news. Yes,&nbsp; there is. And another survivor that you mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp; earlier, Nathan Reynolds, he also speaks on,&nbsp; and I I don't remember if it's the exact same&nbsp;&nbsp; um scriptures that you picked out here, but&nbsp; he's been a big advocate for sharing different&nbsp;&nbsp; um scriptures and passages of where SR, did um&nbsp; you know, human sacrifice, these different things&nbsp;&nbsp; existed in the Bible and that that we can, like&nbsp; you said, go back in time and see it. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa Meister has talked about um that a little bit&nbsp; on some of her shows. So, I mean, there are we are&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of seeing the world through a different lens.&nbsp; And I think the reason why people currently have&nbsp;&nbsp; not is because the lack of knowledge on did SRRA,&nbsp; mind control. They just don't know what they're&nbsp;&nbsp; reading. Where when you learn about this stuff&nbsp; and then you go back to the Bible and look, you&nbsp;&nbsp; can sort of see see it clear as day that there's&nbsp; that there's multiple examples. and you gave a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of them. So, I do encourage people to do their own&nbsp; research, take a screenshot, go check it out. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; do you have any episodes or I know your podcast&nbsp; isn't up. Um, have you done a podcast on anybody&nbsp;&nbsp; else's show that has gone through some of these&nbsp; more in depth? Not yet. Uh, would love to do&nbsp;&nbsp; that at some time. It would be awesome because&nbsp; this just scratches the surface. Even this list&nbsp;&nbsp; of scriptures there, that's just the tip of the&nbsp; iceberg. There there are far more references. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; but if you want to subscribe to our our YouTube&nbsp; channel, um, uh, right now we just have the music&nbsp;&nbsp; and, um, we may release something like that in&nbsp; the future. Um, and so if if you're curious on&nbsp;&nbsp; staying tuned, um, you can, um, there's a passage&nbsp; in the book of wisdom, and I I don't quote the&nbsp;&nbsp; book of wisdom. It's by King Solomon. I don't&nbsp; I don't quote this as the inspired word of Yah,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the writings of antiquity are super valid,&nbsp; as a historical account of what was happening&nbsp;&nbsp; then. It's happening now. And it says here, I&nbsp; have I have a quote um that I just wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp; share because this was written in between the&nbsp; first first century BC and first century AD.&nbsp;&nbsp; It says, "For your judgments, for Yahw's judgments&nbsp; are great and hard to interpret. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp; undisiplined souls went astray." Now, listen this.&nbsp; Tell me if you think this sounds like a did or a a&nbsp;&nbsp; fractured soul to you with amnesic barriers.&nbsp; It says, "For when lawless men had supposed&nbsp;&nbsp; that they held a holy nation in their power, they&nbsp; prisoners of darkness and bound in the feathers&nbsp;&nbsp; of a long night, kept close beneath their roofs,&nbsp; lay exiled from the eternal providence. For while&nbsp;&nbsp; they thought that they were unseen in their secret&nbsp; sins, they were divided from one another by a dark&nbsp;&nbsp; curtain of forgetfulness, stricken with terrible&nbsp; awe and very troubled by apparitions. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; it sounds a lot like somebody going through like&nbsp; the torment of a mental illness or schizophrenia&nbsp;&nbsp; or somebody who's just really suffering and&nbsp; and doesn't understand why. It could be a dark&nbsp;&nbsp; curtain of forgetfulness through trauma, through&nbsp; these very sadistic means that are generationally&nbsp;&nbsp; practiced and handed down through um through many&nbsp; generations. And then it says, "For neither did&nbsp;&nbsp; the dark recesses that held them guard them from&nbsp; their fears, but terrifying sounds rang around&nbsp;&nbsp; them, and dismal phantoms appeared with unsmiling&nbsp; faces." And it goes on. I mean, so the book of&nbsp;&nbsp; wisdom is really interesting and it talks about&nbsp; this, I believe, exactly what we're talking about&nbsp;&nbsp; today. Wow. That would be kind of a an interesting&nbsp; episode to do with you sometime to pour focus into&nbsp;&nbsp; just that topic. I think listeners would be really&nbsp; curious to learn about that too. So maybe we could&nbsp;&nbsp; plan doing that sometime, you know, and and&nbsp; like do a real deep dive into the ones that you&nbsp;&nbsp; provided today, which I hope that you guys took&nbsp; a screenshot of. if not go back and do it. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and then you know any others that you want to add&nbsp; to it? We could sort of spend some time looking&nbsp;&nbsp; at them through a different lens. That would be&nbsp; great. It would be that would be I would be such&nbsp;&nbsp; a blessing. I'd love to dig in deeper. Uh cuz, you&nbsp; know, these, you know, wisdom book of wisdom even&nbsp;&nbsp; talks about dragons, the worshiping of dragons&nbsp; and uh irrational reptiles and, you know, um&nbsp;&nbsp; Jasher and Enoch as well. And then of course, you&nbsp; know, all all through scripture. It would be good&nbsp;&nbsp; to it would be good to do an episode. I'd love to&nbsp; explore and dig into more of why all of this is&nbsp;&nbsp; taking place. Um because it's really important um&nbsp; that we thoroughly understand the world in which&nbsp;&nbsp; we live in. Amen. Let's talk about that after.&nbsp; Maybe we can look at the schedule and and plan&nbsp;&nbsp; something in the, you know, near future in the&nbsp; next couple months and do a deep dive. That would&nbsp;&nbsp; be great. And for this episode, was there anything&nbsp; that we didn't cover that you wanted to share? Um, I think that was we covered so much. you know,&nbsp; I'm there's still questions that I'm sure people&nbsp;&nbsp; are going to have and there's like so many&nbsp; different, you know, more conversations that&nbsp;&nbsp; we could probably have about all the stuff that&nbsp; we talked about today. So, maybe we do a part&nbsp;&nbsp; three of your testimony and we can take questions&nbsp; from people and and maybe dive a little bit deeper&nbsp;&nbsp; into some of the stuff that we talked about&nbsp; towards the end. Um, and then we can plan an&nbsp;&nbsp; episode to do a biblical deep dive too and sort&nbsp; of uncover what our eyes haven't seen, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; or what most people haven't. And now that we have&nbsp; sort of a renewed way that we look at the world,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, it would be really interesting to do that and&nbsp; maybe do some Q&amp;A for people who have questions&nbsp;&nbsp; for you. That would be awesome. I I would that&nbsp; would be great. uh would be just a joy to talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about this because the more we understand it, the&nbsp; more common we realize it is and the more people&nbsp;&nbsp; can discover um the salvation uh that we really&nbsp; need that has been so well hidden from us. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp; and maybe we could talk to a little bit about&nbsp; um some children's games that were used uh in&nbsp;&nbsp; programming as well. Um, I'm not sure I have heard&nbsp; not I, you know, I don't listen to a ton. Um, but&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't I haven't heard uh how children's games&nbsp; like Hungry Hippo, Trouble, and Sorry have been&nbsp;&nbsp; used in programming. They were used in mine. A&nbsp; lot of these games were developed through military&nbsp;&nbsp; um veterans by military veterans. And so maybe&nbsp; we could talk about um Hungry Hippo or I could&nbsp;&nbsp; call it I like to call it Hungry Hippo campus and&nbsp; what it means to lose your marbles. Oh my gosh,&nbsp;&nbsp; what a pun. Holy smokes. Yes, that would be really&nbsp; really valuable. Again, people are trying to move&nbsp;&nbsp; away from the things that they have access to&nbsp; in real life, movies, music, um facilities,&nbsp;&nbsp; businesses. I think this could be another way&nbsp; too that we could educate parents, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I think that would be really fascinating or&nbsp; video games, you know, I think there's so many&nbsp;&nbsp; different ways that what you went through in this&nbsp; actual program, you know, affects children that&nbsp;&nbsp; are outside of it in the real life. They've&nbsp; they've duplicated that in actual, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; society, too. A lot of these things. So, it'd be&nbsp; really good to spend some time going through some&nbsp;&nbsp; of that and helping shine a light on, you know,&nbsp; for survivors, too, who might have gone through&nbsp;&nbsp; that and might not remember or might not be clear&nbsp; or might have not not have talked about it yet. I&nbsp;&nbsp; actually haven't heard of these games being used.&nbsp; So, it would be a new topic for for listeners as&nbsp;&nbsp; well to to hear about and learn about. So, let's&nbsp; definitely plan, you know, at least a couple more&nbsp;&nbsp; episodes and we can do some deep dives into&nbsp; some of this stuff. Cool. Awesome. Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp; I appreciate today. I appreciate you. You shared&nbsp; so much and so much of this was I know just like&nbsp;&nbsp; the hardest things in life to talk about, you&nbsp; know, and the fact that you are able to bear your&nbsp;&nbsp; soul the way that you do, emotions and all exactly&nbsp; authentic to who you are and to share it in a way&nbsp;&nbsp; that that the audience can be touched by it and&nbsp; can hear the reality of these things. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; the details of of your children to the details&nbsp; of programming and locations and um you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; how these things are are presented to our children&nbsp; in the form of books and entertainment, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I just really appreciate your candid and&nbsp; honest uh education that you give us on your&nbsp;&nbsp; experiences and on these things. And then I&nbsp; also really appreciate you always always and I&nbsp;&nbsp; don't know if you do this I think you just do this&nbsp; naturally but you the hardest things that you talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about by the end of it people feel hope you spin&nbsp; things around to be very hopeful to be positive&nbsp;&nbsp; to have wisdom behind it lessons that we can learn&nbsp; ways that we can keep going when we feel like we&nbsp;&nbsp; want to give up um and you do that in in in a way&nbsp; that I think and wish that more people would would&nbsp;&nbsp; look at life, you know. So, I think the more that&nbsp; that we sort of listen to these situations and how&nbsp;&nbsp; you and others have overcome them, you know, we're&nbsp; giving people hope, too. So, I really appreciate&nbsp;&nbsp; you sharing all this and then also bringing up&nbsp; shining the light on it in a way where we can take&nbsp;&nbsp; something meaningful away from it that can benefit&nbsp; us, whether it's education or a tool for healing&nbsp;&nbsp; it. Um, you know, or just a different perspective&nbsp; to look at how we can switch something like shame&nbsp;&nbsp; around, you know, and and and take away a positive&nbsp; from it.
