So, so I was there at that moment<00:55:19.200><c> and</c><00:55:19.440><c> I</c><00:55:19.680><c> think</c><00:55:19.839><c> God</c><00:55:20.160><c> put</c><00:55:20.319><c> me</c><00:55:20.559><c> there</c><00:55:20.800><c> at</c> moment and I think God put me there at moment and I think God put me there at that<00:55:21.359><c> moment</c><00:55:21.839><c> when</c><00:55:22.880><c> uh</c><00:55:23.119><c> Russia</c><00:55:23.680><c> was</c> that moment when uh Russia was that moment when uh Russia was rebuilding<00:55:25.200><c> and</c><00:55:25.599><c> and</c><00:55:26.079><c> casting</c><00:55:26.640><c> off</c><00:55:27.200><c> all</c><00:55:27.599><c> the</c> rebuilding and and casting off all the rebuilding and and casting off all the all<00:55:28.400><c> the</c><00:55:28.720><c> former</c><00:55:29.920><c> uh</c><00:55:30.160><c> systems</c><00:55:30.640><c> that</c><00:55:30.960><c> didn't</c> all the former uh systems that didn't all the former uh systems that didn't work<00:55:31.599><c> and</c><00:55:31.920><c> looking</c><00:55:32.160><c> for</c><00:55:32.400><c> new</c><00:55:32.640><c> ones.</c><00:55:33.680><c> So</c><00:55:34.400><c> um</c><00:55:35.440><c> uh</c> work and looking for new ones. So um uh work and looking for new ones. So um uh the<00:55:35.760><c> citizens</c><00:55:36.319><c> tribunal</c><00:55:37.520><c> they</c><00:55:37.760><c> were</c><00:55:37.920><c> open</c><00:55:38.160><c> for</c> the citizens tribunal they were open for the citizens tribunal they were open for that<00:55:38.720><c> they</c><00:55:38.960><c> they</c><00:55:39.280><c> needed</c><00:55:39.680><c> some</c><00:55:40.079><c> structure.</c><00:55:40.880><c> So</c> that they they needed some structure. So that they they needed some structure. So as<00:55:41.359><c> as</c><00:55:41.760><c> Russia</c><00:55:42.240><c> rebuilt</c><00:55:42.720><c> from</c><00:55:43.040><c> nothing</c><00:55:43.920><c> this</c> as as Russia rebuilt from nothing this as as Russia rebuilt from nothing this became<00:55:44.559><c> part</c><00:55:44.800><c> of</c><00:55:44.960><c> it</c><00:55:45.119><c> and</c><00:55:45.359><c> it's</c><00:55:45.680><c> and</c><00:55:45.920><c> it's</c> became part of it and it's and it's became part of it and it's and it's still<00:55:46.480><c> part</c><00:55:46.720><c> of</c><00:55:46.880><c> it.</c><00:55:47.440><c> So</c><00:55:48.000><c> um</c><00:55:48.319><c> but</c><00:55:48.480><c> that</c><00:55:48.880><c> and</c> still part of it.
