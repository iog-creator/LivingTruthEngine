00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.240
What's up you guys? Welcome to the imagination.&nbsp;
I'm your host, Emma, and today I'm honored to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.480
back on the show once again, podcast regular,&nbsp;
United Church minister, turned whistleblower,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.560
Canadian hero, humanitarian, loving father,&nbsp;
published writer and author, public speaker&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.520
and podcaster, documentary filmmaker, Nobel Peace&nbsp;
Prize nominee, co-founder of the international&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.720
tribunal into crimes of church and state,&nbsp;
righteous soul, and eagle strong voice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.040
Kevin Annet. In case you've missed any of Kevin's&nbsp;
past episodes or our movie night feature where we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.320
aired his acclaimed documentary, Unrepentant&nbsp;
on this channel, here's a brief intro into his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.080
testimony and background along with some helpful&nbsp;
information on what we'll be talking about today.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.040
Kevin's early life was shaped by compassion and&nbsp;
a call to serve as a United Church minister in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:59.600
Port Alurnie, British Columbia in the early&nbsp;
1990s. their indigenous survivors of Canada's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.240
residential schools revealed a hidden genocide,&nbsp;
abuse, forced sterilizations, and child deaths&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.520
orchestrated by church and state. Kevin's refusal&nbsp;
to stay silent led to his 1997 defrocking, a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.000
historic first for political reasons. Undeterred,&nbsp;
he documented survivors stories and produced the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.280
2006 documentary Unrepentant, which exposed these&nbsp;
atrocities and helped prompt Canada's 2008 apology&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.760
to indigenous survivors. His investigations&nbsp;
reached global elites, including the Vatican,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.640
leading him to co-found the International Tribunal&nbsp;
into Crimes of Church and State in 2010. His work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.360
with the International Common Law Court of Justice&nbsp;
contributed to Pope Benedict's 2013 resignation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.360
a historic event linked to allegations of&nbsp;
church crime. Despite facing smear campaigns,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.480
death threats, and blacklisting, Kevin has&nbsp;
earned Nobel Peace Prize nominations for his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.880
relentless pursuit of justice. Through his radio&nbsp;
program, Here We Stand, in the Republic of Canada,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.040
a movement for self-governance under common law,&nbsp;
Kevin has inspired thousands to reject centralized&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.760
power. His tireless advocacy from indigenous&nbsp;
communities to international tribunals amplifies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.640
the marginalized and challenges the powerful. Now&nbsp;
in books he's written like Truthteller Shield,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.440
a manual for whistleblowers and Hellraisers,&nbsp;
the theory and practice of letting your truth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.480
and the truth prevail, which is a powerful manual&nbsp;
for empowering whistleblowers and truth tellers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.880
and another book, Governing Ourselves, a handbook&nbsp;
on personal, political, and spiritual sovereignty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.760
which we will be discussing and referring to&nbsp;
today. Kevin distills his decades of struggle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.080
into a powerful guide for liberation. Co-authored&nbsp;
with indigenous elders, legal scholars, and global&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.520
activists, the book is both a manifesto&nbsp;
and a practical blueprint. It argues that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.200
true freedom begins with reclaiming personal&nbsp;
agency, rejecting corporate and state control,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.960
and embracing spiritual awakening. Drawing on the&nbsp;
Republic of Canada's experiments with common law&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.160
courts and citizens assemblies, this book offers&nbsp;
tools for building self-governing communities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.400
rooted in equality and mutual accountability. It&nbsp;
is a call to action, urging readers to embody the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.200
principle that we are beholden to none, save one&nbsp;
another, and the laws we establish. Kevin's life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.640
is a testament to the power of one individual&nbsp;
to ignite change. From a small church in Port Al&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.320
Bernie to a global stage, he has exposed truths&nbsp;
that shook empires and inspired a movement for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.800
sovereignty. As Kevin continues to lead by&nbsp;
example, his story reminds us that courage,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.360
truth, and solidarity can dismantle even the&nbsp;
most entrenched systems of oppression. In a world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.560
hungry for freedom, Kevin stands as a beacon,&nbsp;
showing us how to govern ourselves and build a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.000
future worthy of our highest aspirations. Before&nbsp;
wrapping up the introduction of today's guest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.160
I'd like to give just a couple quick reminders and&nbsp;

streaming platforms such as Rumble and X following&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.480
the extreme censorship that caused my last YouTube&nbsp;
channel to be terminated. I've just started a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.280
is crucial to continue sharing vital information&nbsp;
with the public and disclosure communities. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.560
thank you all on the other side of the screen&nbsp;

honor. Voice for the voiceless, relentless victim&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.560
and survivor advocate, passionate purveyor of&nbsp;
truth, content creator, author and writer, human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.560
rights activist, absolute warrior, and a man whose&nbsp;
actions speak louder than any words. The one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.000
the only Kevin Annit. Kevin, thank you so much for&nbsp;
being here with us again today. It's always such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000
an honor to have you on. Oh, it's always a joy to&nbsp;
be back. Thank you, Emma. You're so welcome. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.360
excited for for today's topic and you know, we've&nbsp;
had some really great podcast episodes. The thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.840
I was telling you before we started recording&nbsp;
that I really love about working with you is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.560
you're so knowledgeable about so much. So, there's&nbsp;
so much that we can talk about whether it's as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:12.080
big picture or sort of a focused detail. And so,&nbsp;
today I'm really excited for this conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.400
And I think it's really going to help people&nbsp;
feel empowered to take their sovereignty into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.840
their own hands and to sort of have a direction on&nbsp;
how to do that. So I thought maybe we could start&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.200
um you're actually working with some groups right&nbsp;
now helping produce and manifest in real life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.440
this exact topic that we're talking about today&nbsp;
personal and um sovereignty throughout a nation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.840
or throughout a community. And so I thought I&nbsp;
would give you an opportunity to share a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.840
bit about that because it's really revolutionary&nbsp;
what you're doing. Well, in what other more and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:51.680
more people are doing um in two places in America&nbsp;
and England this last month there's been a real&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.440
coalescing of people who some of whom we inspired&nbsp;
but other people have just come forward. It's kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.960
of like this hundth monkey phenomenon. People have&nbsp;
just come from everywhere all of a sudden and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.480
mean that is reflected in the fact that we sold&nbsp;
over 1,200 of my books in the last two months.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:13.920
normally in the same period of time would sell&nbsp;
maybe 50 or 100. So it's going through the roof&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.640
now this interest and yeah you you mentioned this&nbsp;
book and they both both in America and England&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:26.400
these new groups are relying heavily on this. I'll&nbsp;
tell you about them. First of all, uh in England&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.360
for a number of years, people have been trying to&nbsp;
they've shown kind of a passive interest in what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:38.320
we're doing in Canada because we're facing the&nbsp;
same uh institution of the crown, right? And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:44.000
last month, a organizing committee has formed&nbsp;
to establish a republic, sovereign republic in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.120
England called the Republic of Albon. Albio N.&nbsp;
And uh that's a traditional Gaelic word. It kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:57.040
of embraces a lot of the culture there and um it&nbsp;
also reflects the fact that historically there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.560
was a republic in England. It's in under Cromwell&nbsp;
and the Puritans when they cut off the c the head&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:09.840
of the king Charles um in 1649 for 11 years they&nbsp;
had a republic. Parliament abolished the monarchy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.120
and the house of lords and said it was a crime of&nbsp;
treason to reestablish the British monarchy. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:21.760
um, Charles II comes along, does a military coup,&nbsp;
overthrows the republic, and reestablishes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:28.320
monarchy, but it was never a dour or lawful power.&nbsp;
It was kind of a de facto coup, but it it's never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.680
had, in other words, the British crown has not&nbsp;
had lawful authority since 1649. It's a power,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:38.880
but not a lawful one. And that really helped us&nbsp;
when we set up the Republican Kennetic as we said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.120
look, it's always been a fiction, literally&nbsp;
the authority of the crown. Well, the folks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.520
in England, they've now reached a critical mass&nbsp;
and they now have organizing committees in four&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.800
different areas in Ireland because there is&nbsp;
kind of a cultural and historical affinity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.800 --> 00:09:00.800
in the north of Ireland, um Scotland, Wales, and&nbsp;
England. Okay? And they they have a flag uh which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.880
they're just uh I'll send it to you later. You can&nbsp;
post it. We uh they're just in the process of kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:14.560
of finalizing it, but it'll have the symbols&nbsp;
of those four cultures on it. and um uh they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:22.720
have agreed to very much follow the setting kind&nbsp;
of the outline we did in Canada which is they've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:28.560
uh decided on a constitution they're going to go&nbsp;
public and say look this is not just replacing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.480
figurehead uh knocking out a king and putting&nbsp;
in a president right this is an transformation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.320
from the grassroots so they're they'll be setting&nbsp;
up as we did uh local republic assemblies courts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.080
um their own sheriffs to enforce it, making&nbsp;
the appeal to people to switch allegiance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:51.440
nullify their oath of allegiance to Charles&nbsp;
and the crown and take it to constitution. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.840
reviving the republic, that's in their tradition.&nbsp;
As a matter of fact, it was interesting because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:02.080
after the republic got overthrown, a lot of those&nbsp;
folks came to came to America to New England.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.200
Um it was interesting early on people know the&nbsp;
story of the Mayflower landing at Plymouth Rock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:16.640
in 1620. 50 years following that uh there were um&nbsp;
people who used to be in the new model army who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:23.120
fought with Cromwell who had come over refugees&nbsp;
from England and these folks wrote out the early&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:28.160
statements in Connecticut and Plymouth of what&nbsp;
their republic should look like. that is they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.120
formed the first covenant the first real identity&nbsp;
the new identity people had that we are Americans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.400
because we are governing ourselves we're not&nbsp;
beholden to any ruler any monarch you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:44.800
um and so there was that continuity you know from&nbsp;
England to America and the same thing's happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:52.320
now because part two of this is in America there&nbsp;
is uh now we're in touch with people in uh 14&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:57.280
different states who are interested in this and&nbsp;
what they're doing is they want to issue a new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:05.520
Declaration of Independence against the existing&nbsp;
system and they've they've united Democrats and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.920
Republicans because they've lost the old labels.&nbsp;
These are Americans who are saying one of the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.320
people had at one of these meetings I took part&nbsp;
in on a Zoom call. They had a big flag on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.920
wall that said neither Republican nor Democrat but&nbsp;
American going back to the roots of who we all are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.240
and making that that unity again. And people are&nbsp;
so hungering for that, right? and um you know this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.920
divisive conflict that's been going on. people now&nbsp;
in America are saying we need a new declaration to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.760
remind us of what to recover our soul to remind&nbsp;
us at the heart of America is the fact that not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.960
only are all people created equal but they remain&nbsp;
equal and they've got to establish their own way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:49.680
to govern themselves in in the law in politics in&nbsp;
everything so that all the citizens are involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.960
that you know for example there should be no laws&nbsp;
passed in which we haven't had a say the best laws&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.560
come out of our own communities where people get&nbsp;
together and say what do we want how do we want&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.880
our communities to be and work that away from the&nbsp;
grassroots. So it's really exciting. They want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.720
issue this. They haven't set a date but they're&nbsp;
they're holding like what happened in 1770s. U&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.440
they're holding constitutional conventions all&nbsp;
over and they're making an appeal to people to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.560
come out from these labels of Republican Democrat.&nbsp;
Forget about the politicians no matter who they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.640
are. This is not an attack on anyone. It's an&nbsp;
a reminder of America is a lot more than its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:30.400
politicians or its government. It's in the heart&nbsp;
and soul of the people and we're trying to recover&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.040
that soul. So it was beautiful. I was had tears&nbsp;
in my eyes after talking to these folks because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.320
it's like you know finally it's happening where&nbsp;
it should because I still believe that America&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:46.000
and what it embodies is the hope of the world in&nbsp;
the sense that you know the common law republic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.160
was a fact here. It wasn't just an nice nice idea.&nbsp;
It's it's it keeps rising up through slavery and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:59.440
through all of these wrong turns that the country&nbsp;
took. There's this this kind of gyroscope that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.480
keeps bringing us back on course all the time,&nbsp;
right? It and and and that's a sign that the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.720
world needs in this age of the corportocracy.&nbsp;
It's either a republic or this corporate monolith&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:15.520
that's at the heart of all of these problems and&nbsp;
crimes we've been talking about. So, those are two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:19.920
really exciting developments. And um of course,&nbsp;
they want me to come over to England in the fall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:25.360
and I'll be down in the States as well helping&nbsp;
with all this. But, oh my gosh, it's really great.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:30.320
me. I love that people are finding your work and&nbsp;
starting to learn about these things. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:36.800
I can't believe that this stuff isn't common&nbsp;
knowledge to people living in society. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.520
people are just now finding out about this decades&nbsp;
into their life and saying, "Oh, wait. I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.760
have to accept what's always been there. I can&nbsp;
use my voice and get a group of people together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:51.760
and make a change." And I really love that you're&nbsp;
being brought in on behalf of um these different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.600
movements especially that have to do with politics&nbsp;
because unfortunately you know politics I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.840
was rooted in maybe doing something good and&nbsp;
creating law and order. However, throughout time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:09.760
and and especially now, the only purpose it really&nbsp;
serves is to get people to hate one another. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.560
it creates these little pockets of division and&nbsp;
really compartmentalizes people from their own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:19.120
communities, you know, and then they get so caught&nbsp;
up in idolizing these people that don't know them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:24.080
that don't give a crap about them, you know, and&nbsp;
and ultimately we're destroying ourselves from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:30.000
the inside out because these policies have been&nbsp;
so inverted to work against us, you know. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.800
I really love that you're seeing people sick of&nbsp;
that and saying, "What are we doing?" You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:40.960
let's all unite together in our own communities&nbsp;
and and as a nation and throw out these different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:45.440
divisive tactics. We're better together. And&nbsp;
that really says a lot about your work and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:50.160
way that you've presented it that way. Right. And&nbsp;
that's, you know, the power of this book and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.520
the folks in America and England both said the&nbsp;
same thing about this even though they hadn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.320
been in communication. They're all just observing&nbsp;
this that the power of this it combines all three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:04.080
personal political spiritual and I go into detail&nbsp;
of what that looks like and not just me there was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:09.120
this was actually co-written with five other&nbsp;
people people in our republic movement in in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:14.160
also from other countries uh you know like&nbsp;
Tom House he's a traditional Ojiway elder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:20.000
who I've known for many years who is sits on&nbsp;
the national council of the republic in Canada&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.240
um and so when you said politics the you know&nbsp;
in here We explain that the word comes from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:33.200
Greek word polus p o l i s and all that meant in&nbsp;
in the Greek language was the city because they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:39.760
were referring to Athens which was the first place&nbsp;
in the world that people practice participatory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.480
democracy not representative where you sign your&nbsp;
authority away to one guy and he does whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:50.560
he wants and you only have a say you know at the&nbsp;
next election. Somebody did a funny cartoon. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:56.320
shows a guy in a holding up a piece of paper paper&nbsp;
and there's 10 X's on it and he says here's your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:02.880
lifetime ration of democracy, right? 10 crosses&nbsp;
every time you vote. And Jeanjac Rouso in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:09.840
social contract in the 1700s he wrote that he said&nbsp;
in the English system of representative democracy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.080
you only have a moment of freedom when you choose&nbsp;
somebody but then you lose freedom again because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:20.160
they are representing you right that's not&nbsp;
the Athenian model. 500 years before Christ,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.960
they had a model in ancient Athens which&nbsp;
was better than what we brought now. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:31.120
first of all, every citizen was expected to&nbsp;
participate. So they had big assemblies and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:37.760
um now of course citizen meant the non-slaves&nbsp;
and women of course weren't included. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:44.480
so there's that. But in terms of their world,&nbsp;
all of the males had the right and and duty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.120
not just the right, but the obligation to attend&nbsp;
these big assemblies where they were pass laws and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:55.440
they would all take turns in being the archon,&nbsp;
which was like the the lawmaker. Um, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.640
and to enforce the laws and to sit in the courts&nbsp;
and everything. So, you draw lots and say, "Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.800
Emma's the judge this month." Okay. No, you&nbsp;
got to take that responsibility. That way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.720
it's always shared. It's equalized, right? the&nbsp;
responsibility and the power. And not only that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:16.560
but we get the word ostracize, okay, from this&nbsp;
Greek word ostrachon. And that was a little piece&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:21.200
of pottery. And whenever they didn't like somebody&nbsp;
who was in power, they'd write his name on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:28.000
ostrachon and vote him out. He'd be ostracized. He&nbsp;
would be removed from office. He was accountable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.120
at all times. So it was kind of like a contract.&nbsp;
You have a contract with somebody. You say, "Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:38.640
I'll do this if you do this." But if either side&nbsp;
violates a contract, boom, you can walk. It's null&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:44.960
on board right away. That's the way government&nbsp;
should be. You know, um if if people have voted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:50.640
somebody to we don't use the word representative&nbsp;
in the Republic of Canada. We we say delegate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:55.280
because they're delegated to do a job by the&nbsp;
people. If they don't do the job, the people go,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.720
you're out. Because the power resides, like any&nbsp;
American who reads their constitutions knows,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.120
the power resides in the people. There isn't a&nbsp;
government separate from the will of the people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:11.440
People combine and create a government and they&nbsp;
can remove it at any time. That's the simple idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:17.200
that that we're reviving in in people that that&nbsp;
memory, right? Um and so we go into the detail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:24.080
first about the political and um there there's you&nbsp;
know the personal spiritual is is other aspects we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:31.120
can talk about as well. Absolutely. I wanted you&nbsp;
to I would love for people to purchase this book.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:36.000
Um, one thing I really love about your books,&nbsp;
and I mentioned this to you before we came on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.840
you don't write books leading people to different&nbsp;
cliffhers of keep buying, keep buying, depend on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:48.720
me to give you, you know, to lead you to where you&nbsp;
need to be. You write the literal blueprints of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:54.000
how somebody can empower themselves 100% and not&nbsp;
need anybody to do so in your books. And I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.520
this one is a really great example of about that.&nbsp;
And I wanted you to just maybe share anything else&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.960
that you wanted people to know about it because&nbsp;
I think this is a really important one especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:08.880
because you do cover the personal, political, and&nbsp;
spiritual aspects of our sovereignty. And this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.360
on Amazon for people listening. Um you can get it&nbsp;
from Kevin's website, too. It'll take you right to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:18.560
the Amazon page. Um I'll link both and and we'll&nbsp;
have a couple other book recommendations too on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:24.000
these topics for you guys. Right. So the uh we&nbsp;
start in the book with the political because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.320
that kind of affects everybody. But part two is&nbsp;
spiritual sovereignty. And the example I use to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.200
best understand this because everyone it's kind&nbsp;
of a funny term. I make a distinction in the book&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:42.320
between religion and spirituality. And I say well&nbsp;
religion is kind of like comparing religion and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:50.880
spirituality is if if uh spirit which is from&nbsp;
the Greek word numa breath right it's inherent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.560
in all of us. But religion is kind of like the&nbsp;
weather report describing the wind, right? It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:02.640
it's describing something all the time. And and&nbsp;
it comes from the a word in Latin meaning to tie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.840
people together religion. So it's it's this kind&nbsp;
of a natural bringing everyone together in one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:15.840
kind of group. I mean that's like a a how empires&nbsp;
operate, right? But spirit is inherent within all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:21.760
of us like our rights, like you know the common&nbsp;
law, all of that. And by analogy in America,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.720
the way it happened was remember I mentioned&nbsp;
the folks who came over from England as kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:34.160
refugees when the monarchy was reestablished. They&nbsp;
were instrumental in in um the first principle was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:40.800
in our because we were seeking their independence&nbsp;
as a spiritual communities, right? Uh the Puritans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.520
and others, they didn't want a king or a pope.&nbsp;
They they believed in Christ as the head of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:49.520
the church. And to practice that they set up&nbsp;
their own self-governing congregations where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.880
they would elect their own minister, right? And&nbsp;
like Baptists today in America, they do the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.760
thing. You can as a you see this all the time.&nbsp;
You don't need a theological education. There's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:04.160
no church hierarchy. Every congregation, every&nbsp;
community governs themselves and they elect their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:10.400
own minister, right? Um that was the model among&nbsp;
the Puritans in the 1600s when they're up there in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:15.200
New England. Well, naturally the political system&nbsp;
evolved out of that because in their town meetings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.520
and everything, they said, "Well, we're we govern&nbsp;
ourselves spiritually. Why wouldn't we politically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:26.000
as well?" So, when you have that sense that we're&nbsp;
all endowed by the creator with the same nature,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.280
right? We're all part of that oneness, why would&nbsp;
we have a hierarchy? We don't have a hierarchy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:37.200
spiritually. Why would we have one politically&nbsp;
and invest all power in a few people like who can,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.880
you know, pass laws without a permission, write&nbsp;
executive orders, and everybody has to go along&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:47.200
with it? That's got nothing to do with true&nbsp;
self-governance and what America's all about. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:53.840
it it evolved naturally from the spiritual&nbsp;
sovereign into the political. And uh the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.840 --> 00:22:01.440
personal is a a harder one in a way to deal with.&nbsp;
Um, let me we'll get into that, but let me just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:07.200
if you have any comments or questions about any of&nbsp;
that. Yeah, I would love to get more into it. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.200
before we do, um, I wanted to bring up a couple&nbsp;
other book recommendations that we were going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:17.040
share real quick. Um, just on these topics,&nbsp;
um, because again, I think I think your work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.920
is really important and it's so affordable. It's&nbsp;
right here on Amazon. People can get it in just a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:27.760
couple days. Um, and so I would love to just help&nbsp;
set up people for, you know, that for that freedom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:32.080
and sovereignty and to learn more about it. So I&nbsp;
thought maybe if you wanted to just talk a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.920
bit about the case for for Canada and then also&nbsp;
the whistleblowers manual real quick and then we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:43.920
can dig deeper into topics into personal we'll go&nbsp;
back to the personal sovereignty because that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:52.240
really important one. Um, okay. Yeah. Case for&nbsp;
Canada. So this was uh in 2015 in January we had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:58.880
convention in Winnipeg over 200 delegates about a&nbsp;
third of them indigenous people and we established&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:03.600
the framework like what they're doing right now&nbsp;
in England there had creating a constitution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:10.160
which really embodies the vision of what the&nbsp;
republic should be and um we adopted originally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:15.280
we had a flag with an eagle on a tree and then&nbsp;
the native people said well what about the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:22.080
row wampam now the two wampam was the first&nbsp;
original treaty between the eastern woodland&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:28.720
natives and the Europeans when they came over. And&nbsp;
the Europeans needed the natives in the east, both&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:33.280
in America and Canada, because they were important&nbsp;
in the fur trade. They were military allies when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:38.320
the French and the English were fighting each&nbsp;
other. And so it was expedient for the Europeans&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:44.720
to sign this treaty. And but what it said is that&nbsp;
these two represent the the blue lines represent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.640
the Europeans and the indigenous going down&nbsp;
the river together. One in their own ship, one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:53.280
in their own canoe. And that was the notion that&nbsp;
we will share the land together. It won't be one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:59.280
over another. Right now the Europeans went against&nbsp;
that. They broke that covenant with the natives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:06.320
of course. Um like in America they said natives&nbsp;
are just like they still say they're um they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.600
like dependencies on the there's only America&nbsp;
law and we don't recognize native sovereignty&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:16.400
or anything like that. And in Canada is worse&nbsp;
because they're all wards of the crown which means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:22.480
they don't even have legal status. They're not&nbsp;
citizens. So Europeans kind of abregated that but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:28.080
indigen the traditional native people still hold&nbsp;
to it and say our vision is that we will share&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:33.040
the land together and that's what the Republic&nbsp;
of Canada is. It's the model for it is it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:41.600
federation of different sovereign nations within&nbsp;
the one umbrella of Canada and um that and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:47.120
three stars represent the English, the French and&nbsp;
the indigenous founding nations. So in the book we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:55.200
lay out how we put that vision into practice with&nbsp;
the assemblies. Um also training people and that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:59.920
why you know I'm so glad about the show today&nbsp;
because I hope we can use it as a practical kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:06.240
of training school. uh like this a visual manual&nbsp;
of what we're talking about with people who've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:14.240
gone from the 90% of people who are still watching&nbsp;
and and kind of not sure to the minority who are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:20.800
taking the next step to organize and put this into&nbsp;
practice. And what we saying here all the time is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.440
uh you have to understand your own history as a&nbsp;
people. Not what you get taught in school but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:31.200
living history. And we've described that like we&nbsp;
go into detail about like there was an attempted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:36.720
rebellion in Canada against the crown in 1837 and&nbsp;
it got defeated. It's one of the reasons the crown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:43.040
and the church has had such power here. Um but&nbsp;
all of that is again based on a fraudulent power&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.000
called the crown. We can revoke and step out of&nbsp;
it at any point. And we we give people a kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.800
how-to process of of just like we do in the common&nbsp;
law training manual about how to set up a common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:58.160
law court. We showed you how on the ground you can&nbsp;
do this. And we've had some really great times,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:03.840
some fun times. Like for example, uh when we&nbsp;
formed the assembly in Vancouver, we went out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.160
uh and did a flag raising. We had a bag piper. It&nbsp;
was so stirring. It was a Scottish in me coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:13.120
out, right? It just brought tears to my eyes. This&nbsp;
bag piper was playing. There was a whole group of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:18.480
us there and we brought down the Canadian flag&nbsp;
and raised the Republic of Canada flag, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.480
And then there was about two dozen people there&nbsp;
uh who were newcomers. They all in unison took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:31.120
the oath of allegiance to the republic. So they&nbsp;
revoked their their allegiance to Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:37.120
and her descendants and the Canadian government&nbsp;
and laws and we took it to the the republic and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:42.000
they signed their citizenship cards. And at that&nbsp;
point they operated within their own jurisdiction&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.880
and that is so powerful when people do that&nbsp;
together because then they say okay we have an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.280
obligation to protect each other now to work with&nbsp;
each other. It's kind of a glue that brings people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:56.960
together rather than just another idea floating&nbsp;
around the internet that never like I say it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:06.800
uh ideas by themselves are like steam okay it&nbsp;
dissipates all over u but but a when you're doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:14.320
u the republic and the common courts you need a&nbsp;
piston to move the steam so the rather the steam&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:19.040
moves the piston that's you bring together the&nbsp;
vision the spirit with the practical organization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.840
And then you get movement. But you can't&nbsp;
have it without with steam or a piston on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:29.760
on them by themselves. Don't do it. You need&nbsp;
their combination. And that's how we view this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:34.560
work. You know, the ideas are the first step in&nbsp;
the discussion, but it's got to lead to these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:40.560
practical operations. You know, so we're thinking&nbsp;
I say to people, don't think theoretically&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.360
anymore. Think operationally, right? And think of&nbsp;
how you're going to put it into operation in your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:52.720
own neighborhood. Absolutely. And then we have&nbsp;
gone over this one in depth on um on a another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:57.520
episode. Um but this is one of my favorite books&nbsp;
just because it really fits the theme over all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.720
this podcast and people listening, but I think it&nbsp;
also definitely complements the topic today which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:09.040
is your whistleblower manual. Yeah. Well, I mean,&nbsp;
I had fun writing it because I was just drawing on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:16.240
my own experience and writing it in a very kind of&nbsp;
basic way for people. So, that um honestly, okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:22.320
we're dealing with big institutions and that's to&nbsp;
our advantage because they have a set way they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.840
operate, but we can maneuver. We have the freedom&nbsp;
to to outmaneuver them. And here's how you do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.800
And I kind of lead it through. first thing they're&nbsp;
going to do if you're ever targeted for anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:37.280
uh and you you hold some evidence or some&nbsp;
important information that they don't want coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:42.160
out, the first thing they're going to do to you is&nbsp;
is it's all about silence in you. So, they don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:48.400
want to get too heavy because that draws more&nbsp;
attention to you. So, they seduce you by saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:53.440
um, oh, we can work this out. Uh, just don't go&nbsp;
to the press. We can work this out. Now, most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:57.760
people want to do that. They don't want to have a&nbsp;
confrontation. If they think they can, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.800
work it out with any hassle, they will. What? And&nbsp;
that that's what happened to me. They said, "Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:08.320
let's negotiate." When they fired me without cause&nbsp;
highlighted these disappeared children and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:13.200
land deals and everything going on, the land theft&nbsp;
by the church and big money and the government,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:18.240
they said they we went into negotiation, but&nbsp;
all that did stretched out over four months. At&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:23.760
the end, they canled the negotiations. It was&nbsp;
just designed to tie me up so that I couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:29.280
go public with stuff. And that gave them the&nbsp;
time to destroy evidence, silence witnesses,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.960
arrange their own narrative so that when I&nbsp;
did go public, they could say, "Oh yeah, well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:38.320
we've we know about, you know, Kevin, he's got a&nbsp;
bad history, blah, blah, blah." They had all their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:43.920
PR guys in place. They needed time to do that.&nbsp;
So, what I say to people in here is that whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:49.520
you're you're holding important evidence and&nbsp;
you're willing to go public with it, just do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:53.760
Don't wait for anybody else. Don't rely on&nbsp;
your adversary to do the right thing because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:53.760 --> 00:30:00.320
they never will. They're they have two priorities&nbsp;
in a corporation whether it's church, government,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:10.320
business, anybody. Um efficiency and growth,&nbsp;
right? They have to hold on and these are machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.640
priorities not human priorities, right? and uh&nbsp;
they have to sustain themselves and people you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.000
know inconvenient whistleblowers or whoever get&nbsp;
in the way of that. So they have a whole protocol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.920
that we've learned about how they deal with people&nbsp;
like us. And so we go into all the lessons of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:31.120
and of course Sunsu and the art of war. I say to&nbsp;
people, if you really want an education, go to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:38.400
the back of this book and read the 50 points, the&nbsp;
excerpts from SunSu. And um you know, you'll learn&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:44.560
a lot right there because uh something as basic&nbsp;
as never operate on the terrain of your enemy or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:49.840
you've lost the battle. And that's what everybody&nbsp;
does. When you get upset, what do you do? You have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:56.240
a protest. Well, they're ready for protests.&nbsp;
They want protests, you know, because you're,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.360
no matter how angry or determined people are,&nbsp;
you're still asking for something from somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:05.840
in authority and all they have to do is ignore you&nbsp;
and there goes your power. But if you don't worry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:10.960
about asking like we did eventually after many&nbsp;
mistakes and years of struggle on this, we said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.360
"Okay, well, we'll set up our commonal courts&nbsp;
and put you guys on trial. Now you have to answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:21.840
this." And look at the disproportionate effect.&nbsp;
Two dozen of us force out the truth in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:27.360
We go on to force rat singinger out of power&nbsp;
because they don't know what to do when you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:34.400
taking the initiative all the time and you know&nbsp;
it's always basic strategy that you have to hold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:40.480
that initiative at all time and set the train of&nbsp;
battle and do everything on your terms and that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.080
in a way kind of leads us to the whole issue of&nbsp;
personal sovereignty because that's difficult for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:49.040
people because we haven't learned that we haven't&nbsp;
learned how to govern ourselves yet but this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:54.080
one of the ways you learn by learning. You know,&nbsp;
the best teacher is a black eye, right? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:59.360
you learn from it. And as long as you don't&nbsp;
give up and it's a tragedy when people give up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:04.640
because then how do they apply all the brutality&nbsp;
they've been through? How do you pass it on to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.880
the people if you're just going to crawl away and&nbsp;
die somewhere? So, we can't do that. We've got to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:15.440
share at all times what we've been through with&nbsp;
each other, right? 100%. Yes. And like I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:20.480
these books are all on Amazon. I would highly&nbsp;
recommend purchasing them and especially if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:26.000
you guys know other people who are are sort of&nbsp;
thought leaders like you. These make really great&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.400
gifts or recommendations also and they support&nbsp;
Kevin so he can keep doing this work. So these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:37.680
are all on Amazon. Um the truth tellers shield&nbsp;
the whistleblower manual. Um like I said that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.080
one can really apply to to anybody and everybody&nbsp;
watching this channel. I think that's something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:47.440
that's a theme throughout every single episode&nbsp;
is is that courage and sometimes there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:51.840
to learn in the hardest things that we could ever&nbsp;
go through and these conversations demonstrate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:57.840
that and hearing Kevin's personal experience um&nbsp;
is really inspiring for what he's learned as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:04.160
whistleblower and they're very positive things.&nbsp;
And we also just did an episode with Juliet Engel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:11.360
Um that was really along those lines also on that&nbsp;
personal sovereignty and and whistleblowing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:16.160
lessons learned and how to keep going. So I'm&nbsp;
going to have that episode linked below. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.240
guys missed that one, definitely go back and watch&nbsp;
it. It was a really beautiful episode. But Kevin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:28.480
let's talk more about the personal aspect of&nbsp;
this. Right. So, um, we're raised in a culture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.840
that's very atomized and individualized. So, we&nbsp;
talk about individual rights like they're an end&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:41.600
in themselves rather than just part of a bigger&nbsp;
collective. And um the the genius of the American&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:48.720
Constitution was that they balance both. Like it&nbsp;
said, we have unalienable liberties. Nobody can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:53.840
can take those from you. They're born in you, but&nbsp;
they only exist when you practice them. But you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:58.560
don't practice them in isolation from everybody&nbsp;
else because I mean the the best quote about that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:06.640
was right as the Civil War was starting in 1861.&nbsp;
Abraham Lincoln um let me read this. He said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:11.440
"Many of our countrymen speak of liberty and we&nbsp;
are much in want of a proper definition of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:16.320
word. Some men see liberty as a right to do&nbsp;
what they will with themselves while others&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:21.040
see it as a right to do what they will with&nbsp;
other men." Referring to slavery. Right? Here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:25.440
we have two different and mutually exclusive&nbsp;
understandings of the same word yet each side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:31.040
calling it the same thing, liberty. Right? So&nbsp;
when people say freedom, what are they talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:36.000
about? Is it like my freedom to do whatever&nbsp;
I want? No. Uh in the French Constitution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.520
in the French Revolution, they said in 1792, they&nbsp;
said freedom is the right to do anything that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:49.680
doesn't harm another. Okay? So that's a simple&nbsp;
thing. your right doesn't then boom cross over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.920
somebody else's right and then it's not a right&nbsp;
it's a privilege and I experienced that when we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:59.040
formed the first assemblies um because in some&nbsp;
of these communities the people were fairly well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:04.560
off I remember we had a on Vancouver Island in a&nbsp;
place called Parksville we had a meeting in this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:10.000
guy's it was a mansion it was like a really big&nbsp;
big house and a lot of these other people were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.960
either retired or they had professions they had&nbsp;
good careers but they were upset about the COVID&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:20.080
restrictions Right. And they didn't want to have&nbsp;
the restrictions. And I said, "Well, actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.920
these restrictions have been on a lot of people."&nbsp;
And they they said, "What do you mean?" I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:29.520
"Oh, well, native people under the Indian Act, you&nbsp;
can't refuse medical treatment. Like since 1874,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:34.720
it's been like that in Canada." Um, they had to&nbsp;
have special passes to leave the reservation or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:39.120
they' go to jail. And they still operate under&nbsp;
that. And they're all sitting there. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:42.400
but what does that have to do with CO? And I&nbsp;
said, "Well, why do you think they can get away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.880
with CO?" because they were trying it out on&nbsp;
all these other groups. So, we've got to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.960
beyond our living room here and they didn't like&nbsp;
that. Some people thought it was cool, but most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:57.600
people were threatened by that. And frankly, that&nbsp;
assembly fell apart quick because they were just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:03.760
thinking of themselves and they wanted to hold.&nbsp;
And I said, well, if a right is just for you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.400
it's a privilege and you're trying to hold on&nbsp;
to a privilege. But a right only exists when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:13.840
it's for everybody. Okay? everybody including the&nbsp;
ones they're calling you know illegal immigrants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:19.280
and all that we're all human beings we all have&nbsp;
the right you know a country based on immigration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:24.880
the country that grew up because you know the&nbsp;
statue of liberty there saying you're welcome&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:30.000
because we want the model of the republic to be&nbsp;
shared with everyone all over the world you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:38.400
um so that idea of individual versus collective&nbsp;
in the American constitution the idea was that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:44.320
only get individual liberties is secured when the&nbsp;
whole republic is intact. Like John Adams said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:50.240
unless we have a virtuous citizenry, you can't&nbsp;
have a republic. A virtuous people are always&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.920
thinking of their neighbor. They're not just&nbsp;
thinking of themselves. They want to take care of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:59.440
the neighbor. And I was raised that way in my my&nbsp;
family in Winnipeg because we were descended from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:05.920
this kind of extended Scottish clan. And in the&nbsp;
Scottish clan system, like with the indigenous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:12.160
um, everybody takes care of everybody else. You&nbsp;
don't I was raised to think and to and to practice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:17.760
um you don't worry about yourself. You worry about&nbsp;
each other and then you hold each other up. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:25.760
individual is sacri but only as part of the nation&nbsp;
right and um and so that's how they come together.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:33.040
The personal but people of raised in a very&nbsp;
individualistic culture um you know me me first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:38.400
and they equate that with liberty. it doesn't&nbsp;
work. Um because you're always fighting somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.720
else and guess who profits from that. You know,&nbsp;
when everyone's fighting everybody else, you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:49.120
a few elites coming in and they say, "Well, then&nbsp;
trust me." Right? Um and and it was interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:55.520
Another really good guy to read is his name is&nbsp;
Alexis Dtoqueville and he was a French nobleman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:00.960
uh aristocrat who came to America in the 1830s.&nbsp;
He wrote a book called Democracy in America.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:06.480
And as an outsider, it's brilliant because he sees&nbsp;
things that Americans don't. And he said, "America&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:12.720
will be prone to dictatorship because everyone and&nbsp;
every farmer," he went around the country and look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:16.400
because most people are living on the land and&nbsp;
they had their own farm and everything, very few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:21.760
of them were city dwellers. And he said, "Everyone&nbsp;
is so concerned about their individual liberty,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.640
which is unique. You don't see that in in Europe,&nbsp;
the idea of individual rights, but everyone is so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.920
concerned about their own life that the the job of&nbsp;
politics and governance will be then handed over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:41.360
to a few people and that will lead to tyranny. So&nbsp;
America has that that black and white kind of two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.080
aspects, two-headed aspects to them. You know,&nbsp;
everyone's talking about liberty, but in fact,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:52.320
look at, you know, the electoral college system.&nbsp;
The Supreme Court are all political appointees.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:56.480
um you know a few people in charge get the&nbsp;
right to say well we don't agree with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.120
election results us electors should put this&nbsp;
guy in instead of the one who got most votes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:06.880
right I mean that's that was all designed to keep&nbsp;
power in the hands of a few while talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:12.080
liberty for all so we've got to get from kind of&nbsp;
that's why the thing in America is so exciting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:17.200
this new development because we're getting back&nbsp;
to the original notion that the I is part of we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:24.240
and they're not separate at all and um so anyway&nbsp;
That's a new idea for some people, but it's really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:29.680
at the heart of what liberty really is about&nbsp;
if it's meant for everybody. Right. Right. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:34.880
sort of piggybacking off of the Declaration&nbsp;
of Independence here in America, what does it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:42.000
usually take to overturn something like that to&nbsp;
where it can be instituted on a national level or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:50.720
a local level as the new law, the new um the new&nbsp;
declaration? Uh how does that work? Like do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:55.200
do you know like a percentage of the population&nbsp;
that has to get on board with that or what it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:00.960
takes to overturn something like that? Well, it's&nbsp;
funny because states have different precedents for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:06.160
that and like in America it's you know there state&nbsp;
governments are almost autonomous. I mean like you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.560
look at a state like Vermont and its laws and then&nbsp;
compare it to South Carolina and it's like whoa&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:17.040
different countries right? Um but they they have&nbsp;
a tradition. I know I'll give you an example in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:23.040
Pennsylvania um and I I worked with a group there&nbsp;
who enacted this. It was beautiful to watch. In&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:30.000
Pennsylvania it says uh people have the right to&nbsp;
uh devolve power back to their community. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.280
called having a home rule charter. And you don't&nbsp;
need a percentage of the people. You just need u&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:41.840
Americans in a community to write up this charter.&nbsp;
And you can pass your own laws which are more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:49.360
valid than the state law. And the example in in in&nbsp;
case the case in point was um about 10 years ago&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:59.200
now in Pennsylvania in um in a county in central&nbsp;
Pennsylvania um Adams County I believe they u&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:06.240
the Pennsylvania General Energy was going to take&nbsp;
frack water. Now you know fracking it's u polluted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:12.640
water right and they were going to dump it on&nbsp;
the land and about 700 people live there and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:17.760
woman and her daughter uh they're amazing people&nbsp;
they got together and they started going around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:22.800
door to door and saying everybody Republican and&nbsp;
Democrat and people who never voted they said look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:29.520
we got to unite here and stop this so they they&nbsp;
headed assembly they passed the home rule charter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:36.240
and their first law was they abolished all dumping&nbsp;
of wastewater land uh fracking on their land. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:42.400
had a long legal battle for it and um eventually&nbsp;
they won. It took them a long time, but they just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:48.320
stuck to their guns and they just cited the P&nbsp;
Pennsylvania State Constitution. So this is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:53.920
beauty of America. It's already there. Like in&nbsp;
in Canada and England, well Canada especially,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:58.960
we've never had self-governance. We've never had&nbsp;
it. So we do have to challenge the system head on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:03.040
In America, you just have to take it back. You&nbsp;
just have to reclaim it. What's already there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.320
it's already there in the hearts and minds of&nbsp;
people. And it's also there in your own laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:14.320
But a lot of those laws are being nullified now&nbsp;
with this corporate system we've got. Like I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:19.200
told you the examples of these guys in Texas&nbsp;
who set up a common law group and they all got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:24.800
targeted and some of them are doing like a hundred&nbsp;
years in jail, right, for not appearing in court.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:32.800
It's just um my friend in in Chicago, he went&nbsp;
into the Catholic church and handed the priest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.360
a copy of my book and said, "Are you aware of&nbsp;
this policy of criminal where Catholic priests&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:42.400
have to and any Catholic has to cover up child&nbsp;
abuse?" The priest calls the police. The police&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:49.440
come and arrest my friend for talking to a priest&nbsp;
and they hand him a ticket and said, "You're up to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.640
appear in court." He walks into a room. It's not a&nbsp;
court. with a camera staring at him and the voice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.040
out of the camera says, "How do you plead?" And&nbsp;
he said, "For what? You're not a court. You're a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.120
camera." He said, "You have to plead or you'll go&nbsp;
to jail." Said, "This is not due process. It's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:09.600
a court." And he pled not guilty and they put him&nbsp;
in jail anyway. Like, does that sound like the law&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.320
to you? Does that sound like due process? That's&nbsp;
what goes on all the time. And especially with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:21.280
the fervor now over immigration and the ICE has a&nbsp;
bigger budget than any other federal agency now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:26.400
It's huge. And it's all about stripping people&nbsp;
of their inherent liberties and locking them away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:32.560
for the private prison industry, right? And the&nbsp;
for-profit prisons, if you look at a map of them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:37.680
like a big company like Geo, which is one of the&nbsp;
biggest for-profit prisons all over the South,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:43.680
all over Texas and the southern states, and&nbsp;
they make money by getting judges on their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:49.280
payroll to criminalize misdemeanors like failure&nbsp;
to repair in court. 20 years bang because you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:56.560
making lots of money for GEO that way and uh&nbsp;
the attorney general in Washington Pondi is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:02.480
a former lobbyist for the private prisons till&nbsp;
2019 and she's the attorney general helping them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:08.960
by saying okay hit people hard with sentences&nbsp;
so that we can profit and that's so in a way in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:13.280
theory it's all there in America what we need&nbsp;
but at the same time there's this other entity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:19.280
that's come in which has almost turned everything&nbsp;
the clock right back. So in a practical sense,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:24.480
Americans do have to have another revolution&nbsp;
literally. And the more people you have in it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:31.360
the less violent it is, right? You get go to the&nbsp;
police, you say stop, you know, stop serving this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:36.560
this corporate power and get back to what you&nbsp;
know the republic supposed to be. But that can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.960
only happen if you've got something to present to&nbsp;
them as an alternative. And that's why like the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:47.840
um one of the guys John Bradley who's uh chairing&nbsp;
one of these con they call them constitutional&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:53.840
conventions they set up a constitutional assembly&nbsp;
that reestablishes the republic in their community&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:58.640
and they say this is the republic now because you&nbsp;
can't find in Washington you can't find in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:07.520
courts um and you know they in the FBI and RCMP&nbsp;
training manual says now and I've seen a copy of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:14.160
this anyone who uses the word sovereignty is a&nbsp;
potential domestic terrorist. What? Well, that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:19.360
would include Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, all&nbsp;
the founding fathers are now domestic terrorists.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.520
So, they've hyped up the police to think, oh, you&nbsp;
talk sovereignty, you talk the Bill of Rights,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:29.440
and you're a terrorist. It's like it's this&nbsp;
counterrevolution that's happened and we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:34.000
to get back to who we are. And that's kind&nbsp;
of the reality of what we're in right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.760
right? Absolutely. Yes. And so in working with&nbsp;
people to establish sovereignty in all these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:44.720
different levels and especially for example these&nbsp;
groups that that you're currently working with,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:48.800
um I'd like for you to talk a little bit&nbsp;
maybe about some obstacles, some roadblocks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:54.720
some things to expect along the way and sort of&nbsp;
how you help groups and how you've done yourself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:54.720 --> 00:46:00.080
how you've navigated those different things. cuz&nbsp;
obviously this all sounds so great and we need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:04.880
empower people to to go through that and to be&nbsp;
able to get through it whenever there's those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:10.160
different things that might try to deter them.&nbsp;
It's not easy. It's you got to be honest with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:15.120
people right up front. Say we're not promising you&nbsp;
anything. There's no quick fix for this because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.760
it's taken years and years for this thing to come&nbsp;
into place, this corporate dictatorship we're in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.640
Right? And so it's a lifelong commitment and it's&nbsp;
something you have to teach your children because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:29.600
they're going to be involved in this. It's not&nbsp;
going to happen overnight, but there's ways that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:36.480
we've learned that you can act now to increase&nbsp;
the odds on more in our favor. Um, first of all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:41.120
you don't go public right away and you don't&nbsp;
invite all these people into an assembly because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.960
it falls apart quickly because there's no common&nbsp;
ground. there's different levels of understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:52.480
and commitment and it it becomes crazy that people&nbsp;
are it's like trying to hurt cats. You're just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.600
there's no common ground. So what you do is you&nbsp;
find a few people who are aware who've known each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:03.200
other because you can't do this work without trust&nbsp;
and knowing each other and you form a little cell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:09.520
group of three or four people and you start doing&nbsp;
things in small ways um and probing and finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:17.120
out local sympathetic police and and doing the&nbsp;
education process and eventually you get you each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.920
of let's say you have a cell of three people. Each&nbsp;
one of those three goes out and recruits three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:26.640
other people and you you go through a training&nbsp;
education process and then after a while there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:31.920
12 of you and so you can then sign a charter and&nbsp;
form a local republic assembly. That way you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:38.240
each other and if the boot comes down you split&nbsp;
off into the cell groups again, right? And it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.960
more secure. It's like what you do in a in a&nbsp;
police state. you have and when you read tales&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:48.160
from like resistance movements like the French&nbsp;
resistance and I've talked to people who were in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:52.800
it during World War II when I was younger and they&nbsp;
all operated that way. They had to have the cell&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:58.240
groups because they couldn't be infiltrated as&nbsp;
easily. You know, if you have a big organization,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:03.440
it'll get taken out and I've been through that a&nbsp;
lot. I know like all the signs. So, start small&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:10.080
but realize that in your in your smallness is&nbsp;
your strength and you can keep control over it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:16.480
right? It isn't some organization run by experts,&nbsp;
you know, and you see that a lot on the internet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:21.600
like I'm the expert. Follow this blueprint&nbsp;
and you've you'll be free. But they're just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:26.160
talking to individuals. They don't have a sense of&nbsp;
okay, but how do we does that work for the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:32.000
community? Right? So that's kind of like basic&nbsp;
common sense, but the thing that's lacking is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.800
the the determination, the will to carry on all&nbsp;
the time. And it's exciting when your when your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:44.320
life finds that purpose. You know, the kind&nbsp;
of the personal things we deal with in a day,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:51.520
they suddenly lose their importance. Um I my dad&nbsp;
had a a story from the Korean War where he said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.280
um there was this medic in their unit and they&nbsp;
were under fire and he would always be running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:59.120
around tending people and people were saying, you&nbsp;
know, look at this guy. He's right out there on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:04.240
the front lines. He has no fear. And he got hit&nbsp;
by shrapnel. Boom, boom, boom. and he's running&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.560
around bleeding from the shrapnel and somebody&nbsp;
says, "Do you need help?" He says,"I don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:14.080
time for shrapnel. I'm too busy here." Right? And&nbsp;
I always remember that quote like, "I don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:17.840
time for this." Like, "Okay, so I'm hit with&nbsp;
shrapnel. Doesn't matter. These guys are dying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:26.720
over here." Okay? And that's what the difference&nbsp;
between commitment and u just uh being observer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:32.480
right? Because when you learn under fire is the&nbsp;
only way to learn that what happens to you. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:37.280
it matters. But it's not as important as if you're&nbsp;
just sitting there in a room by yourself where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:43.280
you become so totally self-obsessed and and&nbsp;
the culture feeds into that, right? You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:48.000
um all the time they try to get you just kept&nbsp;
in your little mental bubble and not connect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.840
with other people. So once you get out there&nbsp;
and start doing things and I say to people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:56.640
it doesn't even matter what you do, just do&nbsp;
something. Like Napoleon said when he was asked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.560
"How do you plan a battle?" He said, "I never&nbsp;
plan a battle. I start something and I see what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:06.960
happens." Because a battle of any kind is like&nbsp;
life. It shifts all the time. It's constantly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:11.440
in motion and shifts and all your blueprints go&nbsp;
out the window. You've got to always be observant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:17.040
on the ground what's going on and adapt and think&nbsp;
in new strategies and tactics thinking creatively&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:20.720
like that, right? So, it's a very exciting&nbsp;
process because you have a sense after a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:27.440
while of waking up for the first time, right? Um&nbsp;
people under fire say, "I never felt more alive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:32.320
than when when we're getting shot at." Because&nbsp;
life achieves like finally see the meaning of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:37.360
it. Every moment of life is so precious. You've&nbsp;
got to use every moment and as opposed to kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:45.520
of this nineto-five dead existence were raised to&nbsp;
think that is life and it isn't. Right. So yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:51.040
that story really touches my heart. It's a&nbsp;
really relatable way of sort of explaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:57.120
how myself and I think everybody that you know&nbsp;
every whistleblower, every survivor going forward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.600
that's like a big question I'm sure you get and&nbsp;
something that's come up on the show sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:08.240
is you know pursuing action despite the obstacles&nbsp;
that come in your path. And I think that really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:14.080
does come from elevating your your purpose to&nbsp;
something bigger than you. You know, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:18.320
we have a part in it and we have to take care&nbsp;
of ourselves through it to make sure that we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:23.680
sustain the endurance and the marathon. Like you&nbsp;
said, change just doesn't happen right overnight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:29.520
because we get passionate about something. But I&nbsp;
think it helps also really sort of deflect those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:34.160
bullets that that come towards us too because&nbsp;
it's like how we see in your story. You've been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:38.480
defamed. You've had everything taken from you.&nbsp;
You've had smear campaigns. I mean, the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:44.160
gambit has been thrown at you. you know, quarter&nbsp;
million dollar smear campaigns against one man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.680
you know, and so I'm sure you get asked all the&nbsp;
time, you know, how did you keep going or why did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:47.680 --> 00:51:54.240
you keep going? And I think when we understand&nbsp;
the the consequence of not going forward,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:58.560
the cost of human life in the case of what&nbsp;
we're talking about, you know, genocide,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:02.640
when you think about that, that that's still&nbsp;
happening. This isn't just the past that you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:07.360
talking about, even though you referenced the&nbsp;
past because that was where your journey started,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:14.080
but this is still going on today. And so the cost&nbsp;
of not moving forward is this continuing and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:19.120
still just being covered up. And so I feel like&nbsp;
when we know something and when we know change&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:25.120
needs to take place, there's an honor in carrying&nbsp;
that because we get to carry that for the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:29.920
that didn't make it out of those situations and&nbsp;
that are still in it that wish that they could be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:34.560
in our shoes. You know, I try to think about these&nbsp;
kids in these schools that you advocate for and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:38.560
you know, all the different types of survivors&nbsp;
that you advocate for of all different, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:44.640
abuse types, but how any of those children would&nbsp;
just give anything to be able to have a voice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:49.280
you know, especially as they grow into an adult&nbsp;
if they survive these systems, you know? So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:54.560
it really is like it becomes an honor to get to&nbsp;
fight and the bullets don't you you almost sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:59.680
of repel them naturally because it's like go ahead&nbsp;
and attack me. Like, it's not about me. I'm doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:03.760
this for other people. So, go ahead and attack&nbsp;
me all you want, but I need to go, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.440
into this burning building and get these people&nbsp;
out. You know, you can shoot at me all you want,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:12.160
but there's people being hurt right now that I&nbsp;
need to attend to. Well, that thing about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:17.280
burning building is really important. I'm glad you&nbsp;
raised it because there's a a if you see a child&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.360
in a burning building, you don't worry about&nbsp;
the flames. There's this natural thing and you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:25.920
don't have to be the child's mother either. Anyone&nbsp;
will boom, go in there and what is that? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:33.760
it's it's so inherent in us, right? And um that's&nbsp;
why I say to people um for your own, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:38.960
kind of well-being, you can never do anything by&nbsp;
yourself because they love that. Then they go,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:43.600
"Oh, good. We're going to make an example of this&nbsp;
person." Bang. Throw them away for 20 years. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:47.200
people tell the horror stories, I always say,&nbsp;
"Yeah, but the person in a way brought it on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:51.920
themselves because they tried to do it on their&nbsp;
own." You never just declare, "I'm not paying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:56.160
taxes to Uncle Sam anymore." No, you form an&nbsp;
assembly and pass a law and say, "We're keeping&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:02.320
federal tax on our community. and 50 people do&nbsp;
that. It's harder to target target 50 than one.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:08.960
So, we got to start thinking together, you know,&nbsp;
not just how to do it, but doing it together at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:14.240
all times. You never like another tip, you never&nbsp;
go in if you want to challenge somebody or you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:18.640
go into a court or whatever, you never go by&nbsp;
yourself. You always have two or three witnesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.760
and somebody with a camera so you have a record&nbsp;
of everything. And so just learning to operate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:29.120
that way is a new way of thinking for people but&nbsp;
it's it's essential otherwise you don't last long&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:36.000
and you get used and you know I mean I've seen too&nbsp;
many people who do that who don't learn the lesson&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:42.960
and that's what these books are all about passing&nbsp;
the on these truths right yes and so speaking of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:49.840
court obviously that is a big part of this is&nbsp;
trying to get some type of of law established&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:55.840
in our communities that becomes in official&nbsp;
law and overwrites whatever wasn't working. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:55.840 --> 00:55:00.320
how do we enforce these court orders? Like what's&nbsp;
important to know about going to court? At what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:06.160
point would would a group want to do that and&nbsp;
what do they need to prepare for that? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:11.840
we're talking about exactly that issue with&nbsp;
this group in Texas that's been so targeted. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:17.360
uh the first problem was they went into the&nbsp;
existing courts and what's set up now. They're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:22.640
not courts of law operating according to due&nbsp;
process. They're more like military courts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:29.280
administrative tribunals, where there's no due&nbsp;
process. You're not assumed to be innocent. Uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:33.920
you're assumed to be guilty and it's up to you.&nbsp;
Like like in a a heresy trial in the Middle Ages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:38.560
or what I went through. You have to go along and&nbsp;
agree with the system and help destroy yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:44.160
Otherwise, you get, you know, you're you're&nbsp;
somehow looking guilty for not doing that. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:49.760
you don't go into the existing what are called&nbsp;
courts at all. And if they try to come for you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:55.840
there's ways you can defend yourself. It always&nbsp;
involves other people. It declans going to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:01.920
police locally and saying, you know, that I don't&nbsp;
recognize that jurisdiction of that court over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:07.760
me. And in fact, there's things like habius&nbsp;
corpus and mandamus rits that you can you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:15.520
uh file in local court registry and it says&nbsp;
I'm transferring if you're being targeted. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:20.640
there's a case against you, you say, "Okay, but&nbsp;
I'm transferring the jurisdiction from this false&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:26.320
court that has no authority over me into our own&nbsp;
common law court, which we've established here,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:33.120
which does have jurisdiction because it's based on&nbsp;
universal common law." And uh and so we, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:37.120
we've helped people do that, but you need a&nbsp;
team around you to do that. And that's why I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:42.640
say don't ever try it on your own. Don't go into&nbsp;
their jurisdiction. contact us and we can help&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:47.760
bring that's what I do 90% of the time now with&nbsp;
people just bringing that support and knowledge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:53.440
to bear so that you don't walk in and put the&nbsp;
noose around your own neck which often happens&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:53.440 --> 00:57:00.480
um enforcement the power of enforcement in common&nbsp;
courts is tremendous because everyone is empowered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:06.720
to enforce the verdict right in a common and&nbsp;
that's why Ringer after we convicted him he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:10.960
hid out in the Vatican till the day he died&nbsp;
because he knew anyone can enforce that vertic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:19.440
against him to arrest the guy. Um you know so&nbsp;
any citizen is obligated to be deputized by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:28.400
a sheriff Kamla sheriff and in in effect made&nbsp;
into a posy. Uh now that's got western movies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:34.240
and that have made it seem like a posi is like a&nbsp;
lynch mob. It isn't. It comes from a Latin term&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:41.440
from the English Shy communities in the Middle&nbsp;
Ages. And every able-bodied man was expected to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:47.920
help defend the community. So somebody was found&nbsp;
guilty of of murder or for example, everyone the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:52.720
posi were deputized local sheriffs who would then&nbsp;
go and arrest the person to make sure they didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:58.000
harm anyone. Everyone has a obligation to do&nbsp;
that. So you know this verdict, I say to people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:03.040
we're holding this gun in our hand. We don't&nbsp;
even realize the power of what we've done. Every&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:09.200
Catholic priest in the world is part of a criminal&nbsp;
conspiracy to protect child rapists. That means&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:14.320
you have the right to go and not just arrest&nbsp;
them as individuals but seize, you know, their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:19.920
buildings and assets, you know, and they have and&nbsp;
they know that. You see, they're not stupid. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:25.360
know people have that power now, but they rely&nbsp;
on people's fear and ignorance, you know, to to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:31.680
not to prevent that enforcement of that. But we&nbsp;
could reclaim the whole world tomorrow if people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:36.960
knew that because we own the world inherently.&nbsp;
All of us, you know, according to natural law,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:44.320
right? Especially when the people in power&nbsp;
so-called power are convicted criminals. Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.120
Exactly. And that's a hard realization, but you&nbsp;
know, it it really is empowering to learn how our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:53.520
world works and then to realize that, hey, we've&nbsp;
been letting all these people just rule over us.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:57.680
We've just been sitting back watching. It's time&nbsp;
for us. like we can actually be the leaders of our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:03.120
world and take matters into our own hands. And&nbsp;
so kind of speaking of that, so you established&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:07.840
the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church&nbsp;
and State. You mentioned a couple of these other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:14.880
groups have established a group that has a name.&nbsp;
Um what would you recommend if people do want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:19.760
have a group? Is it important to have sort of an&nbsp;
established organizational name? Do they need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:26.720
incorporate? Um what's kind of a step to do um&nbsp;
that's the most effective in your opinion? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:32.160
not incorporate because that's the system. You&nbsp;
know that corpus means corpse dead. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:38.000
you're you becoming a dead thing. Uh we don't&nbsp;
do any of that. We um it's good to have a name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.440
and identity. You know that you know we belong&nbsp;
to this now, right? We don't belong to the old&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:50.320
system. That's why citizenship cards, a flag, um&nbsp;
you know, a name for ourselves is very important.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:58.960
So um that yeah that's absolutely part of this&nbsp;
whole process right thing to understand as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:06.880
is that um allegiances are something drilled into&nbsp;
somebody's head from birth and it's very hard to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:11.200
get people to switch an allegiance. So we don't&nbsp;
language is very important. We don't use the word&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:18.400
allegiance. Um it's slave master slave language&nbsp;
like please and thank you. these terms we're all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:25.360
tra you know it's like subordinate um to plea in&nbsp;
court to make a plea it's like you're pleading&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:29.680
to the slave master right like these are terms&nbsp;
all designed to program you to like the word&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:37.440
arrogant taught that's bad to be arrogant um it&nbsp;
the Italian word it comes from arrogati means to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:44.560
claim for yourself okay so why is that a bad thing&nbsp;
it isn't but your brain wants to think when you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:50.640
outget you're being bad Right? And and so you see&nbsp;
the way we're all drilled to be functional slaves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:55.440
even though don't they don't call it that,&nbsp;
right? So when you start breaking out of that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:00.160
um you can't it's too much of a mental shock&nbsp;
to tell people we're ending this and beginning&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.640
this. You say, "No, we're reclaiming we're&nbsp;
reclaiming something that was always ours,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:10.480
but we've been kept in the dark. We're being kept&nbsp;
asleep about all this stuff. Now awaken to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:16.000
and just reclaim it." Because once you reclaim&nbsp;
it, enough people do that, their whole system goes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.080
into the toilet because it's parasitic. It's&nbsp;
a form of energy vampireism. It feeds off our&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.720
attention. That's why I say to people, turn off&nbsp;
the internet, folks. Those people don't matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:34.400
You know, look in the mirror, look at each other.&nbsp;
That's that's how you get your power back. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:39.360
you for sharing that. That's really interesting.&nbsp;
I actually didn't know that even though I've I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:45.120
thought about how strange it is that confidence&nbsp;
is looked at you know they don't it's it's rarely&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:51.920
heard that that that word arrogant and confidence&nbsp;
sort of goes hand in hand but it's always denoted&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:57.520
as this negative thing you know arrogance&nbsp;
arrogance ego arrogance when I think when&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:04.320
people don't have that then like you said they're&nbsp;
very submissive and they give their power away to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:10.000
ar to actual arrogance people in the definition&nbsp;
that society thinks that it is. Somebody is going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:15.040
to have power over us if it's not us. You&nbsp;
know, if we don't take our own power back,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:19.840
then we're going to give it to somebody else to&nbsp;
rule us, you know, for us. And so, I think that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:24.320
that's a really important distinction and it's&nbsp;
really actually interesting how how, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.160
we've sort of forgotten the roots of some of these&nbsp;
words, even genocide, like how we talked about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:34.000
the first time that that we chatted. Well, it's&nbsp;
funny. I actually start the book in the intro here&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.880
uh with best examples are from her own family. And&nbsp;
so when my daughter Elellanar was really little,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:46.640
she had two favorite expressions. She always&nbsp;
said, "You're not the boss of me." To everybody.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:50.480
She would say that to everybody and her teachers&nbsp;
in school. You're not the boss of me. Which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:56.880
true. Nobody's our boss. She also said, "But why?&nbsp;
Why, Daddy? Why? Why?" She was always asking why.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:02.560
She had to know for herself because she knew&nbsp;
that Elellanar was governing herself. She said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:09.840
"I govern myself." Right now, you know, that's&nbsp;
so common sense and it's every child knows that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.520
and that's why everything's designed to&nbsp;
batter that out of them, that awareness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:18.560
make them afraid of themselves, right?&nbsp;
That way. But I always think that yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.400
the examples are so close to home. We just&nbsp;
have to see it in our own family, our own life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:28.320
right? Yeah. We forget to that we have the power&nbsp;
to ask why. and that we deserve an answer if&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.120
there's going to be a law or somebody trying to&nbsp;
govern over us or tell us what to do instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:38.000
just accepting it. You know, we'll complain about&nbsp;
stuff without addressing that and saying, "Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:43.520
why?" You know, can we learn the reasons and make&nbsp;
sure that this is a good outcome at the end first&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:51.440
before this is just thrown on us as being the law&nbsp;
or a rule or something that we have to abide by.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:51.440 --> 01:04:00.960
Yeah. And and kind of a PS on that story, Ellaner&nbsp;
is now studying law. No way. America. Proud dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:07.280
She Oh, I'm very proud of her. She's like me.&nbsp;
She's like me. It's like human rights law, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:15.120
women in the law and and that kind of thing. So,&nbsp;
she's a humanitarian like you. Well, she's Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:18.960
it carries on. I mean, and that's a metaphor&nbsp;
for all of us like we are obligated to the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:25.840
generation to pass this on, right? So absolutely&nbsp;
on their shoulders. Yeah. And so in this quest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:31.840
going back to sort of the talking about getting&nbsp;
people together, taking action in your experience,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:36.640
what have been some of the the big successes that&nbsp;
you can share? And then also on the other end,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:40.640
what are some of the kind of pitfalls or failures&nbsp;
that that you've gone through that that you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:46.400
learned from and that we can learn from with you?&nbsp;
Well, there have been so many victories, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:52.080
and people expect huge immediate results from&nbsp;
victory. I think it's part of the movie culture,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:58.560
you know, when you see these things in television&nbsp;
or movies. But, um, the victories are because it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.480
all human. It's very, very personal and very&nbsp;
up close. And, you know, when I saw people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:07.760
who couldn't even like the example of William&nbsp;
Kums being in the church with us that day when&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:13.040
the sound of a church bell would terrify him, make&nbsp;
him vomit and there he is. He's like a new person.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:17.200
just the power of that. And when everyone saw him&nbsp;
like that, we were in tears. We were embracing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.960
each other when we walked out of the church&nbsp;
because we knew we had turned the tide there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:27.120
And sure enough, that same month, the government&nbsp;
started talking about apologies and missing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:32.240
children directly because we were occupying those&nbsp;
churches. And the look in the eyes of those people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.720
and the sense we had among each other. These are&nbsp;
mostly poor Aboriginal people who've been under&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:43.280
the boot their whole life, okay, and traumatized&nbsp;
and tortured from a young age. The hope in their&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:51.600
eyes suddenly we caused that. Okay, we caused&nbsp;
that. That was a victory that went boom. It it it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.760
just had it's still having a ripple effect, right?&nbsp;
And you know when you tell people that they think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:03.440
well how could David have brought down Goliath&nbsp;
like that like is that it doesn't sound possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:08.080
but you got to experience once you experience it&nbsp;
you know it's very possible it's more possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:14.000
than people realize right that we've had a lot&nbsp;
of things like that and um I mean another victory&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:20.640
you there were 20,000 of us marching through the&nbsp;
streets of London right when the pro when Pope&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:27.760
Benedict came to London it was called the protest&nbsp;
the pope march The organizers expected 500 people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:34.080
20,000 show up and we had the downtown part&nbsp;
of London so shut down. Normally the London&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:39.840
cops put in these barriers and guide people on&nbsp;
we people were just pushing the barriers back.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:44.560
weren't afraid and the cops were kind of standing&nbsp;
impotently over at the side not knowing what to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:50.320
do but there was 20,000 and we're passing Canada&nbsp;
house which is the Canadian embassy right into&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:55.360
Fogger Square and I thought oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is too&nbsp;
good an opportunity to pass up so I pull out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:59.760
bullhorn and I start saying to people I start&nbsp;
talking about the Canadian genocide and these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:04.400
British people are really funny they're going&nbsp;
oh no not Canada that couldn't have happened in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:08.880
Canada oh my god we didn't know anything about&nbsp;
this and they start applauding and cheering&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:15.360
And one funny thing that happened, I I hear&nbsp;
a voice behind me. Oh, very well done. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:20.720
I look around and there's Gandalf, you know, the&nbsp;
actor who plays Gandalf uh in Lord of the Rings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:25.680
uh Ian Mckllen. Okay, he's standing there. He's&nbsp;
kind of he's like 6'4. He's kind of standing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:32.240
above me. He said, "Well done. Well done." And&nbsp;
um I said, "Well, talk about this." And he said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:38.560
"I certainly will." And then gave me a crushing&nbsp;
handshake and uh carried on with his group. Right.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:45.760
But I thought like all of those things, it's just&nbsp;
such beautiful memories and um you know, you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:50.160
got them on the run at that point when people are&nbsp;
that united and that happy. And I always say to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:57.520
people, I've gotten my my greatest joys in life&nbsp;
when my daughters were born and I helped deliver&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:04.800
them, but also um at those moments when people are&nbsp;
united and they realize they can change the world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:10.000
right? and and those are the the the heartfelt&nbsp;
victories that they never steal from you. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:17.280
always carry on those memories. Um the things&nbsp;
that um the other side of the coin you said the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:23.920
uh mistakes or was it how did you put it? Yeah,&nbsp;
I guess the kind of the pitfalls, the failures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:31.600
the when you in a way when you uh you build up&nbsp;
in your enthusiasm, you can say to people, okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.320
we're going to you can promise them things that&nbsp;
you may not be able to deliver and that's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:42.400
a good thing because when people get up their&nbsp;
hopes and then it they crash, it's worse than&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:48.880
if you never tried it. Yeah. And and it's set up&nbsp;
that way. That's why they like the government and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:55.920
churches and others lead you down blind alleys,&nbsp;
right? And say, "Okay, well, just come to court&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:00.400
and we'll give you compensation." And then they&nbsp;
don't. That that whole thing about the residential&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:05.120
school survivors, they led them on with the&nbsp;
belief that they could get justice through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:10.560
courts. And in fact, they get a gag order and very&nbsp;
little money and people, you know, I knew people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:16.320
would kill themselves in despair after that. So,&nbsp;
it's designed to do that, the opposite of what I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:21.680
just talked about, the victory. It's designed to&nbsp;
discourage, make people despairing, and then lock&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:26.880
back up in their little poles again, right, where&nbsp;
they won't do anything. So, you got to be careful&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:35.120
the way, never promise too much. Don't take people&nbsp;
down blind alleys. Um, and yet be be bold in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:42.560
those moments that come along. And again quoting&nbsp;
Napoleon in every battle there is one moment of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:49.120
decisive moment. The key the great art is to seize&nbsp;
that moment. Okay? So when you're you're part of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.640
movement you'll see opportunities come along and&nbsp;
if you strike at that moment strategically at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:01.200
right place like we did, you win, you know, and&nbsp;
doesn't matter how big the bad guy is, you'll win.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:05.920
And and so that's misjudging the moment that can&nbsp;
you you're going to learn to think strategically&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:12.720
all the time, right? Yeah. 100%. And I'd love&nbsp;
to hear a little bit about sort of you have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:18.640
very successful both with educating yourself on&nbsp;
this and then implementing it into actual action.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:24.000
And you've obviously with your own work, you've&nbsp;
been helping seize the land and recover the church&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:31.840
buildings, you know, from this sort of evil uh&nbsp;
generational, I should say, multi-generational&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.160
um system that has been inhabiting it. I'd&nbsp;
love to hear a little bit about how you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:41.840
been sort of deestablishing this genocide that&nbsp;
is happening in the church and crowns, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:46.960
cuz I think it's really neat just to see kind of&nbsp;
your work in action and so that way we can sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:52.080
wrap our minds around things that we can do with&nbsp;
whatever the causes that we're fighting for. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:58.560
you know, where the it's worked, it's always among&nbsp;
uh groups of people who already know each other&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:06.160
and are working together and it tends to happen in&nbsp;
small towns. So, for example, like in a big city,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:10.080
there's a big cathedral with people going in.&nbsp;
It's kind of hard to imagine, well, how do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:15.440
occupy that? And like unless you've got people&nbsp;
who've already tried it, right? Where it's worked,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:19.680
and I've been there at these moments, native&nbsp;
people just say, "To hell with us. We're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:27.280
in." And they go in and tell the priest to get&nbsp;
out. And in Canada, the advantage is it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:32.880
politically very wise to start locking up a lot&nbsp;
of native people for just asserting their their&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:37.760
land right. And they have the right to seize those&nbsp;
churches, the law of reparation. The church has&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.960
done so much damage to their people that they&nbsp;
have every right to take that as reparations&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:47.840
because they never got any financial compensation&nbsp;
of any kind. And they've been the churches built&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:52.640
on their land without asking permission. So that's&nbsp;
Chief Kapalano when we occupied the churches in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:59.360
Vancouver. He had filed a a thing in Supreme Court&nbsp;
of British Columbia saying they're I'm ordering&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:04.320
them off our land at that point. And he made me&nbsp;
his legal agent so I can enforce that. That's why&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:09.440
the police never stopped our church occupations.&nbsp;
I showed them the court order and I said, "We have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:14.240
every right to do this. They're the criminals.&nbsp;
They have a policy to protect child rapists. Help&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.880
us arrest them." And at that point, the police&nbsp;
always leave. You know, they don't intervene. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.280
don't help. but they don't hang around. So, you've&nbsp;
got a great lever in those situations. And I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:29.360
seen like there was one uh up north in northern&nbsp;
BC where a group of grandmothers went in and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:34.720
during a Catholic mass and they just went into the&nbsp;
pulpit and they ordered everybody out. They said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:39.840
"This is our land. You use this church to kill&nbsp;
our people now. Get out." Just told them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:44.080
get out and they took it over. The Mounties were&nbsp;
outside with a little cruiser and the light going,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:48.720
but they never did anything. Right. It's funny.&nbsp;
The Mounties would come to me as the only white&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:53.680
guy and ask me and I said, "I'm not in charge. Go&nbsp;
talk to the grandmothers." And they didn't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:57.920
do that, right? I said, "You want to arrest some&nbsp;
grandmothers? Like, we'll film this. You guys will&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:03.920
be on the evening news. Come on, go ahead." So,&nbsp;
you gota you have we have so much power. It's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.960
the frustrating thing is people aren't trained&nbsp;
to how to exercise it and and we tend to want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:14.800
follow an example and you know and that's why you&nbsp;
do have to lead by example but we just got to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.200
those stories and those and film those incidents&nbsp;
and get them out. We did have that posted but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:26.400
again taken out swabbed out very quickly like the&nbsp;
time in Liverpool England where this was about 15&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:32.400
years ago now there was a judge imposing illegal&nbsp;
county taxes. So the local common law group, some&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:38.960
of these people are now involved in organizing&nbsp;
the republic um their Liverpool branch, but uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:45.200
the Republic of Albon in England, but they got&nbsp;
about 300 guys together, women, I say God, men and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:51.840
women. Um and they went into the court and they&nbsp;
physically took the judge out of the seat, disroed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:51.840 --> 01:14:00.880
him and put somebody else in and they nullified&nbsp;
the county tax and fired him. And the judge were&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:06.080
last seen kind of scurrying out of the courtroom.&nbsp;
And it's funny because in the American Revolution&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.880
before the first shots were fired at Concord in&nbsp;
Lexington. That's exactly what they did. Like the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:15.520
Green Mountain Boys in Vermont, they would go&nbsp;
into Crown Courts, burn up the mortgage deeds&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.560
because the crownbacked New York finance series&nbsp;
were just buying up everybody's land and evicting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:26.080
the farmers. They go in, they threw the court.&nbsp;
Uh, and there's a cartoon of a crown judge running&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:30.880
down to the ship to get on the boat to go back to&nbsp;
England because the Green Mountain Boys had taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:36.480
over the court and burned all the mortgage deeds.&nbsp;
That's the first shots that were fired, right? And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:42.720
um, they knew strike where the problem was. And&nbsp;
that's the same thing like 250 years later doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:47.440
the same thing. You know, you're that's why in&nbsp;
in Chile a few years ago, the Mapuchi Indians&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:53.200
burned like 25 Catholic churches to the ground&nbsp;
because they were seizing the local native land.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:57.600
They were trafficking the children out of the&nbsp;
churches. So, the Mapuche said, "Screw you. Your&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:04.400
churches are gone." And Burggalio, Pope Francis,&nbsp;
was besieged in the papal palace in San Diego. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.560
couldn't get out. There's a crowd of 2,000 angry&nbsp;
papuches outside besieging the pope in the palace.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:14.480
It's like, but again, how often do you hear these&nbsp;
stories? You only hear it from the people who did&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:14.480 --> 01:15:21.600
it, right? So that's why I I really cherish&nbsp;
your u broadcasts because we're getting these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.960
real stories out to people, you know. Yeah. And&nbsp;
and on my channel, there's been so many different&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:32.720
establishments that have been whistleblown to&nbsp;
be corrupt from universities to Freemason lodges&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:39.840
to churches to schools. Um, you know, there's no&nbsp;
shortage of establishments in our own community,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:45.120
courts included, police stations, police officers.&nbsp;
You know, there's so much corruption that's right&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:50.720
around us in our community. And and I love that&nbsp;
reminder that we can do things peacefully without&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:55.920
violence, making a point by getting people&nbsp;
together that approach things a certain way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:02.640
And just because maybe, you know, it doesn't seem&nbsp;
polite to like go right in and sort of protest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.960
against something that we overcome that and be&nbsp;
like, well, is it polite what they're doing to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.040
kids or is it polite what they're doing? Like,&nbsp;
we need to go in and make a difference and bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:15.920
awareness to this and to also take our power back&nbsp;
from worrying about, you know, the nuance of what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:21.680
will people think of me if I take a stand against&nbsp;
this in my own community. That's right. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:27.680
and uh you never worry about what's official&nbsp;
anyway because corruption exists because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:35.040
apathy. We help curb the corruption by doing&nbsp;
nothing about it. So don't point your not you but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:40.080
anyone who points corruption points at corruption&nbsp;
say well why aren't you doing something about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:45.040
right? It's not it's not just a matter of like&nbsp;
the system rests on corruption. The system of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:51.840
greed and self-interest requires corruption.&nbsp;
Right? So we morally replace that and bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:56.480
in people's power governing themselves. You won't&nbsp;
have corruption, you know, because you're telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:56.480 --> 01:17:02.480
people to go to the high ground and out of act&nbsp;
out of your virtue and not your self-interest,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:09.680
greed. And we don't have to adapt to this filth&nbsp;
anymore around us. And uh we teach that. I hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:15.840
that for example this interview we're doing be&nbsp;
great to show it to children in school. Show it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:20.080
to high school students. Say start thinking about&nbsp;
these things. It's in your hands. I'll be dead in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:27.920
however many number of years. It's up to you guys,&nbsp;
men and women. And so, speaking of time, more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:31.920
generations to come. You've been whistleblowing&nbsp;
for decades and and working at this and getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:37.840
other groups to help and and it's been a very slow&nbsp;
process, I'm sure, of educating and then getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:42.800
people off their, you know, off their butts to&nbsp;
go take action and especially in groups. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:47.680
talk about what's at stake. What is the time that&nbsp;
we have left? you know, do we still have decades&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:52.800
and generations or what have you seen in your time&nbsp;
and how time is accelerating and how we're keeping&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:59.040
up with it? You know, I think with the technology&nbsp;
at play and what's going on in the world and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:08.480
clearly a move to create these corporate spheres,&nbsp;
uh, run, you know, running the world, um, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:16.560
whole plan to, um, really turn the human race into&nbsp;
functional robots, cybernetic organisms through&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:23.200
the technology, it's happening exponentially&nbsp;
quicker all the time. And I don't know in 10 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:30.080
or 5 years it may be so locked in that there is no&nbsp;
way to fight it. And I think we people have to see&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:35.120
the urgency of this. It's something right on our&nbsp;
doorstep happening right now. Because it hasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:41.120
hit you doesn't mean it's not happening right and&nbsp;
you'll see it hit you when when the knock comes in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:45.040
your door and then it'll be too late. So I would&nbsp;
say to people this has to be the priority of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:53.280
life and if not what life will we have right so&nbsp;
that urgency I also see lacking in people you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:53.280 --> 01:19:00.240
um it's a matter of life and death now right yes&nbsp;
and I appreciate you sharing that too because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:05.600
think that's we always think we have more time&nbsp;
you know but we don't realize how every day that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:10.640
goes by every year they're able to advance what&nbsp;
they're doing exponentially because they have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:15.200
more resources and more power. They have more&nbsp;
sort of permission, less people standing up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:22.240
more technology, you know. So I my hope always is&nbsp;
that people feel that urgency along with us and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:27.440
again feel compelled to get up and do something&nbsp;
about it. Go ahead. They are they are because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:32.960
like we started talking about the new movements in&nbsp;
England and America. Talking to those people, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:38.000
say the same thing I see all the time. There's a&nbsp;
huge ground swell of opposition everywhere now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:44.720
And it's like when you study revolutions in the&nbsp;
past, every time like a month before the outbreak&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:44.720 --> 01:19:48.800
happens, people are all saying the same thing.&nbsp;
It's not going to happen in our lifetime. People&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:53.120
are too apathetic. There's not doing anything.&nbsp;
Next thing you know, bang, the Bastile has fallen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:58.320
right? And I mean, things always work that&nbsp;
way. It's it's it's like an iceberg. Most of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:04.320
it you don't see. It's under underground under the&nbsp;
water. But boom, one day, you know, it'll surface&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:08.800
and sooner than later. And so that's why this&nbsp;
knowledge is essential and why we need to organize&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:15.840
have the steam and the piston both operating now&nbsp;
to get our movement going. Right. Yes. Exactly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:20.160
And one more question that I had for you and then&nbsp;
if there's anything else that you want to cover,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:26.960
I'll give you some. This is good. Yeah. Um I think&nbsp;
I always love again learning lessons from you. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:31.120
of course there's the action that we talked about&nbsp;
about sitting idally, knowing something's wrong,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:35.520
and then actually getting up and and trying to&nbsp;
expose it or do something about it. But you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:41.360
gone an extra step to where you're trying to not&nbsp;
just expose it but stop it. Can you talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:47.120
that transition for you and sort of your mindset&nbsp;
in those two different things? Because exposing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:51.440
and stopping are very different. And I think&nbsp;
that's where we need to move as as a society&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:58.960
is stopping, right? And stopping means create&nbsp;
alternative. And we can talk about that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:58.960 --> 01:21:03.840
in the abstract, but it's only in your life&nbsp;
experience that you you learn these things. And I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.840
made that mistake early on. I thought it was just&nbsp;
a matter of educating people. You know, I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:13.840
the Quakers have the saying, speak truth to power&nbsp;
as if doing that is going to get the power to go,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:18.880
"Oh my god, we're wrong. You mean we're hurting&nbsp;
people?" It assumes a moral capacity on the rulers&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:23.760
that doesn't exist because a corporation has no&nbsp;
morality. It's just about its own survival. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:27.840
you advance high up in the hierarchy by being&nbsp;
like that, by being a functional psychopath.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:33.120
So you can't appeal to the morals. And we talk&nbsp;
about that in our handbooks. You don't rely on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:39.600
the system at all. Right? Um I had to learn that&nbsp;
the hard way. Uh and I only learned it because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:44.080
everything in my life was ripped apart and I had&nbsp;
to create something new. And I think the best&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:48.640
fighters are the people who are like that. Like&nbsp;
the native people who occupied those churches with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:54.640
me and a few others. They didn't have any life&nbsp;
left over. They could take the risk, right? And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:54.640 --> 01:22:00.480
realize that they had to do it. Um what did they&nbsp;
have to lose, right? And I think we'll eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.800
get to that point. enough of us are getting to&nbsp;
that point where our backs are to the wall and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:09.760
like Sunsu says in the art of war, never push an&nbsp;
enemy into a corner because then they really come&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:16.400
on fighting because I know they're going to die.&nbsp;
So, and I think we got to have our sense of our&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:20.800
own mortality in this. I think that's why I'm more&nbsp;
impassionate all the time because I can see the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:25.840
end of my life closer than the beginning, right?&nbsp;
And I realize, okay, every moment has to count in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:31.360
this and we're all going to die. The question&nbsp;
is on what terms and what are you going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:37.600
leave behind, right? Not this idea that we're not&nbsp;
going to, right? There's a we all have an expiry&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:42.960
date and what are you going to do between now and&nbsp;
then? It's going to be in our mind all the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:50.880
right? Absolutely. you know, and and sort of from&nbsp;
my own perspective this week, you brought up Pam&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:55.760
Bondi here in the United States and we're sort&nbsp;
of facing a crisis as a nation and you're seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:00.960
it before it's happening in a group of people&nbsp;
who are just saying screw politics like why are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:06.240
we participating in this, you know, but but we&nbsp;
are seeing more and more people that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:10.480
they're having faith in these saviors that are&nbsp;
that they're they think that they're electing into&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:15.600
office to create change and then they're being let&nbsp;
down and starting to question everything. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:20.240
if they lied about this, if they're not, for&nbsp;
example, going to release the Epstein list,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:24.560
what else were they lying about? Was the&nbsp;
assassination attempt a lie? Was this a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:31.760
lie? Were the other promises that they made a lie?&nbsp;
You know, so it is really neat to see sort of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:37.520
critical thought process starting to infuse itself&nbsp;
back into society. But it's just like you said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:43.840
and I think that you're just such a great example&nbsp;
of of words are great, but what action are you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:48.720
taking and what are you actively trying to do to&nbsp;
not just educate because people don't know always&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:53.440
what to do with education. You know, we've been&nbsp;
educating on things for a long time. There's no&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:58.880
lack of people that believe and know on some level&nbsp;
that corruption is happening. But taking action&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:04.320
to actually stop it is different than exposing it.&nbsp;
And that differentiation and what you've done with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:10.720
your path, I think, is heroic. Kevin, it makes an&nbsp;
impact. It inspires people and it's so wonderful&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:15.440
that people like you exist. You know, it gives me&nbsp;
hope. It gives me a purpose to keep going knowing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:20.800
that there's people like you out there. And I know&nbsp;
that it it inspires people that that hear you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:26.000
feel relief of, oh my gosh, I can do this, too.&nbsp;
But thank God there's people out there actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.760
doing something because I felt so hopeless. You&nbsp;
will become your own hero. You will help create&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:37.120
many heroes because we all are. We all have the&nbsp;
potential within us to do that. I mean, it's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:42.480
I was just an ordinary guy, but I just didn't give&nbsp;
up. And people said, "Well, you're not ordinary,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:47.360
so fine, maybe I'm not." But that doesn't matter&nbsp;
anymore than who sits in the White House matters,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:52.080
right? Like that's the trouble with with the&nbsp;
people or the problem. Everyone thinks about them&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:59.280
too much. They don't they don't matter ultimately.&nbsp;
Know yourself and act on the heroism that you feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:03.680
and and you'll be a hero, too, and you'll inspire&nbsp;
many others. So, I'm passing that torch on. That's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:09.680
where we're talking today, right? An ordinary man&nbsp;
who has done extraordinary things. And so Kevin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:14.160
tell us where we can connect with you. Let's maybe&nbsp;
remind people of the book recommendations that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:24.160
talked about and then your websites. Governor&nbsp;
and ourselves and um the case for Canada um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:32.080
these get these on Amazon and through my website&nbsp;
murderby.com. I'm at angelfire101protonail.com.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:38.560
and do arrange something in our communities&nbsp;
where um I can come and speak and also send&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:42.640
people to you who are in your area because like&nbsp;
I say, I'll be giving you updates soon about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:47.760
this new declaration of independence, the new&nbsp;
constitutional assembly setting up around America&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:56.480
and the new republic of Albon in England. And&nbsp;
then you're also at Republic of Canada too.org.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:02.880
Thank you. Yes. I want to show um on my channel&nbsp;
and there's also a link that I always put in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:08.720
the show notes um Kevin's incredible documentary&nbsp;
Unrepentant which actually features him features&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:15.440
the voices of survivors sharing their stories and&nbsp;
shares about the systemic genocide as well as what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.680
what they were doing about it at this time and and&nbsp;
the different progresses that they were making.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:24.560
It's just an extraordinary piece of work that has&nbsp;
really stood the test of time and is still so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:30.480
if not more accurate and important today to watch&nbsp;
than even back then. This was way before its time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:35.040
the stuff that you were talking about here, but&nbsp;
and so timely for today for people to learn from.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:40.880
So, I did air this on on my channel, so you can&nbsp;
go and actually watch it right on the channel&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:45.920
that you're watching right now. Um, and he's also&nbsp;
has sort of a more official version that's on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:50.960
different channel that I always link in the show&nbsp;
notes. And then Kevin, you do you do podcasts on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:50.960 --> 01:26:54.640
so many other podcasts right now, including&nbsp;
Sean Atwood, which is amazing because I know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:54.640 --> 01:27:00.640
that that's helping sort of get your work out to&nbsp;
different people in this community on a very large&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:05.440
platform. But you have your own show, too. Could&nbsp;
you talk just a little bit about that? Radio Free&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:14.000
Canada. It's um every first and third Sunday of&nbsp;
every month, and it's at uh 12 noon Eastern time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:21.600
bbsradio.comradio free Canada and we're going to&nbsp;
be using that with the give it as a platform for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:27.680
the new American republic movement starting up&nbsp;
so you'll hear more of those folks there thank&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:33.120
you Emma this has been really fantastic and I know&nbsp;
we'll use this broadcast really well yes this was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:37.600
a a jam-packed episode that I think somebody&nbsp;
could listen to over and over and over again&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:42.160
and a really great one too for all ages like you&nbsp;
said you know some of these shows can be a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:47.360
bit explicit this is a really good one to share if&nbsp;
you do have high schooler kids or you know younger&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:52.080
generations or if you guys are in any groups or&nbsp;
can share this um with people that would find&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:56.960
value in it. I would really appreciate that. Um&nbsp;
I'll have Kevin's books linked below, especially&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:01.600
the three that that we talked about today. Um&nbsp;
that way you guys can go empower yourselves,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:06.400
learn how you guys can take action in your own&nbsp;
communities, and of course support Kevin so he can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:11.280
continue doing this work. It's really important&nbsp;
that we support people creating resources for us&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:16.960
and and Kevin has no shortage of them. Um, you&nbsp;
can also visit Murder by Decree, his website,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:21.200
um, which will take you to his platform or&nbsp;
I should say his page that has a listing of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.720
all of his books. Kevin has tons of books. So,&nbsp;
um, we're just sharing three main ones today,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:32.080
but from his website, you can go check out his&nbsp;
entire library, which is extremely impressive.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:37.840
I'll have his documentary below, his radio show,&nbsp;
all his other websites, Republic of Canada. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.160

a wealth of knowledge and inspiration, and you you&nbsp;&nbsp;
