We put on the belt&nbsp;&nbsp; of truth to protect against lies and deception. We&nbsp; put on the breastplate of righteousness to protect&nbsp;&nbsp; our hearts from the temptations. We put the gospel&nbsp; of peace on our feet to walk in your light, peace,&nbsp;&nbsp; and freedom with the Holy Spirit. We rebuke&nbsp; anxious thoughts. We take up your shield of&nbsp;&nbsp; faith for protection to block and destroy all&nbsp; the darts and threats thrown at us by the enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We put on the helmet of salvation to cover our&nbsp; minds and thoughts, reminding us that we are&nbsp;&nbsp; children of a mighty king. We are forgiven, set&nbsp; free, saved by the blood of Jesus. We take up the&nbsp;&nbsp; sword of the spirit, your living word that has the&nbsp; power to demolish strongholds and is sharper than&nbsp;&nbsp; any double-edged sword. We come to you, Lord, in&nbsp; prayer daily. In Jesus mighty name we pray. Amen.&nbsp;&nbsp; What's up, you guys? Welcome to the Imagination.&nbsp; I'm your host, Emma, and today I'm honored to have&nbsp;&nbsp; back on the show for part two of her testimony&nbsp; series, Satanic Ritual Abuse, Mind Control,&nbsp;&nbsp; Stargate, Freemason, Jesuit, an organized abuse&nbsp; survivor, overcomer, and whistleblower, loving&nbsp;&nbsp; mother, founder of The Quickening Project, content&nbsp; creator and podcast host, faithful servant to the&nbsp;&nbsp; most high, gardener, floral design extraordinaire,&nbsp; singer and songwriter, poetry reader and writer,&nbsp;&nbsp; and absolute inspiration, Kadia. In case you&nbsp; missed Kadia's incredible debut episode on this&nbsp;&nbsp; podcast, it'll be below in the show notes.&nbsp; And here is a brief overview of her life,&nbsp;&nbsp; as well as some things we may be discussing&nbsp; today for part two. Kadia's life began in a&nbsp;&nbsp; web of multi-generational abuse orchestrated by a&nbsp; highle cult with ties to Freemasonry, the Vatican,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Jesuits, and military intelligence programs.&nbsp; From infancy, and possibly even Udo, she endured&nbsp;&nbsp; deliberate trauma designed to fracture her psyche,&nbsp; creating dissociative identity disorder to mold&nbsp;&nbsp; her into a mind-controlled operative. Raised&nbsp; in a seemingly happy Christian family, Kadia's&nbsp;&nbsp; front personality was unaware of the horrific&nbsp; rituals and programming conducted in churches,&nbsp;&nbsp; Masonic lodges, and even a major movie theater&nbsp; that shaped her fragmented identities. These&nbsp;&nbsp; included being trafficked to the Vatican for a&nbsp; luciferian ritual, subjected to electroshock,&nbsp;&nbsp; drowning, and drugging to simulate death, and&nbsp; training in programs like Stargate for remote&nbsp;&nbsp; viewing and espionage. As a child, she was forced&nbsp; to participate in heinous acts, including filming&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff films on a church missing trip under the&nbsp; guise of helping an orphanage. Her abusers,&nbsp;&nbsp; including a 33rd degree Freemason programmer&nbsp; who studied neurology to perfect mind control,&nbsp;&nbsp; exploited her high IQ and spiritual gifts,&nbsp; using children's books like Dr. Seuss and&nbsp;&nbsp; the music and keys of a piano to create&nbsp; a highly organized system of altars.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite this, Kadia's awakening began in her 20s&nbsp; when chronic illness defied medical diagnosis,&nbsp;&nbsp; hinting at trauma-based origins. As memories of&nbsp; ritual abuse flooded back just a few years ago,&nbsp;&nbsp; she faced disbelief from family, friends, and&nbsp; authorities, culminating in a betrayal that cost&nbsp;&nbsp; her everything. Her husband filed for divorce. A&nbsp; protection order barred her from her two children,&nbsp;&nbsp; and her resources were stripped away. The&nbsp; cult's playbook using the Darvo method left&nbsp;&nbsp; her ostracized, gangstaled, and battling self&nbsp; harm programming. Yet guided by her faith,&nbsp;&nbsp; Kadiah found refuge with a supportive family and&nbsp; enrolled in Restoration in Christ Ministries, a&nbsp;&nbsp; program that became a cornerstone of her healing.&nbsp; Kadia's escape was a miracle marked by divine&nbsp;&nbsp; intervention, including surviving a kidnapping&nbsp; attempt. Her faith in Yaw became her anchor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognizing that Christian terminology and music,&nbsp; often used in rituals, can retraumatize survivors,&nbsp;&nbsp; Kadia launched the Quickening Project, a&nbsp; podcast and music initiative. She creates&nbsp;&nbsp; worship music designed to soothe fractured souls&nbsp; without triggering trauma, and she offers a safe&nbsp;&nbsp; space for survivors to reconnect with faith. The&nbsp; project also educates on the realities of SRRA,&nbsp;&nbsp; did and cult tactics, exposing the prevalence&nbsp; in institutions like churches, schools, and&nbsp;&nbsp; even pizza chains used as friends for trafficking.&nbsp; Today, we will be continuing Kadaya's testimony,&nbsp;&nbsp; sharing aspects of her story that weren't&nbsp; discussed last time. And some of those topics will&nbsp;&nbsp; be things like mind control programming locations,&nbsp; psychward experiences, youth method, abuse methods&nbsp;&nbsp; that do not leave marks, and sematic body memory&nbsp; experiences, SRA and scripture, Antarctica,&nbsp;&nbsp; the state sanctioned kidnap of children, and so&nbsp; much more. Kadia's mission is not of vengeance,&nbsp;&nbsp; but of healing and empowerment. Her work addresses&nbsp; the epidemic of hidden abuse, drawing parallels to&nbsp;&nbsp; biblical warnings of lawlessness and false light.&nbsp; By sharing her testimony, she validates survivors,&nbsp;&nbsp; showing them that the cult's tactics, like&nbsp; weaponizing children or inducing despair,&nbsp;&nbsp; are proof of their truth. Her message is&nbsp; clear. Healing is possible through faith,&nbsp;&nbsp; honesty, and with the Holy Spirit. Kadia's&nbsp; story, still unfolding as she fights to&nbsp;&nbsp; unite with her children, is a powerful call to&nbsp; action. inspiring survivors to break free and&nbsp;&nbsp; society to confront the darkness in plain sight.&nbsp; Through things like the Quickening Project,&nbsp;&nbsp; Kadia is not just surviving, she is thriving and&nbsp; turning her pain into a divine purpose to set the&nbsp;&nbsp; captives free. Before wrapping up the introduction&nbsp; of today's guest, I'd like to share just a couple&nbsp;&nbsp; quick reminders and updates. If you're interested&nbsp; in being a guest on the show, if you wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp; share any information privately with me, or if you&nbsp; were interested in submitting a written testimony&nbsp;&nbsp; for my upcoming book series, or to be featured&nbsp; on a Substack article, you can reach out to me&nbsp;&nbsp; via email at imagine a better world 2020@gmail.com&nbsp; or standby survivors protonmail.com.

Your support across all platforms is&nbsp; greatly appreciated, you guys, especially as I've&nbsp;&nbsp; had to shift to alternative streaming platforms&nbsp; such as Rumble and X following the extreme&nbsp;&nbsp; censorship that caused my last YouTube channel&nbsp; to be terminated. I've just recently started a&nbsp;&nbsp; new YouTube channel and you can subscribe to me&nbsp; there at the handle @ imaginationodcast official&nbsp;&nbsp; that I am now streaming new episode premieres from&nbsp; weekly. This transition to multiple platforms is&nbsp;&nbsp; crucial to continue sharing vital information&nbsp; with the public and disclosure community. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; thank you all on the other side of the screen&nbsp; for helping to make the imagination the safest&nbsp;&nbsp; space on the internet for survivor, whistleblower,&nbsp; advocate and educator disclosures. Your support&nbsp;&nbsp; means the absolute world to me and to every guest&nbsp; on this show. So you guys, without further ado,&nbsp;&nbsp; please help me in welcoming back today's guest&nbsp; of honor, voice for the voiceless, woman of God,&nbsp;&nbsp; survivor, warrior, fierce mama bear, walking&nbsp; miracle, anti-child abuse, and survivor advocate,&nbsp;&nbsp; and a woman on a mission to equip other survivors&nbsp; with what to expect when getting out through the&nbsp;&nbsp; power and hope of faith in Christ. The one,&nbsp; the only, Kadia. Kadaya, thank you so much for&nbsp;&nbsp; being here again with us today. I'm so happy&nbsp; to have you back. Thank you. Thank you. Wow,&nbsp;&nbsp; that was a wonderful intro. I'm humbled. Thanks&nbsp; for having me. And for those who've tuned in,&nbsp;&nbsp; thank you. It's an honor to have you back.&nbsp; Your last episode was received so well. And&nbsp;&nbsp; despite the fact that it was a longer episode&nbsp; jam-packed with things, we had so many good&nbsp;&nbsp; comments and it provided so many puzzle pieces&nbsp; for other people and helped them understand some&nbsp;&nbsp; of these big picture things that can be really&nbsp; hard to understand in the little snippets that&nbsp;&nbsp; we see online. So, I'm really thrilled to have&nbsp; you back and just so impressed with everything&nbsp;&nbsp; that you've learned, everything that you've done,&nbsp; all the healing that has taken place in such such&nbsp;&nbsp; a short amount of time, and how you're able to&nbsp; articulate these really, really hard concepts&nbsp;&nbsp; and experiences and things that exist in our&nbsp; world in such a palatable way. So, I'm thrilled&nbsp;&nbsp; to get into some of these subjects today. Um,&nbsp; we do have a lot. So, just to let people know,&nbsp;&nbsp; I did mention some things in the intro. if we&nbsp; don't get to all of them, Kadia did agree to&nbsp;&nbsp; do a part three. So, and obviously I'd want her&nbsp; on again anyways, but um if you don't hear about&nbsp;&nbsp; some of the topics today, we'll bring her back on&nbsp; again happily and dive into some of those things,&nbsp;&nbsp; but we're going to try to cover as much ground as&nbsp; we can today. Um, and one of the topics that that&nbsp;&nbsp; we really wanted to share and and talk a little&nbsp; bit deeper about is the topic of being admitted&nbsp;&nbsp; to psych wards, being called crazy after you start&nbsp; to remember these very real reactions that people&nbsp;&nbsp; in these cults and people around survivors have.&nbsp; Um, that sort of causes the opposite. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we should be embracing survivors with healing&nbsp; and help and helpful therapies that validate&nbsp;&nbsp; their experiences and instead um it's a very&nbsp; real situation that a lot of survivors get&nbsp;&nbsp; treated the opposite and um penalized for what&nbsp; they're remembering. And Kadia is no stranger&nbsp;&nbsp; to pretty much every experience you could sort of&nbsp; imagine somebody having from the success of being&nbsp;&nbsp; received on podcast to how her family treated her&nbsp; when a lot of this stuff started going down. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; Kadai, I'm going to turn it over to you and&nbsp; let you share um your experiences about this&nbsp;&nbsp; and we can kind of dive into this topic&nbsp; that's so relevant for survivors and that&nbsp;&nbsp; normal civilians in society really need to know&nbsp; about. Awesome. So, on the last interview we did&nbsp;&nbsp; uh we did dig into several of the topics that you&nbsp; mentioned which was awesome. I'm going to try not&nbsp;&nbsp; to be redundant uh with some of the anecdotes of&nbsp; information. So, I'm going to pick up where we&nbsp;&nbsp; left off pertaining to the timeline of events um&nbsp; regarding my health journey, some of the symptoms,&nbsp;&nbsp; uh my um the different people that I went&nbsp; to for help. Uh we talked about all of that,&nbsp;&nbsp; what happened, why I am where I am now. Um, but I&nbsp; want to just touch on some of the details of what&nbsp;&nbsp; happened in some of those situations with uh&nbsp; people that I had hoped to be able to trust,&nbsp;&nbsp; family members, uh, the authorities, um, pastors,&nbsp; that kind of thing. Uh, because I want to prepare&nbsp;&nbsp; those who are leaving these situations. And I I&nbsp; see this as, you know, I see that there's a mass&nbsp;&nbsp; exodus right now. Hallelujah. Um out of darkness&nbsp; and in uh to the light of truth by his grace&nbsp;&nbsp; alone. And by his grace, I mean God. And you're&nbsp; going to hear me refer to God um you're going&nbsp;&nbsp; to hear me refer to Jesus in a lot of the Hebrew&nbsp; language because a lot of the English language was&nbsp;&nbsp; um used in my programming. That's something else&nbsp; we talked about last time. Um, and so if you hear&nbsp;&nbsp; me use Yah or Yahwa or Yahweh, I know some people&nbsp; have controversy with that. Um, but that's just&nbsp;&nbsp; what I have tended to use. That's been helpful in&nbsp; my journey. So, if you hear me say that, uh, don't&nbsp;&nbsp; be concerned. I'll just say upfront that my faith&nbsp; is in the God of the Bible, the God of Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp; the one and true risen lamb, um Jesus Christ,&nbsp; Yeshua Hamashiach, uh the Messiah who has come&nbsp;&nbsp; to redeem us from the curse of sin and death and&nbsp; all of the things these cults love, all of these&nbsp;&nbsp; things that they do to enslave us. Um, and he&nbsp; has come to save us, to heal us, and he is coming&nbsp;&nbsp; again to exact justice on this kind of darkness,&nbsp; on these hidden cults, on this wickedness. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and uh, and uh, lead his people home. So, I&nbsp; want to talk about what happened pertaining&nbsp;&nbsp; to my children because that's not something that&nbsp; we mentioned. So, maybe I'll just start there.&nbsp;&nbsp; So uh this is you know one of the hardest things&nbsp; for me to stay present uh to talk about um one&nbsp;&nbsp; of the gifts of dissociation um is uh that I can&nbsp; um you know reach a a level in my point of grief&nbsp;&nbsp; um and then in order to be able to survive I&nbsp; can uh switch um into almost sort of a type&nbsp;&nbsp; of amnesia to be able to focus on other tasks at&nbsp; hand. It doesn't always work. There are a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; debilitating days where I suffer. So, uh, just&nbsp; bear with me. Um, if I, you know, space out or&nbsp;&nbsp; space off, um, just give me a minute just to kind&nbsp; of collect my thoughts and and come back. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, I was dealing with a lot of symptoms and&nbsp; one of those things that I was dealing with was&nbsp;&nbsp; dissociative seizures. uh dissociative seizures&nbsp; that were inhibiting my ability to function,&nbsp;&nbsp; to mother, uh to take care of my home, to work,&nbsp; and to eventually drive. So, there were some years&nbsp;&nbsp; um leading up to my psycho board stay where&nbsp; I was booking appointments with specialists,&nbsp;&nbsp; with neurologists. I had an EEG done to um try&nbsp; to uh establish where some of these seizurike uh&nbsp;&nbsp; electric like symptoms were coming from that were&nbsp; just causing debilitating pain and an inability to&nbsp;&nbsp; function. And um I had I didn't know that there&nbsp; was such a thing as dissociative seizures at the&nbsp;&nbsp; time. And unfortunately um clinicians this is just&nbsp; not something that is widely known about. And of&nbsp;&nbsp; course we know the whole medical establishment&nbsp; um including the the world of psychiatry is is&nbsp;&nbsp; designed to create a a a veil uh of of false&nbsp; help over um people who have who are victims of&nbsp;&nbsp; uh organized abuse especially. And so I wasn't&nbsp; able to get a diagnosis, but this was something&nbsp;&nbsp; that I was dealing with and it is still something&nbsp; that I'm dealing with in my healing journey.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are happening less frequently, but they&nbsp; still happen. And so dissociative seizures,&nbsp;&nbsp; they resemble um they don't they sometimes can&nbsp; resemble epileptic seizures, but not always. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and a lot of the the um symptomology surrounding&nbsp; them is is freezing and an inability to articulate&nbsp;&nbsp; outwardly the the pain and the torment um that&nbsp; is happening inside the body that is causing this&nbsp;&nbsp; seizing, this freezing up. Uh the brain will run&nbsp; on a loop like a broken record. Um and so I had,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, years where this would happen and I&nbsp; would literally be beating my head against a wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; literally beating my head against a wall trying&nbsp; to get my brain to work, my body to work, just&nbsp;&nbsp; so that I could easily move my limbs to get to a&nbsp; bathroom or to go get a drink of water. I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; through through several years of this and it's&nbsp; getting worse and worse and worse and worse and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh nobody seemed to really care or mind. Um, and&nbsp; that's because I realize now they were all a part&nbsp;&nbsp; of this, um, this cult of mind control. And I&nbsp; went through the specifics of of these cults,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, in the last interview. And so, um, I was going&nbsp; through loss of consciousness. I was going through&nbsp;&nbsp; transances, stupers, um amnesia, hyperot seizures,&nbsp; um sometimes muscle stiffness, sometimes tremors,&nbsp;&nbsp; uh a lot of twitching of the muscles. Um and so&nbsp; they are now in the current diagnostic manual of&nbsp;&nbsp; the DSM, uh whatever we think about that, um&nbsp; considered a manifestation of a dissociative,&nbsp;&nbsp; um or conversion disorder. And so they're&nbsp; not actually under the patient's voluntary&nbsp;&nbsp; control and they're, you know, they're thought to&nbsp; represent, you know, the patient, as we might say,&nbsp;&nbsp; to represent their the response to emotional&nbsp; stress. And so basically what had happened&nbsp;&nbsp; is that my programming began to break down as I&nbsp; began to resist the demands of the cult as well&nbsp;&nbsp; as the programs that were installed inside of me.&nbsp; Because when I got a hold of the truth through&nbsp;&nbsp; through Yah's word, through his written word,&nbsp; um that awoke a war from the realm of darkness,&nbsp;&nbsp; from covenants that I had made, that parts of&nbsp; me had made that I didn't know that I had had&nbsp;&nbsp; that personalities had made under duress from the&nbsp; cult under satanic ritual abuse, blood covenants,&nbsp;&nbsp; um oaths that were made uh both under duress&nbsp; and also uh voluntarily. early. And so, um,&nbsp;&nbsp; as I began to go through this process of renewing&nbsp; my mind with his word, because his word is sharp,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's powerful, as a as a two-edged sword, able&nbsp; to divide bone from marrow, the thoughts from&nbsp;&nbsp; the intents of the heart. I went through this&nbsp; soul surgery, and it was shattering, heartending,&nbsp;&nbsp; painful, excruciating. Um, and it led to a nervous&nbsp; breakdown. Uh, because as memories began to&nbsp;&nbsp; surface, because this is what happens when we pick&nbsp; up his word and his light shines in the darkness,&nbsp;&nbsp; uh, the darkness is revealed. And so&nbsp; those who were around me that were&nbsp;&nbsp; uh a couple handlers um and my head programmer um&nbsp; began to crack down on um measures of torture to&nbsp;&nbsp; uh create ultimately a psychotic break that&nbsp; would land me in the hospital. So then I have&nbsp;&nbsp; that on my record now as a uh you know psych ward&nbsp; patient or somebody who is me mentally ill. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; this is what happened. Um, I was in my home. Uh, a&nbsp; friend had found me basically walking into walls,&nbsp;&nbsp; not able to function. Um, and crying out for&nbsp; help because, uh, my children were home and I&nbsp;&nbsp; was unable to find somebody to come over and help&nbsp; me function, including my husband was completely&nbsp;&nbsp; ignoring me. Um there was a a moment where I&nbsp; pleaded that for to him for help not to go to work&nbsp;&nbsp; because I was unable to care for the children.&nbsp; And he just smiled and he said, \"I know.\" And&nbsp;&nbsp; he walked out the door and I went, \"Wow, I am&nbsp; dealing with with a darker psychopathy uh than I&nbsp;&nbsp; realized.\" But that was incredibly validating. So,&nbsp; long story short, and I go we went through some&nbsp;&nbsp; of these details. Um, uh, my friend had called&nbsp; the police to help me exit the house safely, get&nbsp;&nbsp; away from the night, get away for the night. Um,&nbsp; but, uh, my husband had intercepted and charmed&nbsp;&nbsp; them and convinced them that I needed to be&nbsp; medicated and taken to the psych ward. And so, um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I complied. Um and while I was there um they were&nbsp; unable to find anything wrong with me. Um and so&nbsp;&nbsp; um after you know 6 days they had told me to that&nbsp; I could check myself out um anytime. My experience&nbsp;&nbsp; there was really hard um but um it was really&nbsp; interesting. Uh, it was a really interesting&nbsp;&nbsp; way that I was set free because one of the things&nbsp; that my programmer did when I was young was put me&nbsp;&nbsp; in a straight jacket in a simulated psych wart&nbsp; situation to abuse and terrify me um of being&nbsp;&nbsp; in such a circumstance. In the event that I ever&nbsp; began to share some of my memories in the began&nbsp;&nbsp; that I ever in the event that I began to remember&nbsp; the truth then I would be um sent to the psych&nbsp;&nbsp; ward. So he actually broke off the fear of the&nbsp; psych ward. Um God did he broke off the fear of&nbsp;&nbsp; that through the my experience in the psychward.&nbsp; Now I I believe there are a lot of horrible things&nbsp;&nbsp; that happen in these types of institutions to&nbsp; people but that was not my experience. I was I was&nbsp;&nbsp; really protected by uh my heavenly father by Aba&nbsp; um by Yah and um and while I was there um I was&nbsp;&nbsp; actually uh given the opportunity um to help the&nbsp; staff members which was kind of neat. Um, and um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and uh, cuz they, you know, they I was I didn't&nbsp; really want to be sitting still in my bed. I I&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't really want to participate too much in in&nbsp; in some of the activities that they had going on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and so um and this is just by the grace of&nbsp; God alone um I was able to you know be a hand&nbsp;&nbsp; on deck to calm some patients down um that were&nbsp; um flying out of control. Um, and part of this is&nbsp;&nbsp; because I understand programming and a lot of pe&nbsp; a lot of the people that were in the psych board&nbsp;&nbsp; um were simply um not mentally ill but victims&nbsp; of uh organized abuse. And so I I um having gone&nbsp;&nbsp; through this with a programmer, having had learned&nbsp; to do some programming, was able to use some keys&nbsp;&nbsp; in order to help create a more calm, a more safe&nbsp; atmosphere in the psych ward so that some of the&nbsp;&nbsp; patients that were in the sort of higher security&nbsp; uh side of the psych ward were actually able to&nbsp;&nbsp; come and participate with some of the groups&nbsp; group staff. So, as as traumatic as it was,&nbsp;&nbsp; I was kind of in awe and amused at what God&nbsp; was doing in there. And he actually he showed&nbsp;&nbsp; me and validated for me that a lot of what are&nbsp; um perceived as mental illnesses are actually&nbsp;&nbsp; um um consequences that are installed in mind&nbsp; control programming and procedures for people who&nbsp;&nbsp; are trying to heal, who are trying to get help. If&nbsp; you start to remember these programs kick in, they&nbsp;&nbsp; cause hallucinations. They cause the hearing of&nbsp; voices. Um there are parts um you know the whole&nbsp;&nbsp; purpose of DID is to keep a person um from knowing&nbsp; that that they have it right. So if it's in an&nbsp;&nbsp; organized abuse setting, did is created to create&nbsp; the ultimate mind control slave, the ultimate spy,&nbsp;&nbsp; the ultimate assassin, whatever it is that doesn't&nbsp; know that they have these parts inside of them&nbsp;&nbsp; that programmers can bring out by uh certain codes&nbsp; or maybe if they're a sex slave of some sort,&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody can buy your code. They can invite you&nbsp; uh under false pretenses to an event. They'll use&nbsp;&nbsp; the code that they purchased from your programmer&nbsp; wherever your program has been cataloged and then&nbsp;&nbsp; that part that has been programmed to submit to&nbsp; the abuse to perform a task um or to tolerate it&nbsp;&nbsp; or to take that you know comes out and then goes&nbsp; back in after and it's it's not remembered. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, a lot of this stuff I was able to kind of&nbsp; practice and test, oddly enough, as a patient in&nbsp;&nbsp; the psych ward. Um, so I I left the psych ward um,&nbsp; having no diagnosis. Um, I was able to function&nbsp;&nbsp; a little bit better just having had the rest and&nbsp; space from my handler while I was in there. When&nbsp;&nbsp; I got out, I was taken back to my programmer's&nbsp; home uh for six months to stay and recuperate. I&nbsp;&nbsp; said to my handler, and I have to be careful about&nbsp; disclosing specifics of relationships right now,&nbsp;&nbsp; but this will all come forth very soon in&nbsp; technical detail in an affidavit as well&nbsp;&nbsp; as a book. Um, and so we'll talk a little bit&nbsp; about that in a bit, but I begged and I pleaded&nbsp;&nbsp; and I said, \"Do not take me, please. That is too&nbsp; far away from my children. I want to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp; see them. I'm not dangerous. I'm not delusional.&nbsp; I'm just really sick and I'm having intermittent&nbsp;&nbsp; amnesia and memory memory floods.\" So, I begged&nbsp; this person to drop me off at my church because&nbsp;&nbsp; I had read in scripture that if one is sick, you&nbsp; can go to the elders of the church. They'll anoint&nbsp;&nbsp; you with oil. They'll pray for you. If you have&nbsp; any sins, you can confess them and be forgiven&nbsp;&nbsp; um by God, and then that sick person will be&nbsp; made well. And so, I like to do things by the&nbsp;&nbsp; book. I'm I'm a believer. I'm a faithful believer&nbsp; in the word of Yah. So, this person took me to the&nbsp;&nbsp; pastor's office and sat in with me during the&nbsp; meeting. Um, and um I I said to the pastor, um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm really sick. Uh, I believe I'm being abused.&nbsp; Um, I tried to uh take escape for a night with&nbsp;&nbsp; my children to a friend's house and um um Oh,&nbsp; sorry. This is really hard. this is the most&nbsp;&nbsp; the children is the thing with the children is the&nbsp; most dramatic understand. And they said well they&nbsp;&nbsp; said well tell me about the abuse what's going&nbsp; on and I said I don't know I don't remember and&nbsp;&nbsp; I began to cry and I I was just in despair. I kept&nbsp; saying I don't remember. I don't remember. I just&nbsp;&nbsp; know I do not trust this person. Right. Um I do&nbsp; not trust this person and I don't know what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and so the pastor, you know, prayed for&nbsp; me, but I begged. I said, \"Can you please,&nbsp;&nbsp; is there somewhere somehow in the church, is&nbsp; there somebody that I can talk to, somebody who&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe has been through an abusive situation who&nbsp; could pray with me on a regular basis?\" Like, I&nbsp;&nbsp; was just so alone. I needed somebody or something.&nbsp; And um this this pastor um um as it turned out um&nbsp;&nbsp; had been already contacted by my programmer where&nbsp; I was supposed to be and they had decided that no&nbsp;&nbsp; matter what he I was to be encouraged to go back&nbsp; to this place for six months to recuperate and&nbsp;&nbsp; be reprogrammed. and I begged and I pleaded and I&nbsp; said, \"Please, I can't go back to the place that&nbsp;&nbsp; I got sick.\" So, I went there. There was there&nbsp; was nowhere else for me to go. While I was there, um I just fasted and I prayed and I just I just&nbsp; made um a a wall um where I wrote down all of the&nbsp;&nbsp; sins of the the family that I grew up in of of&nbsp; this cult. every sin that I could think of that&nbsp;&nbsp; had been committed in this cult, I wrote on the&nbsp; wall and I fasted and I prayed and based on um&nbsp;&nbsp; inspiration from from Gideon in Judges 5 to7 where&nbsp; he burned down his alt his father's altar to Baal,&nbsp;&nbsp; I just did this and I knew this looks crazy. I'm&nbsp; just fresh out of the psychord. If somebody comes&nbsp;&nbsp; in and they see a wall of sins, uh, everything&nbsp; from gluttony to pedophilia to it was all there.&nbsp;&nbsp; um if they see this, it's going to look crazy.&nbsp; But I didn't care at this point because I knew&nbsp;&nbsp; that I was sharing things that would cause me to&nbsp; be accused as crazy on the veneer personalities of&nbsp;&nbsp; these people. But I knew that their personalities&nbsp; underneath were hearing the message. Whether they&nbsp;&nbsp; were aware of those personalities or not, I don't&nbsp; think they are. Of course, they can't couldn't be.&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew they were hearing the message and that&nbsp; some would retaliate uh vindictively and try to&nbsp;&nbsp; hunt and bury me, but that others would hear the&nbsp; message of hope and see the doorway to freedom&nbsp;&nbsp; and would come and leave this cult eventually.&nbsp; And so I sat there and I fasted and I prayed for&nbsp;&nbsp; days. Um, and I just asked for Abba to come and&nbsp; have mercy, to come and have grace, to come and&nbsp;&nbsp; break down these altars and these covenants that&nbsp; have been made in my family going back, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 generations. And uh through this process&nbsp; uh curses began to lift off me and there was&nbsp;&nbsp; some measure of healing that began to take place&nbsp; not necessarily yet in my physical body but in my&nbsp;&nbsp; um in my mind. Um anxiety began to lift.&nbsp; I began to sleep a little better. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um um as I went through this process um of trying&nbsp; to navigate this this mind control labyrinth and&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to escape it biblically in the in the&nbsp; the location of captivity. I started to notice&nbsp;&nbsp; uh a a change happen in my captors where as I was&nbsp; afraid of my programmer of my whole life, I began&nbsp;&nbsp; to notice there was this shift and he no longer&nbsp; was able to be in the same room as me. I would&nbsp;&nbsp; come into the room and he would scurry out. uh he&nbsp; would not look me in the eyes and I was being very&nbsp;&nbsp; very I was being very much my usual loving um kind&nbsp; self um and and and not bringing forward a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; the things that I was I was wrestling with. Um but&nbsp; I noticed that there was just a tremendous change.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so as I was there for this 6 months um this&nbsp; person uh began to be afraid of me for the first&nbsp;&nbsp; time and that was very obvious and that's the&nbsp; power of the Holy Spirit. That's the power of&nbsp;&nbsp; the light. That's the power of the truth. I was&nbsp; in there now. I had come in on my authority as a&nbsp;&nbsp; priest of the most high Yaheemed by the blood&nbsp; of the lamb and his righteousness, not mine.&nbsp;&nbsp; um through faith that power then came and began&nbsp; to break veils off of me, break curses off of me,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I began to walk in confidence and in authority&nbsp; that all of this has been conquered and can be&nbsp;&nbsp; conquered through the word and through Christ&nbsp; and without even having to engage in this type&nbsp;&nbsp; of dialogue with my handler and my programmer&nbsp; at this location. the physical the the spiritual&nbsp;&nbsp; atmosphere began to change and I could tell&nbsp; that they were afraid of me. And this was proven&nbsp;&nbsp; uh because my programmer um threatened me one day&nbsp; while I was staying there. Um, and he threatened&nbsp;&nbsp; me to be quiet because he could see I was no&nbsp; longer afraid of him and he was getting afraid&nbsp;&nbsp; that I was going to start to speak what he knew&nbsp; he had done to me. And I'd never accused him. I&nbsp;&nbsp; had never told him I remembered. And uh he came&nbsp; to me in the backyard and he said to me that&nbsp;&nbsp; uh with his eyes spinning honestly like a sorcerer&nbsp; uh he said to be quiet and he used a programming&nbsp;&nbsp; code that didn't work anymore. Uh I was initiated&nbsp; in a Masonic lodge under a virtue called quiet&nbsp;&nbsp; strength and that was used to keep me quiet. um in&nbsp; the uh Masonic order. And uh so he kept repeating&nbsp;&nbsp; to me quiet strength and I I kept kind of shruging&nbsp; him off pretending. I wasn't really sure what he&nbsp;&nbsp; was talking about, but I knew. Then he snapped&nbsp; his fingers, which is another which was another&nbsp;&nbsp; uh programming trigger that he had used so that I&nbsp; would make eye contact with him. And he got in my&nbsp;&nbsp; face and he said again, \"Quiet strength.\" and&nbsp; he repeated my name, my my name that was used&nbsp;&nbsp; in the programming and for once I didn't&nbsp; switch and I remained as I am in my new&nbsp;&nbsp; identity in Christ and I just looked him in the&nbsp; eyes with sadness and I kissed him on the forehead&nbsp;&nbsp; and I went for a walk and I praised I just praised&nbsp; Yah on that trail and I just thanked him because I&nbsp;&nbsp; knew in that moment that the curse in my family&nbsp; had finally been broken and that it was only&nbsp;&nbsp; a matter of time for the manifestation of this&nbsp; exodus to take place. And so I'm the first one&nbsp;&nbsp; out. I know there's going to be more to follow.&nbsp; Um, I know some of the promises that Yahw has made&nbsp;&nbsp; to me and I saw the power of the programming&nbsp; break down by his word and his love um, and&nbsp;&nbsp; the gospel alone in that experience. And so I'm&nbsp; very confident that he is going to do the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just have to in just pick up my cross and keep&nbsp; following him and just endure the persecution,&nbsp;&nbsp; the slander, the bearing of false witness, the&nbsp; twisting of different things and also the shame of&nbsp;&nbsp; some things that um are true. Um, and so that's&nbsp; something that I'm continuing to sort of walk&nbsp;&nbsp; through is the the the the giving up of that fear&nbsp; of man, the giving up of that shame to Christ and&nbsp;&nbsp; walking in basically my new identity, my new name&nbsp; in him. And this is exactly the the purpose for&nbsp;&nbsp; which God gave his son for us in order to redeem&nbsp; us from this kind of thing. Because we think that,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, sin, you know, in the Christian church,&nbsp; sin is often just referred to as, oh, don't have&nbsp;&nbsp; sex before marriage or or don't, you know, swear&nbsp; or don't this, don't that, you know, don't don't&nbsp;&nbsp; be intoxicated. But according to scripture, the&nbsp; eventual uh digression or denigration of of sin,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is simply um lawlessness, simply breaking&nbsp; the law of Yahw is eventual denigration into&nbsp;&nbsp; human sacrifice. The reprobate mind of Romans 1.&nbsp; it without without a compass and without a light.&nbsp;&nbsp; We can see through his word that um sin eventually&nbsp; rolls downhill into the depths of this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; satanic ritual abuse and this kind of depravity&nbsp; because these are this this these are the spirits&nbsp;&nbsp; that are at work. This is the dark the dark power&nbsp; that is at work. They need blood. They need human&nbsp;&nbsp; sacrifice. They need perversion. They need these&nbsp; kinds of energies from people in order for them to&nbsp;&nbsp; accomplish, you know, the the agenda of the fallen&nbsp; ones that we read about in Genesis. So, none of&nbsp;&nbsp; this is actually new. It's far more common than&nbsp; anyone knows. It's not a conspiracy theory. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's all throughout scripture. It's all throughout&nbsp; the ancient texts um including Enoch and Josher&nbsp;&nbsp; um and the book of wisdom. I mean it's just&nbsp; everywhere. But there is you know there is hope&nbsp;&nbsp; and I saw his power come through in that situation&nbsp; and restore me to a sound mind. Um and that&nbsp;&nbsp; was really beautiful. But after the psych ward&nbsp; experience and after the the six months um spent&nbsp;&nbsp; at my original reprogram sorry with my original&nbsp; programmer to reprogram me after the psych ward.&nbsp;&nbsp; So that so that happened um in order to reprogram&nbsp; me and it didn't work because the power of God was&nbsp;&nbsp; was greater. After that, I returned back home to&nbsp; be with my children. And I was healthier and freer&nbsp;&nbsp; than I had ever been. And I and I during this time&nbsp; had been calling um women's shelters because I was&nbsp;&nbsp; so desperate to flee. I was so desperate to get&nbsp; away. Um but y'all kept just kept saying, \"Rain,&nbsp;&nbsp; remain, remain. I have work for you to do to do&nbsp; here.\" Um, and he had asked me if I was willing,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I was. And um, and so I I didn't go to the&nbsp; women's shelters. I ended up um, moving back home&nbsp;&nbsp; into the house with my children until the day&nbsp; that I was dumped off out of the country with&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing but a an extra outfit besides the clothes&nbsp; on my back and no warning. Financially cut off.&nbsp;&nbsp; um homeless effectively um with nothing told that&nbsp; my delusions my and my memories were false. Um my&nbsp;&nbsp; husband had said he was going to file for divorce.&nbsp; The divorce papers came through a process server.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and they were not divorce papers. They were a&nbsp; protective order to forbid me from returning home&nbsp;&nbsp; to retrieve any of my belongings or come within a&nbsp; thousand ft of my children. Uh, and this is how we&nbsp;&nbsp; know the judicial system is corrupt because like&nbsp; the police were sent, a process server was sent&nbsp;&nbsp; with all these different types of things and and&nbsp; the the the due process was different than what is&nbsp;&nbsp; actually typical. Um, and so we know, right, that&nbsp; they have they have people positioned in all of&nbsp;&nbsp; these different places. And anyone that is in the&nbsp; cult has relationships with law enforcement. They&nbsp;&nbsp; have relationships with judges, with lawyers. It's&nbsp; not hard to do. And so, um, because I was so sick,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, I did not dispute the protective order, um,&nbsp; because I was unable. I realized at this point to&nbsp;&nbsp; safely return and be anywhere near my abusers.&nbsp; I couldn't heal if I was anywhere around them&nbsp;&nbsp; at this point. And this was now a time for me to&nbsp; pursue healing so that I could be healthy for my&nbsp;&nbsp; children so that I could fight for them so that&nbsp; uh I they will be restored for me to me. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; um I was eventually granted uh a visitation right&nbsp; over the phone because I'm, you know, 5 hours away&nbsp;&nbsp; from them in a different country um in Canada.&nbsp; Um my children are in Washington and they do&nbsp;&nbsp; this intentionally, right? They they have people&nbsp; they you know they select your spouse for you and&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a lot of uh this is really common across&nbsp; the border because in the event that somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; begins to defy the cult um they can uh create a&nbsp; tremendous legal hassle by putting them across&nbsp;&nbsp; the border um where it's difficult to really um to&nbsp; really access any services or access any funds. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; like for example um I can't yeah there's there's&nbsp; just a whole rigomeal of reasons I can't can't&nbsp;&nbsp; even get on disability in order to get financial&nbsp; help or anything like that. Um so it's kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; a nightmare. So I was I was kind of launched I&nbsp; was catapulted out of the country. I was given&nbsp;&nbsp; uh half an hour on Tuesdays to talk to both of my&nbsp; children together on the phone. under supervision. And I did that three times. And um my children&nbsp; were being so closely coerced and handled during&nbsp;&nbsp; our conversations, what I was allowed to&nbsp; say or talk about, what they were allowed&nbsp;&nbsp; to say or talk about that by the third visit,&nbsp; and it's like you're just like it's I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; how stressful is that? You have half an hour once&nbsp; a week on the phone just to see your kids. They do&nbsp;&nbsp; this just to torture mothers. It's just to torture&nbsp; mothers. And my son actually had to lie down. He&nbsp;&nbsp; got sick. Um because I had said to them, \"Do you&nbsp; understand where I went? I I would like to know&nbsp;&nbsp; what you were told.\" Because I wasn't even given&nbsp; the opportunity to say goodbye. I was just dumped&nbsp;&nbsp; off somewhere. Um I said, I you know, it's not&nbsp; my choice to be here. I wanted them to know that&nbsp;&nbsp; I I did not leave them, that I was removed and I&nbsp; was legally being prevented from returning home&nbsp;&nbsp; to see them. And like I just I wanted to have&nbsp; a conversation with him about it and it wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp; even on the table. Um he was hauled out of the&nbsp; room, came back in, said he wasn't allowed to&nbsp;&nbsp; talk about it. Then he got dizzy and had to lay&nbsp; down. This was my nine-year-old who's nine or&nbsp;&nbsp; um a 10 at this at this time. And so after that&nbsp; third time, um I sent a message to my husband&nbsp;&nbsp; and I said, \"I am not agreeing to this anymore.&nbsp; I will speak I will visit with my children. I&nbsp;&nbsp; will speak with my children on my terms or not at&nbsp; all. This is inhumane and this is abusive.\" And&nbsp;&nbsp; um and so um it's been about a year now, almost&nbsp; a year now, and I have not had any contact with&nbsp;&nbsp; them physically or over the phone. I'm not I'm&nbsp; struggling um today um to articulate this in a way&nbsp;&nbsp; that isn't in a a a you know in a way that is um&nbsp; linear um and makes a lot of sense because it is&nbsp;&nbsp; such a grief to me to not have access to them to&nbsp; not be have even been able to have a conversation&nbsp;&nbsp; about with them about where I am or why or what&nbsp; has happened. It is so cruel and so demented the&nbsp;&nbsp; way that I have been treated. Um, and I can't just&nbsp; the trauma. Um, it's just a hard thing to talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about. So, that's why I'm kind of bouncing all&nbsp; over the place. And, and because I have I'm split,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, I have a lot of parts. I have a lot of&nbsp; different things to say. And so, I interrupt&nbsp;&nbsp; myself a lot. And so I just really appreciate&nbsp; the grace of of you who are listening. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I hope you can kind of understand and kind of&nbsp; follow and I I hope there's something um there's&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody out there who who will feel less alone&nbsp; through you know just hearing this experience. But&nbsp;&nbsp; um you know I asked I I had I had requested&nbsp; could I at least get some drawings. My oldest&nbsp;&nbsp; son especially is a just an phenomenal artist. Um&nbsp; that was something really special that we used to&nbsp;&nbsp; do together and we used to bond together over&nbsp; um I was not sent uh anything. Um absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing. No Mother's Day message, no no Mother's&nbsp; Day messages, no drawings, um no um just nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just completely cut off. I wasn't even allowed to&nbsp; mail a gift to their house for their birthdays.&nbsp;&nbsp; um still have no idea what it is that they&nbsp; have been told. Um but I am not mentally&nbsp;&nbsp; ill. Dissociative disorder is a mechanism for&nbsp; survival. It's not a mental illness. Um and I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; angry. I am incredibly angry. But this time, as&nbsp; excruciating as it has been, has afforded me to&nbsp;&nbsp; apply the strategy that I've gotten from the Lord.&nbsp; Um, and it's taken a lot of faith and a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; patience. Not to show all my cards right now. Um,&nbsp; but um, I have to say, Yah is so brilliant and he&nbsp;&nbsp; is so wise. Um, and so I am just clinging to him&nbsp; through faith that he has promised me that what he&nbsp;&nbsp; has been leading me to do during this time is is&nbsp; working. It's going to work. It is such a biblical&nbsp;&nbsp; thing that the enemy ins snares himself in his own&nbsp; traps. He falls in his own pit. He's ins snared by&nbsp;&nbsp; his own devices, his own craftiness, and his own&nbsp; words. Um, and so I'm just clinging in faith, um,&nbsp;&nbsp; as I'm watching this unfold in absolute awe, um,&nbsp; that I am going to be restored with my children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and um, and um, everything that has been done&nbsp; in darkness is going to be exposed and they will&nbsp;&nbsp; know exact they will know the truth. Um, and so&nbsp; that's where I'm at right now pertaining to that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your convictions are so powerful. I get chills&nbsp; whenever I listen to you speak because you really&nbsp;&nbsp; do it from your heart and in such a genuine and&nbsp; authentic way. And you actually didn't skip around&nbsp;&nbsp; at all in my opinion. I thought everything really&nbsp; flowed well. How you were able to explain all of&nbsp;&nbsp; that and how it connected. And I mean just to&nbsp; unpack some of it, you know, this is so common&nbsp;&nbsp; within our community and it's so something that&nbsp; is so shielded from the public on how a survivor&nbsp;&nbsp; is treated after they start to display whether&nbsp; it's physical memories or body memories or you&nbsp;&nbsp; know what could be labeled as a psychosis. Um&nbsp; which is so ridiculous that um survivors could&nbsp;&nbsp; be penalized for that. Of course, if you remember&nbsp; the things that you and others have went through,&nbsp;&nbsp; who wouldn't go into a psychosis? Remembering&nbsp; those things, I mean, just hearing about it&nbsp;&nbsp; could put somebody in a really hard mental state&nbsp; if they they've never heard of some of these uh&nbsp;&nbsp; types of abuses that, you know, children like you&nbsp; had to endure and survive. horrific, you know, but&nbsp;&nbsp; just seeing these playbooks happen over and over&nbsp; and over again and that they happen and they do it&nbsp;&nbsp; in such a strategic way where you hear your story&nbsp; and you see how you're going through life thinking&nbsp;&nbsp; that that the events happening, the people that&nbsp; you're meeting that it's all organic, that there's&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing really coincidental, that this is a path&nbsp; that you chose for yourself, a partner that you&nbsp;&nbsp; chose for yourself, a decision that you made for&nbsp; yourself, and then having to realize looking back&nbsp;&nbsp; that these people were 10 steps ahead of you had&nbsp; planned a way for all of these events to occur for&nbsp;&nbsp; you knowing that the fate would be as soon as she&nbsp; starts remembering. We know she's going to and as&nbsp;&nbsp; soon as she starts um recalling we know exactly&nbsp; what we're going to do. We have all the pieces in&nbsp;&nbsp; place. We have we know what church she might go&nbsp; to. We know what friend might might comfort her.&nbsp;&nbsp; We know her husband is under our control. we know&nbsp; exactly what we're going to tell the children and&nbsp;&nbsp; we know her uh all the resources that she has and&nbsp; we're going to take them away. I mean, it is just&nbsp;&nbsp; mindblowing how strategic this Darvo is. this this&nbsp; abuse after abuse is and how how long in advance&nbsp;&nbsp; they're able to sort of conduct this path to where&nbsp; it can completely sidetrack you to where it's only&nbsp;&nbsp; after the fact you and so many others can say,&nbsp; \"Oh my gosh, I I see now exactly how this was all&nbsp;&nbsp; orchestrated, but they made it feel so organic and&nbsp; so natural that that I was choosing all of this,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and and it's just really horrible.&nbsp; how we're treated, you know, you look at how&nbsp;&nbsp; like a military vet is treated after a war, you&nbsp; know, and all the empathy that that society has&nbsp;&nbsp; for them and how of course there's flaws in that&nbsp; system, too. You know, there's it's definitely not&nbsp;&nbsp; a perfect healing system, but at least society&nbsp; has empathy for that. When a soldier starts&nbsp;&nbsp; sharing that they experienced a lot of really hard&nbsp; things um while in war or while in the military,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, we really accept that as oh my&nbsp; gosh, that's so heartbreaking. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we can't even imagine. But when a survivor comes&nbsp; forward and and says the same types of things that&nbsp;&nbsp; are extremely traumatic and that can literally&nbsp; put somebody into a a state of psychosis or&nbsp;&nbsp; um you know worse because of what they went&nbsp; through. You know, it's really horrible that&nbsp;&nbsp; these families get away with helping orchestrate&nbsp; sort of the perfect cover up of of the abuse&nbsp;&nbsp; that they incurred on the survivor. And so, right&nbsp; from going to a psych ward to knowing, all right,&nbsp;&nbsp; that's on her record. The second she tries to to&nbsp; get the kids or the second that she starts to,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, move away from the family and possibly&nbsp; takes the kids, we have this right on her record&nbsp;&nbsp; that we can go to the courts and use against her&nbsp; and it's going to be in our favor and she doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp; even know it, you know. And it's just so malicious&nbsp; and so sinister how every detail is so carefully&nbsp;&nbsp; orchestrated and that they're literally, you know,&nbsp; seeing years into the future and they're so scared&nbsp;&nbsp; of their secrets getting out that they literally&nbsp; have like a fail safe for every single possible&nbsp;&nbsp; scenario that could possibly happen to where you&nbsp; might share, you know, and and looking at a story&nbsp;&nbsp; like yours, it's just like it leaves your jaw on&nbsp; the floor seeing how many people were involved in&nbsp;&nbsp; orchestrating this and you know how in your mind&nbsp; these were people that should have loved you,&nbsp;&nbsp; should have cared about you, should have wanted&nbsp; you uh to heal and and should have been there&nbsp;&nbsp; supporting you in your time of need. Especially&nbsp; hearing about your husband just leaving whenever&nbsp;&nbsp; you're in despair asking him for help as a parent,&nbsp; you know, and and hearing just the the psychotic&nbsp;&nbsp; nature of his response, you know, you look at&nbsp; all of this and then them contacting a priest&nbsp;&nbsp; before you even get there and having that all&nbsp; planned out in advance, you know, so you you're&nbsp;&nbsp; you can't even go to a place like a church, which&nbsp; should be a safe haven for survivors and get help.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so it's just it's so devastating hearing this&nbsp; and I am so so sorry that they targeted you this&nbsp;&nbsp; way and orchestrated the removal of your children&nbsp; because you are one of the most loving amazing&nbsp;&nbsp; mothers in the whole world. And all I can say is&nbsp; that these people picked the mom the wrong mom to&nbsp;&nbsp; mess with and your children picked the right mom.&nbsp; Your children are so lucky that they have a mother&nbsp;&nbsp; who's going to understand what they went through&nbsp; whenever they get out. Um, they're so lucky that&nbsp;&nbsp; they have a mother who's willing to literally&nbsp; put her life on the line to fight for them. And&nbsp;&nbsp; they're so lucky that they have such a loving,&nbsp; amazing mother on the other side of this who&nbsp;&nbsp; is going to embrace them when they too have the&nbsp; freedom to be able to leave and to be in your arms&nbsp;&nbsp; again. And I just ask everybody that they pray for&nbsp; this, that they pray over you and your family and&nbsp;&nbsp; your children, that not only this gets exposed,&nbsp; but that you get reunited with your children as&nbsp;&nbsp; soon as possible and they can escape the way that&nbsp; you did and not be in the the the strongholds of&nbsp;&nbsp; evil in the spirit as well as in the physical&nbsp; with their family. Amen. Thank you. And I have&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing in and of myself to be able to fight this&nbsp; entity. You know, like you like you you said,&nbsp;&nbsp; Emma, you're right. They have the the capa the web&nbsp; that they weave around um around people so that&nbsp;&nbsp; they can never escape. it goes up to the highest&nbsp; levels um of of even our justice even our justice&nbsp;&nbsp; system. Um and and so I take I take courage in&nbsp; the fact though they haven't picked a fight with&nbsp;&nbsp; me. They have picked a fight with the most high.&nbsp; So they have already lost. Scripture is so clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are countless references um to this&nbsp; kind of activity in scripture and scripture&nbsp;&nbsp; and against especially those who are trying to&nbsp; escape and repent and and come come back to come&nbsp;&nbsp; back to faith. Yahw totally lays them waste. He&nbsp; utterly destroys um those who will not heed his&nbsp;&nbsp; long-suffering and merciful warnings. And when&nbsp; they lay these traps and these these snares um&nbsp;&nbsp; they are the ones that end up entrapped in them.&nbsp; It's just we have to walk in faith. Um and as we&nbsp;&nbsp; do, we start to see that begin to happen. And um&nbsp; and when we react in fear, that's sort of when&nbsp;&nbsp; we become reinsslaved again. um to thinking that&nbsp; that these entities that be are are more powerful&nbsp;&nbsp; um than than the truth. And it's just it's just&nbsp; not it's just not true. And I'm already just&nbsp;&nbsp; the fact that I was able to escape and stand&nbsp; here today um and testify um and having gotten&nbsp;&nbsp; through that rambling little testimony about my&nbsp; children um without switching is a testimony to&nbsp;&nbsp; the glory of Yahw and his power because I&nbsp; could not have done that the last interview&nbsp;&nbsp; we did together. I couldn't even go there. I&nbsp; couldn't even talk talked about everything else.&nbsp;&nbsp; uh but but my children um and so he is you know he&nbsp; is bringing strength you know I found files on my&nbsp;&nbsp; own program in the documents of one of my abusers&nbsp; um and it included um oh I'm so tempted to say&nbsp;&nbsp; the name of it uh but um it's all going to come&nbsp; out um in a in a different in a different forum&nbsp;&nbsp; um but there was there was details in in the&nbsp; technology ology that was being used um uh that&nbsp;&nbsp; was being planned and some really dark stuff. And&nbsp; so um you know Yah knows how to make sloppy joe's&nbsp;&nbsp; out of the Illuminati. Um he really really does&nbsp; because you know as scripture says the fear of&nbsp;&nbsp; Yahw is the beginning of wisdom. unless you fear&nbsp; him, you're not, you know, going to have that kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of you're not going to have wisdom. And so, so I&nbsp; made some discoveries that with his help that were&nbsp;&nbsp; just far bigger than I ever could have imagined.&nbsp; And so I'm I'm working on building my testimony&nbsp;&nbsp; um with details um outside of the eyes of the&nbsp; Roman mob as we're calling it uh to be released at&nbsp;&nbsp; the right time and in the future when the impact&nbsp; will be big enough due to the inclusions uh and&nbsp;&nbsp; the completeness of it. Um I we we um withdrew&nbsp; our podcast uh on the main platform for the time&nbsp;&nbsp; being. It um because of threats being made to the&nbsp; family that was supporting me from my family of&nbsp;&nbsp; origin from the cult. There was just some nasty&nbsp; threats. Um and I don't believe any of them would&nbsp;&nbsp; prosper. Um, but you know, I began to see that&nbsp; as things came into light and I was as I was&nbsp;&nbsp; collecting evidence and as memories were returning&nbsp; that this is way bigger than just me. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and so it's actually good to uh embrace I think&nbsp; a season of hiddenness for the time being. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I do encourage uh people to subscribe to&nbsp; us at the Quickening Project um on YouTube. We&nbsp;&nbsp; are on Spotify at least for the music for now&nbsp; and then for the eventual I pray Yahw willing&nbsp;&nbsp; restoration of of the podcast because we are&nbsp; we are called to obedience to Yahw even against&nbsp;&nbsp; threats and intimidation from the enemy and to&nbsp; proclaim the truth like a city on the hill. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um and so we're just in a season regarding the&nbsp; podcast of of recalibration. Um, and so when it is&nbsp;&nbsp; eventually released, the fullness of my testimony,&nbsp; affidavit, book, and more, and other interviews&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm doing on platforms, just alone uh by myself&nbsp; cuz I have personally nothing to lose now. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; this will then totally expose the camp of the&nbsp; enemy. um they'll be um I I pray brought to&nbsp;&nbsp; their knees so that they can be granted repentance&nbsp; and forgiveness and ultimately salvation. But you&nbsp;&nbsp; know a big shock is coming and you know I've done&nbsp; my best to warn those in the cult many of which&nbsp;&nbsp; as I have said were family friends that I love&nbsp; to repent and seek the truth so they can be on&nbsp;&nbsp; the right side of this exposure when it comes. Um&nbsp; but nobody will venture into the light and they&nbsp;&nbsp; in instead continue to choose to cast shadows on&nbsp; their works in both denial and malicious intent&nbsp;&nbsp; to continue their campaign of slander and threats&nbsp; and vile actions against me against those who have&nbsp;&nbsp; helped me when I was left destitute and by effect&nbsp; uh my children. Um and so um but I do encourage&nbsp;&nbsp; you to come and enjoy the music. It's been such a&nbsp; healing mechanism. Um, we've been writing writing&nbsp;&nbsp; music and and producing it in in 444 hertz, which&nbsp; is just a really powerful healing frequency. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; that is believed to be the key of David. Um, and&nbsp; so, um, yeah, you know, there's so much I want to&nbsp;&nbsp; say. I'm chomping at the bit, but I'm I'm learning&nbsp; to grow in patience and and restraint a and wisdom&nbsp;&nbsp; and to to not um um yeah, I think there's some&nbsp; things right now that have come to light that&nbsp;&nbsp; are better built in secret to avoid, you know,&nbsp; the hassle because I know you haven't received&nbsp;&nbsp; any threats from my, you know, ex family, um&nbsp; but other podcasters and interviewers that&nbsp;&nbsp; um I have um been on have received threats of&nbsp; lawsuits and and things like that. It's all&nbsp;&nbsp; just fluff. I mean, it's not going to come&nbsp; to anything. Um but it's just it's just not&nbsp;&nbsp; worth the engagement and the harassment right&nbsp; now. Um but eventually this disclosure will be&nbsp;&nbsp; nuclear and it will bring healing to me, many&nbsp; others. I believe justice and and vindication. Wow. Oh my goodness. That is amazing that you're&nbsp; working on so much behind the scenes and that you&nbsp;&nbsp; were backed into a corner. Instead of cowering,&nbsp; you took that as a way to empower yourself. Like&nbsp;&nbsp; you said, you have nothing to lose now. They took&nbsp; everything. And so the they actually put you in a&nbsp;&nbsp; position of of power. And I really love that like&nbsp; you can recognize those moments. I especially,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, you told that um in your testimony a&nbsp; little bit earlier about the power exchange while&nbsp;&nbsp; you were at your programmer's house and seeing&nbsp; how his reaction to you went from that of that&nbsp;&nbsp; psychopathic I own her, I control her mentality&nbsp; to, oh my gosh, I do not have control over this&nbsp;&nbsp; person anymore. And I'm terrified of that. I had&nbsp; a guest on my podcast named Carrie Alah and she&nbsp;&nbsp; had said in one episode and it was so impactful.&nbsp; She was like talking about how she would feel now&nbsp;&nbsp; if she saw her abuser and on the streets and how&nbsp; she would feel and she said it's like they build&nbsp;&nbsp; a really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sharp weapon and now it's pointed&nbsp; at them, you know. And she's like that's how I&nbsp;&nbsp; would feel if I walked by my abuser. I wouldn't&nbsp; I wouldn't be scared anymore. He would be. And I&nbsp;&nbsp; was like, gosh, that's such a beautiful, you know,&nbsp; sort of taking your power back moment of of being&nbsp;&nbsp; empowered in those times when they want you to&nbsp; cower and not s uh being susceptible anymore to&nbsp;&nbsp; the fear tactics that they have employed on you&nbsp; your entire life. to be able to to step forward&nbsp;&nbsp; when you should be afraid and be fearless and&nbsp; knowing that you're putting that fear back where&nbsp;&nbsp; it belongs in their eyes and in their hearts&nbsp; and making them cower instead of it being you.&nbsp;&nbsp; And you can really hear that in your voice, you&nbsp; know, and now, I mean, it's it's a it's amazing&nbsp;&nbsp; hearing you and others speak out who are at that&nbsp; point where they're ready because, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; hearing how you describe yourself before and how&nbsp; they, you know, with all the years of of grooming&nbsp;&nbsp; and abuse and torture and programming and where&nbsp; they were able to get you to be in that point&nbsp;&nbsp; where you were more submissive, you know, and&nbsp; and to hear what's on the other side of taking&nbsp;&nbsp; that power back and in in doing that healing work&nbsp; to where you just sound so confident and powerful&nbsp;&nbsp; today and like I can't even picture you any other&nbsp; way. Like I know that this is the way that God&nbsp;&nbsp; intended you to be and to to be able to approach&nbsp; your life, you know, fearless and just incredibly&nbsp;&nbsp; courageous. That Thank you. I appreciate that.&nbsp; It's, you know, it's it's been such a grace and&nbsp;&nbsp; you're totally right. like something broke when&nbsp; I repented and pleaded for mercy and forgiveness&nbsp;&nbsp; um for the perpetrator group that day after the&nbsp; psych ward. Like I like this this looked like I&nbsp;&nbsp; don't know if you've ever seen the movie Homeland&nbsp; with Carrie like one of one she's a detective. It&nbsp;&nbsp; looked like like it was a total red string wall.&nbsp; Like it looked it would have looked to anybody&nbsp;&nbsp; that had seen it or even to myself to think, \"Wow,&nbsp; what what are you doing in here?\" But this this is&nbsp;&nbsp; the thing about the Holy Spirit is he he calls us&nbsp; to do things according to his word. And sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp; those things are really unconventional and they&nbsp; look ridiculous or crazy or foolish to the eyes of&nbsp;&nbsp; men. I mean, Yeshua was was was driven to the edge&nbsp; of a cliff because they were calling him crazy&nbsp;&nbsp; when he was preaching the message of the gospel um&nbsp; and uh talking about, you know, the truth. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp; we have to be kind of willing um to do things&nbsp; according to the leading of his spirit. But&nbsp;&nbsp; you're right, something broke off of me, too,&nbsp; when I began to repent for the sins of my family.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I saw the sh the power shift. I was now the&nbsp; power was now with me. And I the programming was&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer working. The trigger words were no&nbsp; longer working. I was no longer under control&nbsp;&nbsp; of my handler or programmer. And as fear began&nbsp; to grew in grow in them, the power of love and&nbsp;&nbsp; grace and mercy and a desire for justice began&nbsp; to grow in me. And sometimes people have to be&nbsp;&nbsp; brought often low to the brink of absolute poverty&nbsp; of spirit and a recognition of their own depravity&nbsp;&nbsp; and consequences in the realm of the physical&nbsp; in order to rescue them and snatch them from the&nbsp;&nbsp; flames of of hellfire that that that you know our&nbsp; sins have have incurred. Um, and so I whatever it&nbsp;&nbsp; is that Aba would have me do, I will do because&nbsp; I know he will meet me with the power to do with&nbsp;&nbsp; that to do that. And when we fear him, we don't&nbsp; fear fear man. Um, but but that broke down that&nbsp;&nbsp; broke this altar that had been in my family&nbsp; during this process of of fasting and prayer&nbsp;&nbsp; before my red string wall of sins of the cult. and&nbsp; my and somebody in my family actually had found it&nbsp;&nbsp; um in the back of the walk-in closet of the room&nbsp; that I was staying. That was kind of my my warfare&nbsp;&nbsp; and and room of room of intercession at the time.&nbsp; And asked if I was okay. And I laughed and I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Yes, I know this looks bad, especially after&nbsp; just coming out of the hospital.\" Um I said and&nbsp;&nbsp; and I said, \"Would you like me to tell you about&nbsp; it?\" And and this person said he said, \"Sure.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; And I said, \"Well, I'm repenting for the sins of&nbsp; our family.\" Um, and I I I don't have, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; the ability necessarily to repent for the sins&nbsp; of another, but I can bring their sins before the&nbsp;&nbsp; throne um in an offering of repentance for um I&nbsp; believe in in the heart of the lamb who, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; um who bore our sins and ask him to um stir up um&nbsp; to stir up both justice and mercy. see to to end&nbsp;&nbsp; this now. Even if I have to be the first one to&nbsp; bushwack through and get cut and bruised and and&nbsp;&nbsp; beaten, I know that that that that covenant with&nbsp; Satan was broken during that fast and it's going&nbsp;&nbsp; to come to full fruition at some point. I really&nbsp; truly believe that I'm going to see eventually&nbsp;&nbsp; um the rest of my family get saved. I do too. I&nbsp; really feel that way. And I feel like right now&nbsp;&nbsp; is kind of that tipping point, you know, where&nbsp; my hope is you and others who have been speaking&nbsp;&nbsp; out will get the recognition, you know, from the&nbsp; public as well, so they can support you in your&nbsp;&nbsp; in your missions. Cuz historically, it's been sort&nbsp; of the opposite. you know, you get called and gas&nbsp;&nbsp; lit and called crazy from your family and then you&nbsp; go to society and they they call you a conspiracy&nbsp;&nbsp; theorist for talking about this. And I feel like&nbsp; we're really pushing past the hump of those days&nbsp;&nbsp; as well where now people are starting to hear&nbsp; about this more and more and it's starting to be&nbsp;&nbsp; something that makes sense in their minds. They're&nbsp; starting to lose faith in the same authority that&nbsp;&nbsp; rules over them. What a courageous woman you are.&nbsp; You think about all these generations that this&nbsp;&nbsp; went on in your family. All these people just even&nbsp; in your own story, just the few people that you've&nbsp;&nbsp; talked about just on this podcast, all those&nbsp; people, this huge network and web of people,&nbsp;&nbsp; and not one of them ever had the courage to do&nbsp; what you did. And then you look generationally at&nbsp;&nbsp; their parents and all these people's grandparents&nbsp; and all these people's great-grandparents,&nbsp;&nbsp; all these people's children if they have them,&nbsp; or children's children. You know, you look at&nbsp;&nbsp; all the different generations that this spans. How&nbsp; many people are involved in just one testimony of&nbsp;&nbsp; one survivor and that one person in all these&nbsp; generations couldn't take the programming,&nbsp;&nbsp; couldn't comply with the control, couldn't obey&nbsp; the evil and the the spiritual direction that&nbsp;&nbsp; these cults and these families try to lead&nbsp; you into so you can carry it on to the next&nbsp;&nbsp; generation, you know. And man, what a hero you&nbsp; are. You know, it's it really is amazing getting&nbsp;&nbsp; to see that you are holding so much faith and&nbsp; that that you've come so far to where you can&nbsp;&nbsp; carry yourself with with his word and and share&nbsp; that with the with the world and lead with that&nbsp;&nbsp; in a way that that is with integrity and love and&nbsp; compassion, you know, and and the fact that you're&nbsp;&nbsp; looking for every single way to get justice, you&nbsp; know. I hope that that this gives people hope on&nbsp;&nbsp; the other side of the screen as well, hearing&nbsp; you, you know, and hearing your convictions and&nbsp;&nbsp; your positivity and your confidence, you know,&nbsp; and I know that we're all rooting for you on&nbsp;&nbsp; this side of the screen and that we all are here&nbsp; for you, you know, and and I know that whatever&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever direction God is leading you in, whatever&nbsp; strategy he is helping you concoct is going to&nbsp;&nbsp; just be dynamite, you know, and that's my hope as&nbsp; well that the people involved decide to join you,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, ultim Ultimately, there's going to&nbsp; be two groups of people. There's going to be&nbsp;&nbsp; the people who put their hands up and say, \"All&nbsp; right, I was caught. I want to leave. I want&nbsp;&nbsp; to heal. I'm done with this. I've wanted&nbsp; to get out forever and didn't have a way,&nbsp;&nbsp; and now I do. And I want to be like Kadai. I want&nbsp; to be like these other survivors who who healed,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know.\" But there's also going to be the people&nbsp; who will fight till their last breath. They'll&nbsp;&nbsp; fight to the death to take this to the grave with&nbsp; them and want nothing to do with the healing and&nbsp;&nbsp; with with coming over to the other side, you know.&nbsp; And so we'll have to reckon with that. But these&nbsp;&nbsp; conversations, I think, help pave the way for the&nbsp; compassion because ultimately we we hope 100% of&nbsp;&nbsp; the people in these systems will want to take the&nbsp; high road and want to repent and heal, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and that we need to be there with open arms just&nbsp; like how you are when that time comes when this&nbsp;&nbsp; big exposure does happen. um that we're receiving&nbsp; people with love and compassion and and wanting&nbsp;&nbsp; wanting them to go on a healing journey, you know,&nbsp; and not not letting the emotion of how hard these&nbsp;&nbsp; things are that people like you go through affect&nbsp; us in a way that makes us violent and makes us,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, very similar to the same people that&nbsp; we're trying to expose. And you are just such a&nbsp;&nbsp; wonderful example of leading in a way that I wish&nbsp; more people heard. You know, I I really feel like&nbsp;&nbsp; survivors are going to change the world.&nbsp; If everybody could hear these testimonies,&nbsp;&nbsp; there would be a renewed faith in not just&nbsp; God, but I think just in humanity with with&nbsp;&nbsp; reclaiming our empathy, too, you know, and our&nbsp; power. And uh I just want to thank you from the&nbsp;&nbsp; bottom of my heart for demonstrating the way&nbsp; that you do because you're just it's really&nbsp;&nbsp; beautiful listening to you talk about these&nbsp; things as hard as it is. Wow. you know, in um yeah, I'm I appreciate the encouragement. Um I'm&nbsp; you know as you're speaking I'm remembering in uh&nbsp;&nbsp; 2018 when I was um a new mother and afraid for my&nbsp; children and and wanting uh freedom for them from&nbsp;&nbsp; from these generational uh just generationally&nbsp; handed down cult activity. Um I was on my face uh&nbsp;&nbsp; in prayer and um Yahw said to me, \"Are you willing&nbsp; um you know and I didn't understand the full scope&nbsp;&nbsp; of what he of what was about to happen at this&nbsp; time. Um but I knew I was going to lose everything&nbsp;&nbsp; and I began to shake and tremble in fear.\" And so&nbsp; I want to just mention this as as we talk about&nbsp;&nbsp; courage because yes, courage is so important.&nbsp; But I shook and I trembled in in fear and I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Yes, yeah, I am willing, but I am terrified and I&nbsp; need you to make me brave.\" Um, and so I just like&nbsp;&nbsp; lay on my back and I just cried in a a position&nbsp; of just surrender with my heart up and I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I need you to do surgery on my heart to purge&nbsp; me of fear of man.\" because I just I just knew&nbsp;&nbsp; that I was going to for the next 7 to 8 years&nbsp; and and possibly longer begin to hemorrhage&nbsp;&nbsp; everything that was near and dear to me because of&nbsp; my obedience and because of the task that he had&nbsp;&nbsp; asked me to begin back then to bring um exposure.&nbsp; Um and um you know it so courage is often I think&nbsp;&nbsp; doing things scared doing it scared you know when&nbsp; Gideon was visited by the angel of the Lord and&nbsp;&nbsp; told to burn down his father's altar to Baal he&nbsp; was terrified and shaking and you know I kind you&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a funny passage in Judges 6-7 the angel finds&nbsp; him in a panic attack and and says oh mighty man&nbsp;&nbsp; of valor. And and that's just the spirit of of our&nbsp; Yah of Yahwa is he's so meek and gentle and lowly&nbsp;&nbsp; and humble as awesome and mighty and powerful&nbsp; and terrible and as fearsome as he is. He sees&nbsp;&nbsp; us. We may be doing things knock need scared and&nbsp; trembling. But when we obey faith rather than fear&nbsp;&nbsp; and we take that step even if we're terrified, he&nbsp; calls us brave. He calls us a man or a woman that&nbsp;&nbsp; is mighty and full of valor. And so I want to just&nbsp; encourage that uh for anyone who is listening who&nbsp;&nbsp; who who may feel weak um that um it's okay to feel&nbsp; the fear and to choose not to obey it and walk in&nbsp;&nbsp; faith anyway. It doesn't mean that you are not&nbsp; brave. It doesn't mean that you are not strong.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's it's actually the opposite. And um if if&nbsp; you are being led to expose um an evil or wicked&nbsp;&nbsp; scheme for the sake of setting captives free,&nbsp; um you can do that by by his power and through&nbsp;&nbsp; his word and and through faithful obedience&nbsp; and coming into a covenant um with Christ uh&nbsp;&nbsp; the way that he tells us to do it in his word.&nbsp; It's just incredibly simple. It's not easy. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it is simple. And it's actually a mercy to the&nbsp; perpetrator group to expose them. Um, it's a mercy&nbsp;&nbsp; not just to those that they have been harming or&nbsp; have harmed, but it's a mercy to them as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; um even if we're angry um so that they don't carry&nbsp; this to the grave so that Yahw may bring them low&nbsp;&nbsp; that they may repent and be saved. You know, he's&nbsp; not going to do that. He doesn't call, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and choose everybody. Um um but there's a lot of&nbsp; just there's a lot of people who will be exposed&nbsp;&nbsp; and they will still refuse to to repent. Um but&nbsp; there is no sin too grievous for uh the blood&nbsp;&nbsp; of the lamb to be able to completely wash away.&nbsp; And so we have to be willing um to obey him um no&nbsp;&nbsp; matter the cost for the sake of those we love cuz&nbsp; a lot of our perpetrators, you know, we have, you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, have split us, right? So we have parts that&nbsp; really love them. Parts that may be um working&nbsp;&nbsp; through unforgiveness, harboring bitterness and&nbsp; resentment that we have to we have to with his&nbsp;&nbsp; help um give up to him because justice is his&nbsp; and he will repay. But we do love these people,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know. We really do love these people. I'm&nbsp; not out to accuse anybody. Um, I'm just walking&nbsp;&nbsp; one step at a time according to his leading. And&nbsp; And so, um, yeah, we're going to we're going to&nbsp;&nbsp; encounter fear. We're going to be tempted to to&nbsp; to not um to not walk in courage because there's&nbsp;&nbsp; going to be warfare, right? Spiritual warfare&nbsp; um is intense. We don't fight against, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; human beings, but but powers and principalities,&nbsp; uh, not flesh and blood. And so, we really have to&nbsp;&nbsp; do this with the help of his word and the sword of&nbsp; the spirit. And there's a lot of other types of um&nbsp;&nbsp; paths that people will take uh that will seem to&nbsp; work for a while, but ultimately, you know, when&nbsp;&nbsp; we when we get to the end the end of this road, if&nbsp; we're counting on the methodologies of this world&nbsp;&nbsp; or other other, you know, uh or the um faculties&nbsp; of man, we're going to or the righteousness of&nbsp;&nbsp; ourselves, we're going to ultimately come up&nbsp; up short. And so that's the freedom of all of&nbsp;&nbsp; this is that we don't walk through this based on&nbsp; our own courage or our own righteousness at all,&nbsp;&nbsp; but on the righteousness of him who who gives his&nbsp; righteousness to us so that we can stand through&nbsp;&nbsp; this. And and you know, we chatted a little bit&nbsp; the last three days and I'm I'm going through it&nbsp;&nbsp; right now. Like you probably hear my my voice is&nbsp; different from the last few times we have spoken.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been under such uh spiritual warfare&nbsp; leading up to just this interview uh because&nbsp;&nbsp; the powers and principalities are petrified.&nbsp; And I had I had even been visited by an entity&nbsp;&nbsp; uh that identified itself as Abdon um under the&nbsp; name Abdon um uh a couple of nights ago that came&nbsp;&nbsp; into where I was sleeping the minute I lay down um&nbsp; in my bed and began to choke and strangle me and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh threaten me that if I threaten me not to&nbsp; speak. Um, and so, you know, this this stuff&nbsp;&nbsp; is real. This stuff is intense. And we're going to&nbsp; feel those dark energies. We're going to feel the&nbsp;&nbsp; fear. Um, and so we really really really really&nbsp; This is why I'm so passionate about this because&nbsp;&nbsp; if it weren't for the word of Yah, I would not&nbsp; have survived to the point of being alive right&nbsp;&nbsp; now. And there were times I didn't want to survive&nbsp; it, but I would have rather been dead than have&nbsp;&nbsp; to go through all of this. And I'm still deeply&nbsp; deeply suffering um as I'm navigating this. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; but without his word, I would not have been able&nbsp; to survive the spiritual warfare. I would not have&nbsp;&nbsp; learned the armor of of Yahw in Ephesians that&nbsp; you reference in your opening prayer often, Emma.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so there's just no other way. And regarding,&nbsp; you know, exposure, um, you know, I think about&nbsp;&nbsp; the woman at the well who was so astonished and&nbsp; bewildered by Christ when he visited her who he&nbsp;&nbsp; was drawn towards this woman in her sinful state&nbsp; and he appeared to her first and he just laid her&nbsp;&nbsp; sins before her. the sins that all the sins that&nbsp; she these sin this pattern of sin that she had had&nbsp;&nbsp; in her life and she's simply going about her life&nbsp; uh you know undoubtedly laden with the burden of&nbsp;&nbsp; her sin whether she knows it or not and and he&nbsp; comes up to her and he unpacks her sin before&nbsp;&nbsp; her without even an introduction in just the most&nbsp; bewildering way because our Messiah is so good and&nbsp;&nbsp; so loving and so merciful and he's stirred with&nbsp; compassion and good news and he didn't approach&nbsp;&nbsp; her to condemn her for it. Um but to tell her of&nbsp; her need for the living water as she's drawing&nbsp;&nbsp; water from this well for his living water which is&nbsp; his word which is themselves so that she never you&nbsp;&nbsp; know thirsts again. And my favorite part is how&nbsp; she responds. She ran back to the village to tell&nbsp;&nbsp; everyone. You know what would have happened if&nbsp; she'd been offended when Christ told her about her&nbsp;&nbsp; past when he lay her sins before her? What? She&nbsp; She could have denied it. She could have feared&nbsp;&nbsp; the light shining into her darkness before. The&nbsp; only one who could really see and know the depths&nbsp;&nbsp; of her heart and her past and everything she'd&nbsp; ever done. She could have defended herself. She&nbsp;&nbsp; could have made excuses, tried to cover up her&nbsp; shame. She could have been angry, offended. She&nbsp;&nbsp; could have run from this only water that could&nbsp; wash her sin and make her new. But she didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; choose to hide in shame because the savior came&nbsp; to take it from her with his love and with his&nbsp;&nbsp; holiness. And so that's the love of our savior and&nbsp; that's how I want to be and that's how I try to be&nbsp;&nbsp; when I am presented with conviction. Um whether&nbsp; through somebody else or if I'm confronted by his&nbsp;&nbsp; spirit or whether just through his word as I read&nbsp; it, I want to be like her. I want I don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp; reject it. I don't want to reject um reject it.&nbsp; I don't want to fall back into the bondage of&nbsp;&nbsp; scrambling to atone for myself or to hide um or&nbsp; to hide it or you know because otherwise I would&nbsp;&nbsp; carry on in the slavery of my ignorance until the&nbsp; reckoning day. And this is how I see these members&nbsp;&nbsp; of of the cult that so many of us are so livid&nbsp; with and disgusted by um but yet love at the same&nbsp;&nbsp; time because a lot of these people are family,&nbsp; spouses, people we have grown up with. Um and so&nbsp;&nbsp; um you know maybe I don't know why I'm sharing&nbsp; this. Maybe maybe there is maybe a family member&nbsp;&nbsp; is going to locate this interview. Maybe a member&nbsp; of the cult. And so this may be a message held out&nbsp;&nbsp; to these individual that we to these individuals&nbsp; that that we perish on the ground of our our own&nbsp;&nbsp; righteousness, but by his stripes were healed. And&nbsp; unless we try to mop it up and brush it under the&nbsp;&nbsp; like if we try to mop it up and brush it under the&nbsp; rug, you know, we might be white as bleach through&nbsp;&nbsp; the eyes of man, but not white as snow, not washed&nbsp; clean, completely forgiven, emancipated as if we&nbsp;&nbsp; had never sinned. And I had done a lot of horrific&nbsp; things in the cult. And um he took my shame from&nbsp;&nbsp; me through humility and through repentance.&nbsp; It's it's his loving kindness that brings us&nbsp;&nbsp; to repentance. And and so and so I just I hold&nbsp; out this this spring of water welling up with&nbsp;&nbsp; eternal life. And for anyone listening now you&nbsp; know where where the well is. Amen to that. And&nbsp;&nbsp; once again, another beautiful lesson of overcoming&nbsp; something that can be so debilitating for people,&nbsp;&nbsp; that shame and guilt. Um, I had on my podcast one&nbsp; time Harry Alah again, but she had said one of the&nbsp;&nbsp; ways she started reckoning with her own shame&nbsp; was imagining some of the the abuse situation&nbsp;&nbsp; she was forced to perpetrate in and imagining&nbsp; a police officer standing there as a witness to&nbsp;&nbsp; it without the abuser knowing. And she said if if&nbsp; that was the case and there was people there that&nbsp;&nbsp; could persecute, if they were looking at the&nbsp; situation, who would they persecute? the the&nbsp;&nbsp; child, the the young person that's forced by the&nbsp; hand of an adult to commit a crime or the adult&nbsp;&nbsp; forcing the child. And she's like, obviously&nbsp; they they wouldn't go send a child to jail if&nbsp;&nbsp; they saw an adult coercing them, whether through&nbsp; mind control or physically with their own hands,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, to per to perpetrate. You know, I think&nbsp; that's a really important part of this journey is&nbsp;&nbsp; being able to look at that through different eyes.&nbsp; you know, I can't even imagine the heaviness of of&nbsp;&nbsp; having to even look at it at all, you know,&nbsp; much less the feelings and emotions that it&nbsp;&nbsp; must bring up. But it's it's really important&nbsp; I think that you know we cross that that line&nbsp;&nbsp; at some point you know and and try to let that&nbsp; go too and and put that shame and guilt where&nbsp;&nbsp; it belongs because you know without the mind&nbsp; control without manipulation without grooming&nbsp;&nbsp; without this generational abuse happening&nbsp; if all of that didn't exist in the family&nbsp;&nbsp; nobody would have ever been put in a position to&nbsp; begin with that would involve perpetration. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's wonderful once again and hopefully that gives&nbsp; people hope on the other side of the screen who&nbsp;&nbsp; are carrying that, you know, that now might be&nbsp; the time to let that go and to really look at&nbsp;&nbsp; it through a different lens as emotional and&nbsp; painful as those moments can be. to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp; see it through different eyes and to see it in a&nbsp; way that helps represent you in your good heart,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and putting that back to where to where&nbsp; it belongs. And to to really understand that that&nbsp;&nbsp; coercion, manipulation, mind control, um amnesia&nbsp; to what you're doing, drugging, that those things,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, aren't something that that you should&nbsp; be carrying guilt for. you should be pointing&nbsp;&nbsp; the finger at somebody and saying, \"Why the heck&nbsp; would you do that to a young person, to a child,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and put them in those positions and give&nbsp; them those things and do those things to them,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know. So, it's really wonderful to see that&nbsp; you've come so far in your healing journey to&nbsp;&nbsp; be able to breathe more free and to get to take&nbsp; that weight off of you, you know, and to throw it&nbsp;&nbsp; off because you can tell in your voice you sound&nbsp; very light and more at peace, you know, and even&nbsp;&nbsp; though there may still be work to do, there might&nbsp; still be a whole lifetime of work to do, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; being able to take some of that weight off even if&nbsp; it doesn't fix every single little thing can just&nbsp;&nbsp; be so tremendously important in in a journey of&nbsp; healing when there's so many different boulders on&nbsp;&nbsp; that somebody wears and carries every day. I pray&nbsp; so you know his yoke is easy and his burden is&nbsp;&nbsp; light. He says, \"Come to me all who are weary and&nbsp; heavy laden and I will give you rest. I am I am&nbsp;&nbsp; gentle and lowly.\" And and that's how he describes&nbsp; himself and that's how he is for those who will&nbsp;&nbsp; come in humility and in need. uh for those who who&nbsp; will who firmly remain in rebellion and defiance&nbsp;&nbsp; um are going to meet are going to meet uh the side&nbsp; that is to be greatly greatly feared. Um and so I&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah I pray you know um yeah I pray so I think&nbsp; about you know I'm thinking about my oldest and&nbsp;&nbsp; and um I'm thinking about you know we see things&nbsp; in our children sometimes we see generational&nbsp;&nbsp; patterns being passed down despite our best&nbsp; efforts that can be sometimes concerning or or&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes frustrating and we think I don't want&nbsp; you to have to suffer this in this way the way&nbsp;&nbsp; that I did. And I and I remember um I had taken&nbsp; my children to the museum in Lynen, Washington&nbsp;&nbsp; um which is a tremendous occult town and um u they&nbsp; but they love the museum there and I just thought&nbsp;&nbsp; it might be an interesting educational experience.&nbsp; I had just taken them out of school to homeschool.&nbsp;&nbsp; And this was right before I was um ostracized&nbsp; and and marooned by my family. They they were&nbsp;&nbsp; so scared of my coming to a knowledge of the truth&nbsp; and my growing independence that they had to they&nbsp;&nbsp; had to put in place that protective order just to&nbsp; keep me away. The grounds of the protective order&nbsp;&nbsp; were ridiculous. There there there were no there&nbsp; were no proper grounds. my my faith and and my&nbsp;&nbsp; delusions because I'm very open and I talk about&nbsp; spiritual warfare and I do operate in in prophetic&nbsp;&nbsp; gifts. They were so terrified they had to have a&nbsp; protective order just to keep me from just to keep&nbsp;&nbsp; me away, just to keep away the light and figure&nbsp; out what the heck they were going to do. That that&nbsp;&nbsp; was what it was for. I mean, I'm not violent. I'm&nbsp; not going to hurt them. Um but they just couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; bear to have me around and they knew that they&nbsp; had lost. Otherwise, they wouldn't have done this.&nbsp;&nbsp; so they could continue to have access to me, to&nbsp; continue to exert control, to continue to keep me&nbsp;&nbsp; under their thumb, but they knew they had lost. So&nbsp; they had to they had to get me just get me as far&nbsp;&nbsp; away as possible. And so I say hallelujah to that,&nbsp; but um I suppose that was a bit of a rabbit trail,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I I was at the museum with my children and&nbsp; we came across a a Freemason exhibit about the&nbsp;&nbsp; Freemasons in town. Um, and they had their creepy,&nbsp; you know, all the creepy, it was, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp; it was w mannequins with faces, too. You know,&nbsp; those old mannequins with faces wearing the the&nbsp;&nbsp; Freemason aprons and the table with the Holy Bible&nbsp; and the dagger and some of the ritualistic items&nbsp;&nbsp; that the Masons use. And my youngest said, \"Oh,&nbsp; mom, look over here.\" He said, \"What is this?\" And&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, \"Oh.\" I said, \"Yeah.\" He said, \"Oh, it's&nbsp; creepy.\" And I said, \"You're right. It is creepy.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; And so I I I gave him a very simple answer.&nbsp; I said um you know there there are people&nbsp;&nbsp; uh who Yeah. Well, I said I pointed out the Bible&nbsp; first. I said, \"Yeah, you see the Bible with a&nbsp;&nbsp; dagger on it.\" And and he said, \"Yeah, what's that&nbsp; about?\" And you know, he was eight at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um he had just turned eight. And I said, \"Well,&nbsp; there there are a lot of people in in the world&nbsp;&nbsp; who use the Bible.\" um and pretend to be, you&nbsp; know, they profess to be Christians. They say&nbsp;&nbsp; that they believe in God and they believe a lot&nbsp; of the things that are in the Bible, but they&nbsp;&nbsp; actually use it for secret um and bad purposes.&nbsp; And I just gave him a super simple explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp; And my oldest son didn't even want to look at&nbsp; the exhibit. He just wanted to keep walking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and um we were in the car after and he he was&nbsp; really quiet. Um and he's he he he brought it up&nbsp;&nbsp; um the the Masonic exhibit and and he said, \"Mom,\"&nbsp; he said, \"we have to tell them. We have to tell&nbsp;&nbsp; them.\" And I just I couldn't even speak for for&nbsp; a moment. And eventually as we're driving home,&nbsp;&nbsp; this conversation's taking place. And I I just&nbsp; said, \"We will. We will.\" And so, um, on some&nbsp;&nbsp; level, my children know, um, they know. They know&nbsp; the truth no matter what they've been told. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp; I I know that I have done my best despite my dis&nbsp; own dysfunction, despite my own guilt that has&nbsp;&nbsp; been absolved, despite um my own um inability that&nbsp; I have done my best to teach and train my children&nbsp;&nbsp; in the faith so that they will have, you know, in&nbsp; order to prepare them essentially for my eventual&nbsp;&nbsp; departure, you know, which of course has been this&nbsp; past year. And so I I do take comfort and that&nbsp;&nbsp; helps me on those grievous nights not to fall into&nbsp; despair and remember that I that as long as you&nbsp;&nbsp; know I continue to operate in faith um they will&nbsp; be protected and that part of an the inheritance&nbsp;&nbsp; um of a child of Yah is um you know restoration&nbsp; is a blessing ing upon all the generations uh that&nbsp;&nbsp; will follow. And so that's why it's really&nbsp; important for us as as mothers or or maybe&nbsp;&nbsp; fathers in some cases to to be willing to be the&nbsp; first one to say it stops here. It stops with me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and that will have a trickle down effect upon&nbsp; our children as well. He will bless them. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; I have full and total confidence as painful as it&nbsp; is and as much as I miss them every single day um&nbsp;&nbsp; that that is there's going to be such a a mighty&nbsp; reunion um at the right time and so I look forward&nbsp;&nbsp; to that. We all look forward to that. And for&nbsp; people listening, is there anything at all that&nbsp;&nbsp; people can do to support you? I know you haven't&nbsp; gone public with all of this yet. Um, I know that,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, there's still a level of anonymity that you&nbsp; are keeping to protect yourself at the moment,&nbsp;&nbsp; even though I know that that that'll change soon.&nbsp; Um, but is there anything that that people can do&nbsp;&nbsp; to support you in your quest to get your children?&nbsp; If there's anybody listening that could have a&nbsp;&nbsp; resource or anything. Thank you for asking. Um,&nbsp; I appreciate it. at this moment in time. Uh the&nbsp;&nbsp; the best way you could bless me would be to come&nbsp; and enjoy um the music that um I've been writing&nbsp;&nbsp; and producing uh with two others. Um and um you&nbsp; know if you are moved uh to extend a hand of help,&nbsp;&nbsp; you you can contact me uh on Instagram at&nbsp; thequickening or um the quickening project.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um I I don't you know I don't ask for money.&nbsp; I don't ask for anything like that. But after&nbsp;&nbsp; the last interview, somebody uh one or two people&nbsp; did reach out to ask if I had a GoFundMe that they&nbsp;&nbsp; might be able to help support the cost of living&nbsp; um you know pay for any medical bills um potential&nbsp;&nbsp; legal legal fees and that sort of thing. And so I&nbsp; do have a GoFundMe page. You could even probably&nbsp;&nbsp; Google it. Kadaya GoFundMe if you're moved. Um&nbsp; I would just be incredibly blessed. Um but you&nbsp;&nbsp; know I I really don't I don't like you know asking&nbsp; for money. Um, at this point I I am um I am um you&nbsp;&nbsp; know I'm not lacking in my basic needs that he Aba&nbsp; is providing for me um every day um you know and&nbsp;&nbsp; so I'm just kind of learning to trust um that he&nbsp; is my provider and he has been doing that through&nbsp;&nbsp; just the kindness and the generosity of others. Um&nbsp; there's just a lot of there's a lot of darkness in&nbsp;&nbsp; the world, but there's a lot of goodness, too. Um&nbsp; so yeah, thanks. I appreciate that. Um you could&nbsp;&nbsp; pray um you could pray for continued um strength,&nbsp; wisdom, uh provision. Um I you know you know it's&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting with the divorce the when my husband&nbsp; had said and I went through the conversation this&nbsp;&nbsp; conversation in the last interview that he was&nbsp; filing for divorce and uh then basically just&nbsp;&nbsp; hung up the phone and I wanted to ask if there was&nbsp; a gun to his head. Turned out not to be a divorce&nbsp;&nbsp; protective order. Divorce papers still a year&nbsp; later have not come and I would happily sign them.&nbsp;&nbsp; believe me. Um and I and um and so um um this is&nbsp; I believe for the reason of simply not wanting to&nbsp;&nbsp; divide up our assets to continue to make sure that&nbsp; I lack um but you know my you know thanks be to&nbsp;&nbsp; Yah um you know as he says if he's our shepherd&nbsp; we lack nothing and um so that turned out to be&nbsp;&nbsp; true but that's kind of a there there I'm kind of&nbsp; in a no man's land regarding that. And um I can't&nbsp;&nbsp; go into some of the reasons why I'm making the&nbsp; the the decisions legally that I'm making right&nbsp;&nbsp; now. It's all going to be explained um later&nbsp; as certain things are established. Um some of&nbsp;&nbsp; these things will seem foolish to the world and&nbsp; and the ways of man. But I have a strategy that&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been given to from from the kingdom of heaven&nbsp; um that I have to faithfully walk out and follow&nbsp;&nbsp; um until I see it come to full fruition. And and&nbsp; so far it's going really well, exactly as Yahw&nbsp;&nbsp; had said that it would. And that really moves me&nbsp; too that people went out of their way to ask you&nbsp;&nbsp; because we didn't talk about that last time. So,&nbsp; I'm really grateful that I asked today and and I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; really happy that you put together a GoFundMe and&nbsp; that you have music that people can support um in&nbsp;&nbsp; these different ways that you know people can jump&nbsp; on your journey and help you grow whether it is as&nbsp;&nbsp; an artist or in your pursuit of justice. You know,&nbsp; many of us hate asking for money or for help. But&nbsp;&nbsp; what I've come to realize is so many people have&nbsp; more than they need and want. They feel good about&nbsp;&nbsp; giving and but they're stuck with nonprofits.&nbsp; They're stuck with uh you know political campaigns&nbsp;&nbsp; like so many people are putting money places&nbsp; because it makes them feel good and it's a genuine&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to help in some way. I I work I have kids.&nbsp; I can't quit everything and jump on board but I&nbsp;&nbsp; have $5. I have $100. I have a few thousand.&nbsp; I have a job or an opportunity or I can hire&nbsp;&nbsp; them or I need their services and can pay them for&nbsp; it. You know, there's so many different ways that&nbsp;&nbsp; people just genuinely feel helpless and want to&nbsp; help. And I don't think there's any shame at all&nbsp;&nbsp; in being being somebody who can receive that, you&nbsp; know, because we want you to continue your pursuit&nbsp;&nbsp; of justice. We want all if you have to go to&nbsp; court and fight, we want you to have every single&nbsp;&nbsp; penny that you possibly need so finances aren't&nbsp; something that stops you. We want you to have&nbsp;&nbsp; support so you have a community that that you can&nbsp; lean on. We want you to have podcasts that you can&nbsp;&nbsp; go on and be able to share that aren't going to&nbsp; ostracize you or diminish your story in some way.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, we want people to support your music so&nbsp; you can eventually, if you're not already getting&nbsp;&nbsp; paid for that, you know, make that into something&nbsp; that can also be a way for you to provide for&nbsp;&nbsp; yourself. You know, so many survivors are in a&nbsp; place where it can be really destabilizing to go&nbsp;&nbsp; work a nineto-five job in a society that doesn't&nbsp; yet understand or accept them. And especially, you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, with with flashbacks or wherever somebody&nbsp; is in their journey, it can be really difficult&nbsp;&nbsp; to potentially face that whenever you're supposed&nbsp; to be in a professional environment or, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; in these different environments that just they're&nbsp; not so accepting of of somebody's pain and trauma.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so it's always my hope that we can create and&nbsp; pave ways for survivors to be able to whistleblow&nbsp;&nbsp; and to share their story and to seek justice and&nbsp; to put together campaigns and to have, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we pay people for every other job. Like what&nbsp; is more important than advocating for children,&nbsp;&nbsp; for your children, for the children of the world,&nbsp; for people in the cult to come out to educate the&nbsp;&nbsp; world on the evils that exist and that we can help&nbsp; change that and make the world a better place,&nbsp;&nbsp; shine a light on all the darkness and eradicate&nbsp; it. that we can all come together and support&nbsp;&nbsp; something good and that not all hope is lost&nbsp; and that we can educate survivors waking up&nbsp;&nbsp; so they're not harming themselves, you know, and&nbsp; teach them about programming like we need you on&nbsp;&nbsp; the front lines, you know, and if people can have&nbsp; five, 10, 15, 100, however many dollars, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; or just a social media page where they can share&nbsp; your music and encourage people to go follow it,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, it it it really does so much to to help&nbsp; this movement go forward. So you're not taken away&nbsp;&nbsp; from your mission and so you can pursue it with&nbsp; all your might knowing that you know you're not&nbsp;&nbsp; going to be stopped by something like finances or&nbsp; you know whatever it is a resource and so I really&nbsp;&nbsp; encourage people to go support you know if you&nbsp; don't have money support her music go hit follow&nbsp;&nbsp; on Spotify you know become a subscriber on YouTube&nbsp; those little things too can really help somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; in their mission help them get visibility share it&nbsp; on your social media page and if you feel called&nbsp;&nbsp; to donate financially Um, I will have her GoFundMe&nbsp; page 100% right in the show notes, no matter what&nbsp;&nbsp; platform you're on. And even if you guys can't&nbsp; donate, um it's also free to go share that on&nbsp;&nbsp; your social media and you can help campaign for&nbsp; her, you know, and and help her seek justice to&nbsp;&nbsp; get her children, you know, and and maybe there's&nbsp; some people in your social media feeds who have&nbsp;&nbsp; some extra money and and who are really looking&nbsp; for somewhere to put it, you know, we need to&nbsp;&nbsp; put it in the in the pockets of survivors and&nbsp; not into these corrupt people stealing money on&nbsp;&nbsp; behalf of survivors. You know, we think we're&nbsp; doing all this good and we're really not. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, Kadia, thank you for sharing all of that.&nbsp; I there's no problem at all and and and just&nbsp;&nbsp; offering it as a way for people to help, you know,&nbsp; and there's obviously lots of other ways that&nbsp;&nbsp; people can support you, too. And I want everybody&nbsp; to support you so you can continue this journey.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you. I I appreciate that. And it's it's it's&nbsp; true. We need to support one another because fear&nbsp;&nbsp; of lack and fear of scarcity is what keeps a lot&nbsp; of people quiet. and afraid to leave uh handle the&nbsp;&nbsp; the cult, you know, or their handlers because they&nbsp; strategically will set it up so that you actually&nbsp;&nbsp; don't, you know, um yeah, you they're they have&nbsp; a handle on all the finances, right? And so,&nbsp;&nbsp; um it's tempting, right? Cuz all I had to, Emma,&nbsp; all I had to do to get my kids and my life back&nbsp;&nbsp; and access to my bank account was say, \"Yep, I'm&nbsp; mentally ill. These were delusions and these were&nbsp;&nbsp; were false memories.\" That's all I had to say. And&nbsp; there may be situations where where people are led&nbsp;&nbsp; to act like David did when he was fleeing King&nbsp; Saul as King Saul was trying to murder him. He&nbsp;&nbsp; uh he pretended to um he pretended to act&nbsp; in he pretended to go insane, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; or when Rahab lied to the spies in order to,&nbsp; you know, in the book of Joshua in order to hide&nbsp;&nbsp; uh and protect the mission of y, you know, Israel&nbsp; at this time. So, so there there are times where&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe Yahw will have us do these these types&nbsp; of things. Um, so I don't want to encourage&nbsp;&nbsp; people to just go out there and belligerently&nbsp; belligerently start splashing around um the&nbsp;&nbsp; truth of things that they remember or things that&nbsp; they know without a wisdom. Um, but if we can,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, help, you know, collectively support&nbsp; one another, whether it's me or another survivor,&nbsp;&nbsp; that will help them to say, \"No, no, yeah, I&nbsp; may lose everything. I may lose my children.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, but if I stay quiet and if I don't leave the&nbsp; cult, I can never get them out. We can't help&nbsp;&nbsp; them. We cannot protect our children if we stay&nbsp; in. And so ye so the best way that we can support&nbsp;&nbsp; one another really truly is um I think like&nbsp; however yah would lead if it's, you know, I've&nbsp;&nbsp; been incredibly blessed. For example, I'll tell&nbsp; you just an absolute miracle um that happened. I&nbsp;&nbsp; mentioned I had had no clothes where I was where&nbsp; I was dropped off. I was I didn't have a car,&nbsp;&nbsp; not enough money um to buy the things I needed.&nbsp; And so I prayed. I said I said, \"Aba,\" I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I would love for you to supernaturally provide&nbsp; for me a wardrobe.\" Um I I said, \"I just you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know what I would like. You know what&nbsp; would fit. You know what would feel good,&nbsp;&nbsp; what would feel comfortable. You know what&nbsp; you would find me beautiful and lovely in.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know what would what I could wear that would&nbsp; dignify me. And a lot of these these parts of me,&nbsp;&nbsp; especially the littles in my personality system&nbsp; that have been so severely defiled, I said, you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, what would help dignify us and help us walk&nbsp; a little taller, a little straighter, feel good,&nbsp;&nbsp; um feel like a person again? um and what would&nbsp; would testify and and witness um of your goodness&nbsp;&nbsp; to others as a as a child of God. And so I prayed&nbsp; this in the winter and uh this this past month I&nbsp;&nbsp; have had the opportunity to stay with a with a&nbsp; friend um just a really close beloved sister of&nbsp;&nbsp; mine. Um and um unbeknownst to me in since I had&nbsp; prayed that prayer um she had begun to shop for&nbsp;&nbsp; me. Um and she put together an entire wardrobe of&nbsp; beautiful natural fiber cotton and linen garments.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and she brought them and and and um um they&nbsp; just they fit like a glove. And so there's just&nbsp;&nbsp; like an example that might seem like in the&nbsp; grand scheme of things, not a big deal. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; but just those small things can go a long way.&nbsp; Even if you have like extra clothes or all you&nbsp;&nbsp; can afford to do is shop at the secondhand store.&nbsp; Um, you can pray and ask Aba what it is you could&nbsp;&nbsp; do to bless that person and he will pick out a&nbsp; need for them that is so specific. He will reveal&nbsp;&nbsp; to you a prayer uh of their heart that nobody else&nbsp; has heard that he will use you to answer. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wanted to give a little testimony of that.&nbsp; That is so so amazing. And you know I I think it's&nbsp;&nbsp; going to resonate with a lot of people who do&nbsp; feel compelled. You know every a lot of people&nbsp;&nbsp; want to help. A lot of people want to help. They&nbsp; just don't because they don't know what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp; They don't realize that help can be so simple.&nbsp; It can be a prayer, you know, it can be going&nbsp;&nbsp; to a secondhand store, you know, and hearing&nbsp; that, I hope, is sort of directing people in&nbsp;&nbsp; a way that can help them be creative with what&nbsp; they can do, whether they have limited time,&nbsp;&nbsp; limited finances. You know, we can all step up and&nbsp; help. And we really have to get to a point where&nbsp;&nbsp; we're leaving these old systems behind where it's&nbsp; greed and ego and, you know, authority ruling and&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of the slavery system that we're in where,&nbsp; you know, we are the ones that are sort of at the&nbsp;&nbsp; disposal of the people ruling over us. And we need&nbsp; to look at all the people in our communities and&nbsp;&nbsp; around us and and see how we can take care of each&nbsp; other because they're not doing it for us, you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, and and if anything, they're they're really&nbsp; penalizing the the people who suffer the most. You&nbsp;&nbsp; know, there shouldn't be a single person in this&nbsp; world who's homeless or who doesn't have food,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, when you look at all the wealth and&nbsp; all all the food that exists and water, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's an atrocity that that somebody anybody is&nbsp; without a home or without a drink, you know, or&nbsp;&nbsp; without healthcare. But unfortunately, that's the&nbsp; world that we live in where, you know, basic needs&nbsp;&nbsp; are some of the most expensive and uh hard to get&nbsp; things sometimes when you're going through a hard&nbsp;&nbsp; time like what you are where you have people&nbsp; actively keeping you from being resourced and&nbsp;&nbsp; financed and with the ability to get the help that&nbsp; you need and the support that you need, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and and the fact that you've had to navigate&nbsp; all this yourself just blows my mind. Like I&nbsp;&nbsp; can't as a grown adult. I can't even put myself in&nbsp; your shoes of thinking about contending with with&nbsp;&nbsp; the memory recollection with all the things in&nbsp; internally that that you've had to go through and&nbsp;&nbsp; and heal through and then on the external world&nbsp; all the things that happened to you at the same&nbsp;&nbsp; time, you know, and being completely abandoned&nbsp; by really any anybody or anything that could be&nbsp;&nbsp; of help for you, you know, and support. And so I&nbsp; just I mean there's nobody more courageous or or&nbsp;&nbsp; more strong or more willful or persistent or&nbsp; brave than survivors, you know, and we have&nbsp;&nbsp; so much to learn from that of how resilient we&nbsp; all are and that we can all get through these&nbsp;&nbsp; hard times no matter how much we want to give up,&nbsp; you know. And one other thing I wanted to to talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about regarding these topics, you had sent over&nbsp; some photos and you had talked about, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we we don't fight against flesh and blood, we&nbsp; fight against powers and principalities, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I think some of the experiences that you have&nbsp; sort of blend those two, you know, we can feel&nbsp;&nbsp; physical symptoms from spiritual disease almost,&nbsp; you know, which makes us believe that maybe our&nbsp;&nbsp; bodies are are ill when in fact Sometimes these&nbsp; spiritual attacks and the way that um our trauma&nbsp;&nbsp; can manifest can be through our flesh and blood&nbsp; and can make it seem physical when it's actually&nbsp;&nbsp; an energy trying to seep through you know or a&nbsp; spirit that is um you know inhabiting our bodies&nbsp;&nbsp; or attacking us you know and so I wanted you to&nbsp; share a little bit about that as well because I&nbsp;&nbsp; think a lot of people suffer with that. I think&nbsp; a lot of um people get misdiagnosed for symptoms&nbsp;&nbsp; of trauma versus actually having a disease or a&nbsp; condition that doctors are trained to diagnose&nbsp;&nbsp; people with. Um and you actually have some photos&nbsp; here, like I said, that we can share to help&nbsp;&nbsp; educate people, you know, and especially survivors&nbsp; who might be experiencing something similar to&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of look at health and trauma a different&nbsp; way of how it can manifest in our bodies. Yeah. Yeah. Would you like to bring up some of&nbsp; those photos and we can Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh so so an AB reaction um for those who don't&nbsp; know is when your trauma when you're processing&nbsp;&nbsp; trauma and memories come to the surface to be&nbsp; released um the body will um sometimes not always&nbsp;&nbsp; um manifest in a in a visual way the type of abuse&nbsp; that was perpetrated from the memory. Most people&nbsp;&nbsp; will experience this is in sensations or pains,&nbsp; distress emotionally and physically tension in&nbsp;&nbsp; their muscles. But there are a lot of cases&nbsp; of AB reactions that and this is common where&nbsp;&nbsp; people will even start you know bleeding from&nbsp; a a specific orifice that was maybe raped or&nbsp;&nbsp; mutilated or brutalized or a bruise will rise&nbsp; to the surface. Um I have lots of examples of&nbsp;&nbsp; these but a couple of them that I have shared um&nbsp; with you here um this one is uh puncture wounds&nbsp;&nbsp; from the uh admin from um from a few different&nbsp; things. Uh one was an extraction of adrenochrome&nbsp;&nbsp; um that happened to me in childhood uh up till&nbsp; about the age of eight. You're not when I was&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer a viable use for it. um as well as&nbsp; injection uh sites for the administration of&nbsp;&nbsp; anesthesia um drugs and there's a lot of poking&nbsp; and proddding and needling with uh electric&nbsp;&nbsp; currents that go through various parts of the skin&nbsp; and if you're dealing with a particularly unhinged&nbsp;&nbsp; um yeah I had very methodical programmer and I&nbsp; also had one who was very unhinged who would like&nbsp;&nbsp; willy-nilly um just poke right with these needles&nbsp; um in order to just create uh shocks and distress&nbsp;&nbsp; um for conditioning certain behavioral uh&nbsp; responses that were desired for the program. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and so these are a couple of examples of just some&nbsp; of the holes that came to the surface of my skin&nbsp;&nbsp; um, while I was um, receiving um, some counseling&nbsp; and and ministry um, from somebody in my support&nbsp;&nbsp; system um, and I would manifest the pain,&nbsp; yell ouch, and then the uh, the sight of&nbsp;&nbsp; the administration of the needle in the memory was&nbsp; brought to the surface of my skin which was quite&nbsp;&nbsp; astonishing for onlookers. It really is. And I&nbsp; think it's really fascinating, too. You hear over&nbsp;&nbsp; and over again how when somebody figures out what&nbsp; the lingering pain manifesting in the body is,&nbsp;&nbsp; if they can get the memory that it's from um&nbsp; and understand what what is bringing that to the&nbsp;&nbsp; surface, what actually happened like that could&nbsp; look to somebody else like maybe an insect bite,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, or something they could label it as&nbsp; where when you actually have the the tangible&nbsp;&nbsp; memory of whatever it was that physically hurt&nbsp; you, many times and maybe you can attest to this.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've heard that these reactions go away. So these&nbsp; things that manifest once you pour acknowledgement&nbsp;&nbsp; into it and heal the memory and sit with it a&nbsp; lot of times these lingering things that could&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe be diagnosed as say a chronic rash or a&nbsp; chronic disease or something that you have to&nbsp;&nbsp; go on medication for forever, you know, they can&nbsp; heal themselves through memory work. It's really&nbsp;&nbsp; remarkable. In fact, I I I believe most diseases,&nbsp; especially chronic inflammation or chronic&nbsp;&nbsp; um illnesses, autoimmune disease,&nbsp; chronic inflammation in the body,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of those are manifestations of&nbsp; trauma. Um and they need to come up and out and I just I'll move on to the next one. Yeah,&nbsp; that's just another example of the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; That one's a little easier to see because uh some&nbsp; of the needles were really big, like wide gauged,&nbsp;&nbsp; very wide gauge needles uh that were used. Oh my&nbsp; gosh. And it it really is like it's just it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp; phenomenal to me that something like that can&nbsp; pop up on your body out of the blue seemingly,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, even though we know why it does. But&nbsp; it's like h it's just amazing how strong memory&nbsp;&nbsp; is, you know, to really just like sit with&nbsp; that for a minute and to think how powerful&nbsp;&nbsp; our memories are that it can bring about something&nbsp; physical on our skin like a wound, a needle wound,&nbsp;&nbsp; a big needle wound because we're remembering&nbsp; something that happened in our past that our&nbsp;&nbsp; past can literally show up on our body in a&nbsp; moment. I mean, it's just incredible how how&nbsp;&nbsp; behind the times we are with with this and how&nbsp; many people could benefit from knowing this,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, from whether it's a trauma, a traumatic&nbsp; event or life like what you grew up in or,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, different types of trauma andor abuse or&nbsp; medical trauma that people have gone through and&nbsp;&nbsp; the different ways that that our medical system&nbsp; is gaslighting and abusing people even unknowingly&nbsp;&nbsp; that these doctors are just doing what they're&nbsp; taught, you know, and it's just really wild.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is a really important you know kind&nbsp; of slideshow that you've created for us. Uh so this this example on the screen you see a&nbsp; burn like a burn mark on my hand. So that is an&nbsp;&nbsp; ab reaction from an electrode burn and the size&nbsp; of the electrode as you can see covers most of&nbsp;&nbsp; my hand. Uh because these electrode pads, this&nbsp; was from a memory where electrode pads um I was&nbsp;&nbsp; really little and so the electro pads were huge.&nbsp; You know, my hand like I was toddler age so these&nbsp;&nbsp; but these were like a big adult-siz electrodes&nbsp; and so they use the hands and feet a lot and so&nbsp;&nbsp; that's why the electrode burn covers so much of&nbsp; the hand. Um, yeah, cuz I was just so young. And&nbsp;&nbsp; so this this Yeah, there's another picture of it.&nbsp; The next couple of pictures are are from this AB&nbsp;&nbsp; reaction. Um, so one of the things that I've one&nbsp; of the reasons we've been writing and producing&nbsp;&nbsp; music in 444 hertz in the key of David using the&nbsp; word of Yah, we're um releasing actually a song&nbsp;&nbsp; tonight, a new song tonight. Uh, so we get we're&nbsp; going to um most of the song drops that we are&nbsp;&nbsp; having these days have been on YouTube because&nbsp; we're uploading um our first album to Spotify&nbsp;&nbsp; um probably in the next couple months and then&nbsp; the second one um is is uh forthcoming. But as&nbsp;&nbsp; we were listening to this music, this is an&nbsp; example of how powerful this frequency is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, I began to get flashbacks and memories in&nbsp; the studio uh during the production process,&nbsp;&nbsp; especially not just um the the singing process,&nbsp; but the production process. And so I was in the&nbsp;&nbsp; studio and suddenly this jolt of electric energy&nbsp; rushes through my body and burns my skin. And I&nbsp;&nbsp; it was so so sharp and shocking, no pun intended,&nbsp; that I screamed, \"Ow!\" And then um uh I was asked&nbsp;&nbsp; if I was okay and I said, \"Yeah, the pain came&nbsp; and left. It left as soon as it was gone, but it&nbsp;&nbsp; came with the flashback of this memory of being uh&nbsp; tortured with electroshock.\" And uh and I looked&nbsp;&nbsp; down and uh right where these electrode pads had&nbsp; burned the most in my memory as I was experiencing&nbsp;&nbsp; this flashback, this rash erupted to the surface.&nbsp; And then you'll see here the last p is the same uh&nbsp;&nbsp; event, but it had kind of begun to scab over. Oh&nbsp; my goodness. And how long, for example, this one,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure it's different for every reaction that&nbsp; manifests physically like like these ones do that&nbsp;&nbsp; we're showing. How long do these typically last&nbsp; to where you're feeling the pain or you're feeling&nbsp;&nbsp; what happened in your memory? It's completely&nbsp; dependent based on the memory. I have had&nbsp;&nbsp; memories that have come forth that have left me&nbsp; in a crippling pain and an inability to function&nbsp;&nbsp; and a lot of distress as it was coming up and&nbsp; out um for for weeks. And then others is just a&nbsp;&nbsp; moment. Um and it just it really kind of depends.&nbsp; There's there's a lot more to um that I I still&nbsp;&nbsp; need healing from that I can feel. um um needs to&nbsp; come out, but that happens when we're ready for&nbsp;&nbsp; it. Um otherwise, we have a psychotic break or you&nbsp; know end up in in the psych ward or or with severe&nbsp;&nbsp; amnesia in a similar way that I mentioned in the&nbsp; last interview with that whole story. But yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's um it's quite fascinating and I know it&nbsp; sounds like oh that's really nice. I I you know I&nbsp;&nbsp; don't want people to be afraid to go listen to the&nbsp; music there. I'm not saying you're going to start&nbsp;&nbsp; to have flashbacks and experience horrific ab&nbsp; reactions. Um, but this has just been the process&nbsp;&nbsp; of of of what Yahw has been doing with me through&nbsp; through his spirit is that when we are ready and&nbsp;&nbsp; we are in the process and ready for memories to&nbsp; return and needing amnesic barriers to come down&nbsp;&nbsp; by his divine hand, he will do it for he will do&nbsp; it at a pace that we're ready for it. And so the&nbsp;&nbsp; music has been a really helpful uh has been really&nbsp; helpful to me in this in this process because it&nbsp;&nbsp; can be very tormenting. And as David soothed Saul&nbsp; with his playing when he was being tormented by&nbsp;&nbsp; evil spirits, um we do have access uh to that same&nbsp; kind of power. You know, it's not a magic spell.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um there are a lot of different frequencies,&nbsp; but when we're walking in faith and obedience&nbsp;&nbsp; and a covenant with the most high yah through&nbsp; faith in Christ, um we can sing in the key of&nbsp;&nbsp; David ourselves. We can produce and tune our&nbsp; instruments to 444 hertz and we can start to&nbsp;&nbsp; watch those amnesic barriers fall and that trauma&nbsp; come to the surface so that we can work through&nbsp;&nbsp; it and process through it with a with a you know&nbsp; ideally the Holy Spirit he's our he's our good&nbsp;&nbsp; counselor and you know his ministry is sufficient&nbsp; but we often have people in supporting roles&nbsp;&nbsp; um not everybody is able to do that and So&nbsp; if that's not you, it's okay. His grace um&nbsp;&nbsp; is sufficient. But if you Google for example um if&nbsp; you Google put into a Google search uh um if you&nbsp;&nbsp; put into a Google search uh battles music battles&nbsp; and music in the Bible you will get a hundred&nbsp;&nbsp; different Bible verses and examples of Satan's&nbsp; army of darkness being utterly smited smold&nbsp;&nbsp; utterly destroyed just through the instruments,&nbsp; just through the worship, the tambourines or&nbsp;&nbsp; the singing or the the music, the worship and the&nbsp; praise of the people of Yah, the people of Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, you'll see examples where he actually&nbsp; sends to the very front lines of the battle,&nbsp;&nbsp; the scariest place to be, where you face the&nbsp; most onslaught, the most resistance. He senses&nbsp;&nbsp; musicians up front. That is the kind of power&nbsp; that we have in him to not use um carnal weapons&nbsp;&nbsp; but spiritual ones. And so this has been my story&nbsp; with the music and why I'm so eager and passionate&nbsp;&nbsp; to write and produce it and use his word. Um&nbsp; and all of us here together, the three of us,&nbsp;&nbsp; the three of us here together that are producing&nbsp; it are experiencing a ton of healing. A ton of&nbsp;&nbsp; veils are being ripped. Laura Sanger, who I'm&nbsp; sure many of your listeners may or may not&nbsp;&nbsp; have heard of, who wrote No Longer Enslaved, she&nbsp; talks a lot about the power of frequency and and&nbsp;&nbsp; of praise and and of worship um in Healing. And&nbsp; unfortunately, a lot of Christian music out there&nbsp;&nbsp; has been intentionally twisted by the deceiver&nbsp; to be in the wrong frequency or to include um&nbsp;&nbsp; a false or a twisted doctrine um to actually keep&nbsp; veils in place. Many Christian songs are used in&nbsp;&nbsp; programming and that was the case for me. And so&nbsp; um that's just something to pray for discernment&nbsp;&nbsp; about. and your music, like how she said, it's on&nbsp; YouTube, it's on Spotify, so you guys can connect&nbsp;&nbsp; with her. Um, and I encourage you guys, too. I&nbsp; mean, especially if you're a survivor and you're&nbsp;&nbsp; wanting to heal, music is something that that&nbsp; helps calm you or that that you love. I think&nbsp;&nbsp; on some level music is so incredibly healing for&nbsp; all of us or at least we think it is, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's really terrible how they have tampered&nbsp; with the frequencies over time and how our music&nbsp;&nbsp; is it might feel consciously like it feels good,&nbsp; you know, but internally it's it's sort of going&nbsp;&nbsp; into our body in a way that acts as a toxin and&nbsp; we might not even know it. And so I love that&nbsp;&nbsp; you're helping us detox with music that is in the&nbsp; right key and is in the right note and frequency,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, because that is so healing. We hear&nbsp; all the time about people buying these different&nbsp;&nbsp; frequency machines just to keep in their home&nbsp; to elevate the frequency of the of their home&nbsp;&nbsp; and their environment right directly, you&nbsp; know, around them and encompassing them.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think that it's it's just something really&nbsp; important to think about that we don't, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and we're s we're always surrounded by Wi-Fi and&nbsp; these, you know, 5G and these frequencies that&nbsp;&nbsp; want to harm us. So, one of the best ways to help&nbsp; combat that is by, you know, doing the opposite,&nbsp;&nbsp; putting on a frequency, having frequency around&nbsp; you, listening to high frequency music that that&nbsp;&nbsp; is detoxing the the harmful effects of all the&nbsp; different negative frequencies that are around&nbsp;&nbsp; us. And I really love that you, you know, I'm&nbsp; really surprised that more people aren't doing&nbsp;&nbsp; what you're doing, but I really think it it was&nbsp; meant for you to do so you could bring that to&nbsp;&nbsp; the forefront. I couldn't think of a better person&nbsp; to help introduce this concept than you, you know?&nbsp;&nbsp; But whenever you learn about this frequency and&nbsp; you learn about how toxic so much of our music is,&nbsp;&nbsp; it just makes you question like how how are&nbsp; more people not defying that? Like everybody's&nbsp;&nbsp; defying all these other aspects of society.&nbsp; chemtrails and pesticides and GMOs, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; but when it comes to something that affects us on&nbsp; a cellular level 24 hours a day like frequency,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, we're we're not fighting for that, you&nbsp; know, as hard. And so, I love that you're coming&nbsp;&nbsp; into that conversation with a solution, you&nbsp; know, and one that that fights with love and&nbsp;&nbsp; compassion and and, you know, sort of gets gets&nbsp; us on the right track. It's really amazing. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; I do encourage people to go follow your work, you&nbsp; know, especially hearing what you went through and&nbsp;&nbsp; seeing these photos, actual visuals of ways&nbsp; that energies were negatively impacting you,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and realizing the the strength that we&nbsp; can fight that with with something like music.&nbsp;&nbsp; Amen. Yes. It's been been huge. I was I was in&nbsp; a state of absolute despair because this is such&nbsp;&nbsp; an overwhelming process to go through healing&nbsp; discovering that you have a dissociative disorder&nbsp;&nbsp; or have multiple personalities and then you're&nbsp; trying to escape the cult and then you're in a&nbsp;&nbsp; safe place and they're still pursuing your life&nbsp; and it it's just absolutely overwhelming to have&nbsp;&nbsp; to navigate through. And so I was pleading with&nbsp; with Yah um with my sister who produces writes&nbsp;&nbsp; and produces the music with me what there's got to&nbsp; be a key. There's got to be a key. You say in your&nbsp;&nbsp; word, to you I give the secrets of the kingdom if&nbsp; you're walking in righteousness and faith. And he&nbsp;&nbsp; said immediately, he said, it's the key of David.&nbsp; And uh so we just poured ourselves into the music&nbsp;&nbsp; as a first priority. And it's just also just been&nbsp; so much fun. I love that. And I think it's just so&nbsp;&nbsp; creative that you thought outside of the box, even&nbsp; right down to the words that you use, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and using non-triggering words. Um, I think&nbsp; that this will keep growing in our community,&nbsp;&nbsp; especially Oops, I just skipped the wrong one.&nbsp; Um, it'll keep growing in our community and&nbsp;&nbsp; and become a need that people see more and more&nbsp; that that can be healing for them. So, I'm really&nbsp;&nbsp; proud of you and really excited to watch your&nbsp; journey with this music unfold. And like I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll have all of that in the show notes for you&nbsp; guys. And hopefully some of you feel validation&nbsp;&nbsp; too seeing these different photos. And I'll have&nbsp; you share about this one too, but I know a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of survivors go through these AB reactions and&nbsp; and have a lot of different health issues that&nbsp;&nbsp; can probably be very easy to be dismissed or&nbsp; misdiagnosed. So, um I'm really happy that&nbsp;&nbsp; we're able to see that your documentation of of&nbsp; your own uh reactions so we can actually sort of,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, understand something that we're never&nbsp; taught about trauma and how it can manifest. Yeah, thank you. This is a video here um as you&nbsp; can see of an AB reaction while uh processing and&nbsp;&nbsp; remembering um electroshock therapy. This&nbsp; is something that happens really commonly&nbsp;&nbsp; um not just on the shoulder but on my legs and&nbsp; any area of my body where any electrode was put&nbsp;&nbsp; uh you'll see this type of manifestation. And so&nbsp; this will happen often um during a flashback or&nbsp;&nbsp; um after you know a deep session of of&nbsp; ministering prayer. Oh my gosh. I have heard&nbsp;&nbsp; of a lot of people who say that they get, you&nbsp; know, what they think are like muscle spasms or&nbsp;&nbsp; um twitches, you know, and um it's really helpful&nbsp; to be able to potentially pair a memory with that&nbsp;&nbsp; and and or to sort of think outside the box of&nbsp; maybe it's not that you're low on electrolytes&nbsp;&nbsp; or you need to eat something with potassium&nbsp; in it. That this is your body remembering&nbsp;&nbsp; something and trying to share it with you,&nbsp; you know. And that's amazing that you were&nbsp;&nbsp; able to capture that because I'm sure it can&nbsp; be sort of hard in those moments too to kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of grab a camera or something and record it&nbsp; as it's happening if it's fleeting. Yeah. So this is uh called palm planter pular psoriasis&nbsp; and I developed this in 2018. Uh when I uh began&nbsp;&nbsp; to defy my programming and the cult in my pursuit&nbsp; of truth through the word of yah. Uh there's&nbsp;&nbsp; all kinds of programming implemented to inflict&nbsp; the body. Um it's done very physically but also&nbsp;&nbsp; uh through um spirits that come in um and parts&nbsp; that are activated that have the spiritual power&nbsp;&nbsp; from these demons in order to inflict this kind&nbsp; of horror. And so I developed this psoriasis&nbsp;&nbsp; um on my hand, my arms, mostly my legs, and the&nbsp; bottoms of my feet, which was the worst because&nbsp;&nbsp; it really impaired my ability to walk when it&nbsp; was really bad. Um and so that's what this is.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then um I think hopefully it's the next&nbsp; video you'll see a miracle of healing. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp; of course I had to show off my garden. Um because&nbsp; there's just hope. There's just so much hope in&nbsp;&nbsp; the garden. A scripture starts and ends in the&nbsp; garden. Um and you'll see there is no psoriasis&nbsp;&nbsp; whatsoever. It completely heed healed up through&nbsp; the laying on of hands when I was rescued to a&nbsp;&nbsp; place of refuge. Um a after I escaped the cult and&nbsp; I talk talked about that in the last interview.&nbsp;&nbsp; uh my psoriasis disappeared. Um and so that was&nbsp; just an absolute miracle um that was administered&nbsp;&nbsp; through the body of of Christ through the laying&nbsp; on of hands. And when your body is in a safe&nbsp;&nbsp; place and it starts to decompress and trauma can&nbsp; start to come out and come forth, sometimes you'll&nbsp;&nbsp; go through what's known as a healing crisis and&nbsp; things might kind of flare up and get worse before&nbsp;&nbsp; they get better. It's it's like a detox, right?&nbsp; And so, uh, that was a total miracle just to watch&nbsp;&nbsp; that basically evaporate before our eyes, um, in&nbsp; the weeks following that laying on of hands and&nbsp;&nbsp; that prayer and that just oh, the the horror of&nbsp; realizing everything that had gone on and that is&nbsp;&nbsp; still going on, but yet the safety of knowing that&nbsp; I'm in a place of refuge and that this now can be&nbsp;&nbsp; a season of healing. Um and uh yeah, you know, the&nbsp; seeing just seeing the garden the garden there,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, I think a lot of survivors and I&nbsp; encourage this um have found a lot of therapy a&nbsp;&nbsp; therapeutic benefits um in keeping and maintaining&nbsp; a garden. And so I had the opportunity to start a&nbsp;&nbsp; start a garden from from scratch from a patch of&nbsp; dirt and just sew in hope as just a a prayer and a&nbsp;&nbsp; prophecy of just the harvest that comes forth. um&nbsp; when we are faithful and we walk in truth and and&nbsp;&nbsp; when we do the right thing um the the labor of our&nbsp; hands and the labor of our hearts will not return&nbsp;&nbsp; void. It really will not. And so this is just an&nbsp; encouragement um for anyone out there. Oh my gosh,&nbsp;&nbsp; I love the garden and I love seeing your healed&nbsp; skin, you know, and and the way that God worked&nbsp;&nbsp; miracles on you and you and yourself or having&nbsp; the courage to pursue healing, you know, and to&nbsp;&nbsp; not just sort of slap on a diagnosis on yourself&nbsp; and treat it with, you know, western medicine, but&nbsp;&nbsp; actually do the inner work to identify what the&nbsp; root cause of it was. Would you have any advice&nbsp;&nbsp; for survivors who may be in different levels of&nbsp; healing and memory recall but might be questioning&nbsp;&nbsp; if something that they're experiencing healthwise&nbsp; is a memory or if it's something that they&nbsp;&nbsp; actually need to go get help for? Do you have any&nbsp; tips on how they might be able to tap into that&nbsp;&nbsp; and and see? You mentioned a safe environment. I&nbsp; feel like that's a really good a good tip. Do you&nbsp;&nbsp; have any other ways that could maybe be helpful?&nbsp; Recognizing patterns of when symptoms are flaring&nbsp;&nbsp; up and trying to pay attention and documenting&nbsp; those can help. Um, for example, I noticed a&nbsp;&nbsp; an alleviation of very specific symptoms when I&nbsp; was not around certain people. And as I began to&nbsp;&nbsp; go through uh as parts in my my system um which&nbsp; I sometimes call a bus and sometimes call Ktown&nbsp;&nbsp; that was affect affectionately named um um by&nbsp; someone I love very dearly. Um um when when&nbsp;&nbsp; members of Ktown began to come forward and and&nbsp; make confessions, it it became evident that a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of these symptoms were attached to specific&nbsp; being around specific abusers. And because those&nbsp;&nbsp; amnesic barriers were high, I just thought I had&nbsp; had a bunch of mysterious illnesses or whatever,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, Lyme disease, bartinella, mcass, uh&nbsp; histamine. Um, histamine uh is a real big trend&nbsp;&nbsp; right now. Histamine intoleranced or mass cell&nbsp; activation syndrome. Histamine is actually used&nbsp;&nbsp; and studied in programming and you can research&nbsp; this very easily on the n you know NIH website.&nbsp;&nbsp; um histamine and memory are very closely connected&nbsp; and so it's been very widely studied um how uh&nbsp;&nbsp; blocking uh and interfering with certain histamine&nbsp; receptors actually um inhibits or increases memory&nbsp;&nbsp; recall facial recognition um and different&nbsp; things like that and so um I I don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp; stand here and say everything um is is related&nbsp; to programming and everything is related to to&nbsp;&nbsp; trauma, but it is my belief that the majority&nbsp; of illnesses and symptoms that are out there are&nbsp;&nbsp; rooted spiritually are rooted in trauma. And so I&nbsp; think that you can't go wrong in at least praying&nbsp;&nbsp; about it and exploring that as a possibility. Um&nbsp; and um and just through prayer. A lot of this for&nbsp;&nbsp; me had to be had to I came into awareness just&nbsp; from from the counsel um that comes from the one&nbsp;&nbsp; who can see where I cannot where doctors cannot&nbsp; you know he has you know yeah one of our songs&nbsp;&nbsp; um that we posted um entitled the quickening um&nbsp; goes you know is a petition and a prayer to the&nbsp;&nbsp; seven spirits of God uh the seven spirits of&nbsp; Yahw which are spirits, the spirit of counsel,&nbsp;&nbsp; wisdom, understanding, uh, knowledge, might, his&nbsp; spirit, and then also the fear of Yahw. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp; we need really his counsel. And so, I would just&nbsp; say just pray, go to him and ask. Repentance for&nbsp;&nbsp; me has been a also a part of healing, harboring&nbsp; unforgiveness. Um there's actually secular&nbsp;&nbsp; studies done um a lot of secular studies done&nbsp; that talk about how um unforgiveness increases&nbsp;&nbsp; um your probability of getting cancer. Um and&nbsp; that's because a lot of people have unforgiveness&nbsp;&nbsp; also as a result of trauma. And so it's just kind&nbsp; of a complicated web and we really we really need&nbsp;&nbsp; the wisdom that comes from heaven in order to&nbsp; be able to walk through it because it's really&nbsp;&nbsp; overwhelming. I found navigating I have found&nbsp; navigating illness really really overwhelming.&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you eat? What do you not eat? How do you&nbsp; heal? What is this attributed to? And so without&nbsp;&nbsp; w without praying, I wouldn't know. And some&nbsp; things are still a bit mysterious to me. And&nbsp;&nbsp; so just learning to tr to seek understanding from&nbsp; him but then also trust where I don't understand&nbsp;&nbsp; yet. Um you know has been a process that I'm still&nbsp; navigating. Um yeah so I don't know if that that's&nbsp;&nbsp; too helpful but it's very helpful. And sort of&nbsp; along those same lines, um the last question that&nbsp;&nbsp; I have today that I wanted to ask just about this&nbsp; particular topic of sort of the healing stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp; um ab reactions are one way that our bodies can&nbsp; sort of start harming itself in a way through&nbsp;&nbsp; the energy and through the trauma. Um that's not&nbsp; brought on by the actual survivor doing anything&nbsp;&nbsp; to their body to to um you know actually putting&nbsp; a needle in themselves or anything. This is sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of a a really supernatural process that happens&nbsp; through memory. But there's also the self harm&nbsp;&nbsp; programming that can activate as somebody's&nbsp; remembering. And a lot of survivors are like&nbsp;&nbsp; you when they wake up where they don't know what&nbsp; did. They've never heard of mind control. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; they're trying to do the right thing by getting&nbsp; help and disclosing. And programming is triggering&nbsp;&nbsp; them to do the opposite. you know, instead of&nbsp; healing, it's it's it's trying to get them to&nbsp;&nbsp; harm themselves um in different ways. And I wanted&nbsp; to see how you dealt with that when and if it&nbsp;&nbsp; happened to you. And of course, any any guidance&nbsp; you could give people listening who may or may not&nbsp;&nbsp; be experiencing that. um you know, how to maybe&nbsp; navigate that if somebody does remember or you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, if somebody's in the process of remembering&nbsp; and sort of how to uh how to navigate that. Wow, that is that's a deep that's a really deep&nbsp; one that and that was something that I really&nbsp;&nbsp; struggled with um even recently um with the&nbsp; urge to there because there are parts right&nbsp;&nbsp; with with the urge to self harm and I would say&nbsp; that underneath the surface of that is a deep&nbsp;&nbsp; deep self-hatred and a deep deep self-loathing&nbsp; and a perpetuation of the abuse abuse onto self&nbsp;&nbsp; because there were parts that were that I that&nbsp; were in in my system um are even are in my system&nbsp;&nbsp; that are introjections of particular handlers or&nbsp; particular programmers or abusers that are meant&nbsp;&nbsp; to inflict harm as a punishment or a consequence&nbsp; for violating the program or for for disob&nbsp;&nbsp; um disob disobedience. And so what those&nbsp; what what really needs to happen there is&nbsp;&nbsp; for those parts to come out of hiding and into&nbsp; the light of of of their worth and their value&nbsp;&nbsp; um and to to basically receive just the ministry&nbsp; of love. I believe the ministry of love and the&nbsp;&nbsp; ministry of acceptance. Um, I'm not sure that&nbsp; those behaviors can go away though until there&nbsp;&nbsp; are parts that come forward to confess the&nbsp; reasons why they hate themselves so much.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe it's something that they have done in&nbsp; the cult that they were forced to do. They&nbsp;&nbsp; don't understand perhaps how they were programmed&nbsp; because a lot of them um have been told that they&nbsp;&nbsp; are bad or that they are evil and did not know&nbsp; that they weren't doing things out of their own&nbsp;&nbsp; free will but they were doing things as they&nbsp; were programmed to do. Um and so I I I tend&nbsp;&nbsp; to look at self harm almost always. Um I used to&nbsp; think it was like a like de like a just demons.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and um, and you know, it's it's not I&nbsp; think it's more complicated. There's often&nbsp;&nbsp; pain and trauma from other parts that have been&nbsp; fragmented, whether through ritual abuse or not,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, that are um, screaming out for help and&nbsp; there's no other way for them to express the&nbsp;&nbsp; pain. I have a silent scream that is very&nbsp; closely connected to a self harm program.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that silent scream is very common amongst&nbsp; survivors who were not able to ask for help or&nbsp;&nbsp; when they did they were punished for it. And so um&nbsp; giving these parts any form of expression even if&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't have someone who is trusted who these&nbsp; parts can come forward and emote to or interact&nbsp;&nbsp; with or receive ministry or prayer or just love&nbsp; and affection from. Um, you can get a sketchbook,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can pick up a notepad, you can begin to write,&nbsp; and you can begin to just speak into yourself and&nbsp;&nbsp; say, \"Is there any part broken part of me that is&nbsp; in pain that that would like to talk, would like&nbsp;&nbsp; to talk about what happened, would like to show&nbsp; me or just give me a word.\" And you can draw,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can write poetry, and you can just try to&nbsp; see what comes up and allow these parts to come&nbsp;&nbsp; forward and to receive them in love and to receive&nbsp; them in appreciation and to to start to understand&nbsp;&nbsp; the things that are keeping them bound that&nbsp; are keeping that part of our soul bound so that&nbsp;&nbsp; they can receive freedom. Thank you so much for&nbsp; that. That's to me has been weighing on my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp; You see the desperation and the will of people&nbsp; wanting to get free and then unfortunately in&nbsp;&nbsp; our community, those same some of those same&nbsp; people who make it past actually getting out,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is such a huge step end up falling to the&nbsp; pitfalls of self harm, you know, and and it's&nbsp;&nbsp; just so incredibly sad. And I feel like if people&nbsp; are just aware of this, we can help support our&nbsp;&nbsp; friends and and family and people in our lives&nbsp; that end up remembering um things that they&nbsp;&nbsp; went through. And then also that survivors can or&nbsp; people that think that they might be survivors can&nbsp;&nbsp; be educated enough for when those times come if if&nbsp; they think that they're a survivor or think that&nbsp;&nbsp; they might have memory coming up, you know, that&nbsp; they're also equipped with understanding what what&nbsp;&nbsp; might happen, you know, the good, the bad, the&nbsp; ugly, um, and sort of how to navigate that. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; I really really appreciate your perspective&nbsp; on that. And it's, you know, what a miracle&nbsp;&nbsp; that you've been over, you've been able to&nbsp; overcome that so many times in your own journey. I'll I'll tell you a little story. I had a I thank&nbsp; you. I I appreciate that. And and and I couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; do it alone. Um I I um have I I'll say have I'm&nbsp; not integrated. Um, and so one of one of my parts,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, so the selfharming part that I have dealt with&nbsp; is is not really much of a cutter, but more of a&nbsp;&nbsp; b like a would I would uh beat my head with my&nbsp; fists to try to get uh, you know, something would&nbsp;&nbsp; trigger it. Something would trigger this part that&nbsp; would cause like head bashing. Um, and you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's it can be a confusing experience, uh, trying&nbsp; to figure out what triggers it. Um, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of I was in so much distress and torment I&nbsp; couldn't make my brain turn off on this loop or&nbsp;&nbsp; something happened um that created a sense of fear&nbsp; or self-hatred, whatever it was. This is what this&nbsp;&nbsp; part did. Um and I um had been praying and asking&nbsp; for help regarding this um and um this this friend&nbsp;&nbsp; of mine who um I've been living with um who by the&nbsp; spirit brought the clothes that I had prayed for.&nbsp;&nbsp; um this part came forward um in front of&nbsp; her and this part had never done that before&nbsp;&nbsp; um in front of anybody that was not a handler&nbsp; or an abuser. And um it was interesting because&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm internally talking to this part that now has&nbsp; full almost full control of the body. I'm now cast&nbsp;&nbsp; to the back me as Kadiah. And um this part um who&nbsp; goes by the name of Zineia um I'm now speaking I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; now at the back and she's in the driver's seat and&nbsp; she's starting to you know hit her fists against&nbsp;&nbsp; her head and I'm speaking into her system into&nbsp; the system telling her that that the thing that&nbsp;&nbsp; triggered it um was not a big deal and it was&nbsp; a small thing I thought and I'm trying to tell&nbsp;&nbsp; her to de to to deescalate that it's okay it's&nbsp; not a big deal and the fact that this happened&nbsp;&nbsp; in front of this friend who I had f you know grown&nbsp; in to love and trust was it was a miracle and she&nbsp;&nbsp; came over to me and she held my hands down and&nbsp; restrained my fists from inflicting any further&nbsp;&nbsp; self harm and she said the opposite of what I&nbsp; was saying she said it That's a big deal and I&nbsp;&nbsp; want to hear why. And this part was able to tell&nbsp; her, okay, this is this is the reason why this&nbsp;&nbsp; was a trigger. I had lost my phone. When we don't&nbsp; have our phone, we are not safe. We cannot call&nbsp;&nbsp; for help. We cannot uh we cannot this, we cannot&nbsp; that. We have to have the phone nearby because if&nbsp;&nbsp; a programmer or a master or a handler calls with&nbsp; a code or instruction and we don't have our phone&nbsp;&nbsp; with us, we get tormented, we get electrocuted,&nbsp; we get strangled, uh we get our head shoved into&nbsp;&nbsp; the toilet or we are punished or you know put into&nbsp; solitary confinement. I didn't know this. I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; know this. I thought I just had these triggers&nbsp; that were stupid and ridiculous and didn't make&nbsp;&nbsp; any sense. Um, and so just through prayer um, and&nbsp; the orchestration of the Holy Spirit, this friend&nbsp;&nbsp; uh, that I was with, this event triggered it. She&nbsp; came forward. She was actually able to speak with&nbsp;&nbsp; this friend and receive healing and understand&nbsp; that she's not where she was. She has been&nbsp;&nbsp; rescued. She's safe now. Nobody has her phone. No&nbsp; programs or handlers even have her phone number&nbsp;&nbsp; anymore. She's not uh she's not she doesn't need&nbsp; to be accessible to them and she doesn't need to&nbsp;&nbsp; feel like she has to have her phone ready in a&nbsp; state of emergency in case something happens all&nbsp;&nbsp; the time. It's not a big deal anymore. Um but I&nbsp; wasn't able to do that process with her. I was&nbsp;&nbsp; handling it wrong. So, I was not counseling this&nbsp; part very well. I was just kind of annoyed with&nbsp;&nbsp; myself and that was just making it worse. That&nbsp; was just making it worse and increasing the self&nbsp;&nbsp; harm behavior, increasing the self-loathing&nbsp; because I didn't have understanding. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; there's just an example of a way that somebody you&nbsp; know full of wisdom full of education about did&nbsp;&nbsp; education about mind control programming education&nbsp; about all of this can help to minister to these&nbsp;&nbsp; parts and if anyone's looking for a secular&nbsp; resource I highly recommend Allison Miller&nbsp;&nbsp; um she has just such a great lay of the land uh&nbsp; such a great workbook that you can work through um&nbsp;&nbsp; on your own um even um called becoming yourself.&nbsp; And I've just found it so incredibly helpful. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; and those who have been learning to support me&nbsp; have as well and she has a YouTube channel. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp; you. We love resources on here. Obviously, of&nbsp; course, our favorite resources come directly from&nbsp;&nbsp; you guys on here um who are creating resources&nbsp; for us. But it's really great to hear, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; what helps you in your journey and the other&nbsp; people, whether it's somebody that you had person&nbsp;&nbsp; in your life, like this woman that you're talking&nbsp; that you talked about who helped you navigate that&nbsp;&nbsp; self harm programming or people who have have&nbsp; existed in in a book that you read, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; or an author or um whatever it is that that helped&nbsp; you along your journey. It's really good to have&nbsp;&nbsp; those available for survivors to sort of create&nbsp; their own toolbox of of references that they can&nbsp;&nbsp; go have. So, I appreciate you sharing that story.&nbsp; You want to bring should we talk about some of the&nbsp;&nbsp; locations since we have stories of that? Let's get&nbsp; let's, you know, let's let's just do that. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp; just get through the photo album and then anything&nbsp; left over we could always meet a different time. So, this is uh interesting. I wanted to mention&nbsp; um if you might tell by the change in my voice,&nbsp;&nbsp; this photo has brought out a a different part&nbsp; in my system to explain. Um so this is the queen&nbsp;&nbsp; um in Massie Tunnel and Massie Tunnel was one&nbsp; of the centers where I was programmed. Uh it&nbsp;&nbsp; is a center for the seed a seed of Satan&nbsp; project pertaining to the beast system.&nbsp;&nbsp; um and the conception of uh crisper technology&nbsp; through various uh rituals. Um and so um one of&nbsp;&nbsp; the things that takes place in this particular&nbsp; area and British Columbia at large, hence its&nbsp;&nbsp; name, British Columbia, we all know uh the the the&nbsp; movie logo Colombia has the Luciferian, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's Lucifer um at the beginning of of those movie&nbsp; movies Colombia Pictures. So, seed of Satan or&nbsp;&nbsp; seed of Lucifer, there's a lot of reptilian hybrid&nbsp; technology pertaining to frogs or dragons, royal&nbsp;&nbsp; bloodline families, uh monsters, hybrids. These&nbsp; are the things that you read about in scripture&nbsp;&nbsp; um that happened in the days of Noah. And of&nbsp; course, it says as it was in the days of Noah&nbsp;&nbsp; in Matthew 24, so it will be in the last days.&nbsp; And so Jude, the book of Jude goes through this&nbsp;&nbsp; uh these types of um um projects, these types,&nbsp; this type of um this these bloodline kingdoms,&nbsp;&nbsp; these hybridizations, this lust for strange flesh.&nbsp; And so ma the queen came uh to open Massie Tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'm sorry. The Queen of England's not coming&nbsp; to open Massie Tunnel. Who cares about a tunnel&nbsp;&nbsp; tunnel by the stinky Fraser River in in British&nbsp; Columbia? So the the Massie tunnel is where there&nbsp;&nbsp; was a lot of electroshock that I went through as&nbsp; well as preparation and uh conception as a remote&nbsp;&nbsp; womb um for uh Nephilim uh Raphaim and uh various&nbsp; um horrific and monstrous gestations, many of&nbsp;&nbsp; which Yah has mercifully protected me from having&nbsp; to remember fully in order to receive healing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um uh you know you might have heard Nathan I think&nbsp; you you know you have had Nathan Reynolds on um he&nbsp;&nbsp; talks about his his family's bloodline pertaining&nbsp; to the dragon and so this is a location where&nbsp;&nbsp; those similar types of things happen. Yeah. Wow.&nbsp; and and so the Massie Tunnel um and not far from&nbsp;&nbsp; the Massie Tunnel is a paper mill where some of my&nbsp; programming also took place. And so you see people&nbsp;&nbsp; walking through it. Where um where exactly is it?&nbsp; Is there anything you can mention that it's around&nbsp;&nbsp; to give people reference if they were going&nbsp; to go look it up or aren't familiar with it?&nbsp;&nbsp; So it's along the Fraser River in British&nbsp; Columbia which is not far from the American border&nbsp;&nbsp; um in Delta and so uh Delta was also part of&nbsp; my programming uh assassin programming um so&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been through beta programming and Delta&nbsp; programming um as well as pro uh programming for&nbsp;&nbsp; um well I guess the related to the&nbsp; delta programming was was for espionage&nbsp;&nbsp; for the military, doing special reconnaissance,&nbsp; um you know, doing certain missions. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; Delta though is a huge the city of Delta, there's&nbsp; North Delta and South Delta, they're both used for&nbsp;&nbsp; um the the creation of Delta assassins. And so&nbsp; these parts were you were created in this tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are corridors. There are many doors in this&nbsp; tunnel. you can see if you drive through it, but&nbsp;&nbsp; you can take a corridor and it will, you know, you&nbsp; know, they know, you know, there's there's there's&nbsp;&nbsp; corridors inside corridors and rooms within rooms&nbsp; within rooms in this place. And so that's where&nbsp;&nbsp; this technology was. Um where I went through some&nbsp; some rituals, some uh some pregnancies um and some&nbsp;&nbsp; you know they don't bring these things often out&nbsp; into full gestation because they really just need&nbsp;&nbsp; to conceive life. Life life seems like a the wrong&nbsp; term. conceive death in your womb in order to be&nbsp;&nbsp; able to feed these things to the dragon that&nbsp; we read about in the book of Revelation that is&nbsp;&nbsp; making war against the seed of of man, the seed&nbsp; of or the seed of Yahw. And you know, it's just&nbsp;&nbsp; so ironic how something so sinister that is used&nbsp; for something so sinister, how they invert it to&nbsp;&nbsp; the public and make it seem like this celebratory&nbsp; moment that is worthy of paparazzi and the queen&nbsp;&nbsp; coming out dressed up, you know, fully garbed&nbsp; up with her makeup and her outfit and high heels&nbsp;&nbsp; and a purse and, you know, it's just so backwards&nbsp; whenever you whenever you think about it. Anytime&nbsp;&nbsp; that I see like events like this with different&nbsp; monuments, now my my brain is always like, what&nbsp;&nbsp; is happening there? If they're celebrating it like&nbsp; this, this has to be something that's not worth&nbsp;&nbsp; celebrating. If that's what they're doing, you&nbsp; know? So, it's really it's pretty neat that you&nbsp;&nbsp; were able to get validation through this through&nbsp; finding this documentation and these photographs&nbsp;&nbsp; that can prove this this location and that show&nbsp; it being publicly, you know, fanaticized over and,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, paparazzi worthy, you know, but also&nbsp; hearing from your side of the story what what&nbsp;&nbsp; these tunnels were actually used for. How many&nbsp; children do you remember being down there with&nbsp;&nbsp; you at any given time? I don't remember anyone&nbsp; except for myself, my programmer, and another&nbsp;&nbsp; man. Oh my gosh. And um I was taken actually to&nbsp; meet the queen um at her uh during her golden&nbsp;&nbsp; jubilee tour in 2002 October in Victoria um at the&nbsp; Parliament building by the Empress uh hotel which&nbsp;&nbsp; is owned by a family who owns something called&nbsp; Monarch Schools. um they're also in San Diego and&nbsp;&nbsp; of course most I think of your viewers know what&nbsp; monarch programming is and so I was a you know a&nbsp;&nbsp; monarch slave. So I was taken to meet the queen&nbsp; at this um at this this you know jubilee event&nbsp;&nbsp; in Victoria um by the Empress Hotel um with this&nbsp; friend of mine by my programmer. Um I I I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; have a full recollection of the day. Um I remember&nbsp; being exorbitantly thirsty while I was waiting to&nbsp;&nbsp; meet her. I had been um prepped on how to properly&nbsp; greet her. Um, and I was and so I had, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; when I h when I have these memories of excessive&nbsp; thirsts, I know that usually scapolopene or some&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of other drug that creates both compliance&nbsp; submission and then also amnesia was used. Um, and&nbsp;&nbsp; so the monarch programming, the queen, um, uh, the&nbsp; serpent seed, and this is all biblical, um, this&nbsp;&nbsp; was all a part of my programming. Victoria, BC&nbsp; was huge. This area was huge. Lower mainland. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; Crown Packaging in Richmond, BC was one location&nbsp; where I was programmed at night. This came forth&nbsp;&nbsp; through a personality uh who uh oh speaks German.&nbsp; I didn't know I spoke German. Um until this part&nbsp;&nbsp; came forward to talk about the paper mill to talk&nbsp; about uh what happened there to her at night. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; and crowned crown of course crown packaging again&nbsp; it's related. All of their codes are really quite&nbsp;&nbsp; out in the open. But the Golmet family, who's a&nbsp; family of German Jewish descent from Frankfurt,&nbsp;&nbsp; um is known for their success in banking and&nbsp; finance. Um and so they have a code of arms of&nbsp;&nbsp; barren with with a with it's um there's they're&nbsp; closely related to the Roth Rothschild. Um so you&nbsp;&nbsp; can if you're interested, you can look up James&nbsp; Goldmid and his relationship with the Rothschild.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so they're like a royal bloodline family going&nbsp; back to, you know, German royalty um and um some&nbsp;&nbsp; of the richest families of of Monaco. And um so&nbsp; they they use a lot of these mills um and they're&nbsp;&nbsp; ideal, right? Because it's really easy with&nbsp; access to chemicals to dispose of bodies. It runs&nbsp;&nbsp; through the night. It's usually an industrial&nbsp; area with not a lot of people around. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; noisy and so I went through a lot of torture and&nbsp; behavioral conditioning at that location as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Absolutely horrifying. I'm so sorry and I'm really&nbsp; grateful that you're shining a light on this so we&nbsp;&nbsp; can look at these photos and this location in a&nbsp; different light, you know, and and realize that&nbsp;&nbsp; if it happened to you when it did that there's&nbsp; still likely this type of abuse happening under&nbsp;&nbsp; there to children, you know, and if people are&nbsp; around that area, please pray over it. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; help share about it. Um share these photos and&nbsp; Kadia's story. Um, it's just really, it's sad how&nbsp;&nbsp; many different locations, especially underground,&nbsp; are used for these types of abuses. Um, so I'll&nbsp;&nbsp; scroll to the next photo. That's just one of many&nbsp; examples of some of the children's books that are&nbsp;&nbsp; written by Freemasons, uh, who are a part of this&nbsp; agenda to usher in the antichrist, to further the&nbsp;&nbsp; seed of Satan and their agenda. Robert Munch was&nbsp; used, Dr. Seuss was used, Harg Graves was used,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I just wanted to show this one um because this&nbsp; paper bag princess, you know, we have the dragon,&nbsp;&nbsp; we have um princess programming um that is done&nbsp; in the monarch program, you know, because those&nbsp;&nbsp; there are a lot of often um that's that's the&nbsp; whole purpose of Disney, right? the whole Disney&nbsp;&nbsp; princess is to to come under to come under the&nbsp; monarch parts that come under the jurisdiction of&nbsp;&nbsp; the monarch and even or the monarchy and even you&nbsp; know um Disney Disneyland or is it Disney World?&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh it's pro it may be both like but it might be&nbsp; one or the other is is own is actually under the&nbsp;&nbsp; jurisdiction of the crown. So they have their&nbsp; own sort of legal system and it's not actually&nbsp;&nbsp; uh Dominion of the United States. So So these&nbsp; books are used in programming to create parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a character in here that goes by the name&nbsp; Prince. like I have I have parts in my my bus&nbsp;&nbsp; um in K Town that go by these characters names&nbsp; uh because this was such a huge part of my head&nbsp;&nbsp; programmer's um formula in fracturing me through&nbsp; these processes of torture creating both of both&nbsp;&nbsp; these princess parts from books like this or&nbsp; stories uh Disney that do not have uh that have&nbsp;&nbsp; a very narrow uh scope of reality. um that so many&nbsp; of us healing from systematized abuse through mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control programming um are needing to bring&nbsp; into the surface and into the present to know&nbsp;&nbsp; that we're not under we're not under order anymore&nbsp; and we don't have to activate these programs that&nbsp;&nbsp; are causing illness or distress in the body or&nbsp; blocking memories and things. The last episode&nbsp;&nbsp; when you brought up Dr. Seuss that made like a&nbsp; huge splash with people and people are like no not&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. I love them as you know, but a lot of these&nbsp; these things that they popular popularize for&nbsp;&nbsp; children, Disney, you know, hard greaves, like&nbsp; you said, um books by Robert Munch, all these&nbsp;&nbsp; different um sort of things that they give our&nbsp; kids to to cling on to. It's just disgusting, you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, the meaning, the actual meanings behind it&nbsp; when you actually like really look at what is what&nbsp;&nbsp; the message is of of these different stories that&nbsp; they tell and then realizing the nefarious ways&nbsp;&nbsp; that they're used on children behind the scenes&nbsp; who go through these mind control programs. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; I I do appreciate you sharing that cuz there's a&nbsp; lot of parents that listen to these um channels&nbsp;&nbsp; and and interviews and want to be safer for&nbsp; their kids. And this is one way that they sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; sneak sneak programming and messages that can be&nbsp; actually really damaging to children into parents'&nbsp;&nbsp; hands because they get popularized as being really&nbsp; good and wholesome, you know. And so it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp; just good to know kind of the truth about some&nbsp; of these things and it's like who would ever who&nbsp;&nbsp; would ever guess so many of us grew up on all of&nbsp; these different stories and books and authors and&nbsp;&nbsp; you know thinking about them being Freemasons puts&nbsp; it in a different light and then also realizing&nbsp;&nbsp; that we shouldn't be supporting this because&nbsp; these are these are still likely being used today&nbsp;&nbsp; on children you know as programming scripts.&nbsp; Yeah. Yeah. And these parts often, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; they stay children, right, until they come to that&nbsp; place of healing and we can we can work with them,&nbsp;&nbsp; counsel them, minister them, get that trauma&nbsp; healing so then they can grow up and be the age of&nbsp;&nbsp; the body and then if it's ideal integrate. So they&nbsp; stay children and so they they have a lot they've&nbsp;&nbsp; believed lies, right? All of the programming is&nbsp; done. It's undone under torture, but there's a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of deception and a lot of theatrics that are&nbsp; done. There's a lot of staging and there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of theater um which I know most of us are aware&nbsp; of um excuse me I had I have a part um who was uh&nbsp;&nbsp; programmed um on the island of St. Thomas or the&nbsp; island of St. Thomas in the in the Virgin Islands,&nbsp;&nbsp; there was this big ship. There was an island. It's&nbsp; this like it's this whole staged shipwrecked thing&nbsp;&nbsp; and these Freemasons come and they they basically&nbsp; they strand you. They stay they they strand you.&nbsp;&nbsp; They they starve you and then they send this like&nbsp; theater on a pirate ship over full of all of these&nbsp;&nbsp; Freemasons acting like it's, you know, the Lord of&nbsp; the Flies. And they come and they will I will you&nbsp;&nbsp; know abuse the the damsel in distress or the child&nbsp; or the young woman who is being programmed who has&nbsp;&nbsp; been left on the island as a part of fulfilling&nbsp; their sick their sick fantasies but to also create&nbsp;&nbsp; um to also create further trauma uh for for parts&nbsp; like it's like Hollywood all of these stories you&nbsp;&nbsp; know Pirates of the Caribbean in it's all for&nbsp; these kinds of these kinds of programmings. My&nbsp;&nbsp; my part that had a severe eating disorder um and&nbsp; parts with eating disorders and then parts that&nbsp;&nbsp; would overeat. I it was a mystery for the longest&nbsp; time until these parts began to come forward and&nbsp;&nbsp; explain what had happened to them. These dynamics&nbsp; were created through um starvation um on in these&nbsp;&nbsp; shipwreck programs. Oh my goodness, that's&nbsp; horrifying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was a big&nbsp;&nbsp; key in that really broke something off me though.&nbsp; um when those memories came back, it explained so&nbsp;&nbsp; much and I you know and I've been able to verify&nbsp; and validate everything through research um dates,&nbsp;&nbsp; times, locations, getting that validation. I've&nbsp; heard that from so many different people who have&nbsp;&nbsp; come on the show and testified that they didn't&nbsp; most of their memories they had never heard of&nbsp;&nbsp; these locations or they had no memory of like&nbsp; reading these specific books or you know seeing&nbsp;&nbsp; these films or whatever it was and then they&nbsp; go look it up online and see that it's actually&nbsp;&nbsp; real like how you did you know looking up these&nbsp; locations that you remember this underground place&nbsp;&nbsp; these books these authors um and then being able&nbsp; to match them with with parts inside you you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; in different systems that that are are within&nbsp; you to be able to identify, oh, that's where&nbsp;&nbsp; this came from and that's what that name is from&nbsp; or that's where this this part is from and why it&nbsp;&nbsp; thinks the way that it does, you know. So, it&nbsp; is so validating and hopefully can help people&nbsp;&nbsp; on the other side of the screen too. Yeah, this&nbsp; is yeah, that's just a picture of the Empress uh&nbsp;&nbsp; the Empress Hotel um that I had mentioned um where&nbsp; I had stayed where some of the programming takes&nbsp;&nbsp; place for Monarch programming and it's owned&nbsp; by um that couple uh who owns Monarch schools.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh my gosh, it's actually really and it's known&nbsp; as being one of It's stunningly gorgeous. It's a&nbsp;&nbsp; famous hotel. It's known for being super haunted.&nbsp; Uh I was taken there. Uh I was taken there and uh&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah it was bad. A lot of there was a lot of like&nbsp; um there's a lot of uh electroshock torture that&nbsp;&nbsp; happened um in the like under the harbor under the&nbsp; Victoria Harbor where this hotel is. There are a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of military submarines that are under there.&nbsp; Um they're easy to research. That's an example of&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the things I was able to verify like down&nbsp; to the model of the submarine that I remember&nbsp;&nbsp; um which was actually just retired recently. The&nbsp; actual model of submarine has now been retired for&nbsp;&nbsp; a new and updated version. But there's a lot&nbsp; of programming, a lot of ritual abuse, a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of torture that happened um in the Victoria Harbor&nbsp; underwater. How horrifying. again like places that&nbsp;&nbsp; people I'm sure this hotel is like for example is&nbsp; somewhere that's like on people's destination list&nbsp;&nbsp; that they are just like so excited to go stay at&nbsp; or go tour just drive by you know and again it's&nbsp;&nbsp; just horrible how they invert you know some of the&nbsp; most beautiful things on the planet whether it's&nbsp;&nbsp; uh an actual location in nature or an something&nbsp; built some type of architecture um and how how&nbsp;&nbsp; much they do damage to it, you know, or&nbsp; the Vatican like what you've talked about,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, it really it kind of like you can&nbsp; look at it initially without knowing and and&nbsp;&nbsp; be wowed and awed by it, but then like this dark&nbsp; cloud comes over it that you can't really unsee,&nbsp;&nbsp; which I sort of experienced just looking at this&nbsp; initially whenever I looked at this hotel. I was&nbsp;&nbsp; like, \"Wow, it's beautiful.\" But it's like you&nbsp; see the dark cloud within it as well. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of you almost see um you almost can like see&nbsp; and feel the evil that is within, you know. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's really sad that they do that. It's the other&nbsp; There's a hotel across the harbor to the U Ocean&nbsp;&nbsp; Point Resort. It's a Sherin uh Sherin's uh the&nbsp; Sherin hotel chain uh is also used uh as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's also part of the beast system seed of Satan&nbsp; project where people will come um it's the to&nbsp;&nbsp; that that the whole infrastructure is completely&nbsp; set up for programming for triggers. People are&nbsp;&nbsp; hired that are programmed very specifically. Um&nbsp; it's it's quite a seamless it's quite a seamless&nbsp;&nbsp; thing. But yeah, Sherin Hotels, including that&nbsp; one, that was part of my my experience. Wow.&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the things that they did was they uh um in&nbsp; the electroshock torture in this specific location&nbsp;&nbsp; um that is the worst ab reaction that I experience&nbsp; is in my teeth. It's like it's wor it's a it's&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a pain worse than pain. It's like to have&nbsp; your teeth be electrocuted. But a a metal ball,&nbsp;&nbsp; electrode ball was placed in my mouth as I&nbsp; was being brutalized and tortured so that&nbsp;&nbsp; if I screamed or made any noise, that ball would&nbsp; activate and it would worsen the pain and it would&nbsp;&nbsp; actually because just there's something about the&nbsp; teeth. It's just oh my gosh, a demented hell of a&nbsp;&nbsp; pain beyond hell. Um and so sometimes I still&nbsp; experience that. um sensation and it's I just&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't even have words. Um but that's part of&nbsp; the silencing program where they teach you to&nbsp;&nbsp; endure symptoms, to endure pain, to endure torture&nbsp; because when you scream or make a noise, that ball&nbsp;&nbsp; in your mouth will activate and shock your teeth.&nbsp; So it's worse if you scream or cry. So you have&nbsp;&nbsp; to endure, you learn to endure it silently. And&nbsp; so that is one of the ways that a silent scream&nbsp;&nbsp; um might be created. And that silent scream, you&nbsp; know, it it needs to come out in order for that to&nbsp;&nbsp; heal. And it's really hard because the brain will&nbsp; rewire its neural circuitry, its neurons together&nbsp;&nbsp; to actually create to actually make it impossible&nbsp; to scream or to make noise because you're when&nbsp;&nbsp; you're in that situation, those neurons wire&nbsp; together. So pain equals silence, torture equals&nbsp;&nbsp; silence. And it becomes biologically hardwired. So&nbsp; there are so many people, Emma, that are walking&nbsp;&nbsp; around in this kind of excruciating torment&nbsp; and distress and and don't know why and don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know don't have words. They're not able to tell&nbsp; anyone. They're not able to express it. They may&nbsp;&nbsp; just have on a smiley face mask but are screaming&nbsp; underneath the surface. Um because of this kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of programming, it's incredibly diabolical but&nbsp; incredibly effective. Oh my gosh, thank you for&nbsp;&nbsp; sharing that. That's another maybe key for people&nbsp; if they've experienced that. I'm sure tooth pain&nbsp;&nbsp; is just in general, it's some of the worst pain&nbsp; that that you could ever go through. I can't even&nbsp;&nbsp; imagine the level of taking it to electroshock.&nbsp; I don't even I just can't. And it's just horrible&nbsp;&nbsp; that they're doing this to children, you know. But&nbsp; hopefully that's a it might be a puzzle piece for&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody who's experiencing that and maybe going&nbsp; to the dentist and being treated for something&nbsp;&nbsp; that you know is is a symptom of trauma instead&nbsp; of you know a symptom of of maybe just a general&nbsp;&nbsp; tooth ache or something like that you know. So,&nbsp; I I pray that that this can maybe be helpful for&nbsp;&nbsp; people on the other side of the screen, too,&nbsp; cuz I'm sure that if it's I'm sure that that&nbsp;&nbsp; those methods are used on a lot of children, you&nbsp; know, and it might not be something that somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; remembers right away. So, I really appreciate&nbsp; you sharing that. Yeah, of course. I hate that&nbsp;&nbsp; anyone else has had to go through it and and I&nbsp; know because of how how well this infrastructure&nbsp;&nbsp; is set up. They're just cycling kids through that&nbsp; like Monarch schools the whole you know it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp; for you know they they set up Monarch Schools as a&nbsp; sort of a charitable reach outreach for lowincome&nbsp;&nbsp; uh more vulnerable children in our societies.&nbsp; I mean, because they're already fractured&nbsp;&nbsp; and programmed and and easy to continue on that&nbsp; easier to work with to continue on a mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; process. You want a mind control slave. Um, you&nbsp; know, if you have an already fractured child,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, that's, you know, that's that's where they go&nbsp; and they look for them is for children below the&nbsp;&nbsp; poverty line. And so, it's really disgusting. Um,&nbsp; and then the the picture you have up the BC flag.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I call British Columbia Atlantis. Um, it's this&nbsp; it's the seed of Satan project. And you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, that it's boasting its reigning crown&nbsp; system, the elusarian Illuminati sun worship. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; the surface of the earth now is 71% water. Um,&nbsp; and I I personally believe that is because of the&nbsp;&nbsp; increasing lawlessness that the Bible prophesies&nbsp; leading up to the return of Christ. And you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; some people refer to it as the Marine Kingdom&nbsp; Network um because Yeshua cast demons named&nbsp;&nbsp; Legion back to the sea in Mark 5. And we know a&nbsp; lot of free Masonic halls and clubs are called&nbsp;&nbsp; Legion Legions. And so that that submarine system&nbsp; there underwater is utilized by the military,&nbsp;&nbsp; the government uh and business executives for you&nbsp; know newer more sophisticated programs of of mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control. And so um you know I think that um yeah&nbsp; I think you know I have a personal theory. I think&nbsp;&nbsp; that the new world over here, you know, that&nbsp; a lot of programming took place on immigration&nbsp;&nbsp; ships when people came over here um into North&nbsp; America to establish the new world. Um it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp; my personal belief that um the new world order and&nbsp; the merchants um that are discussed in the book of&nbsp;&nbsp; Revelation that are judged for their exports is um&nbsp; North America. I I I think that a lot of people,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, it could be the Vatican, it could be&nbsp; this, it could be that, it could be, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of different theories about what that is.&nbsp; Um, but I think that a lot of a lot of programming&nbsp;&nbsp; took place on immigration ships over here to&nbsp; establish what they call the new world in order&nbsp;&nbsp; to carry the new world order through its exports&nbsp; through Hollywood, through the media, through,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, American television and basically&nbsp; disseminate um its lies and its propaganda and&nbsp;&nbsp; its deception, you know, to the rest of the world.&nbsp; And so, so the new world order as something that's&nbsp;&nbsp; coming, I think is a part of the strong delusion&nbsp; in 2 Thessalonians 2. I think we were born into&nbsp;&nbsp; um the new world order and that was it was&nbsp; actually you know established by you know&nbsp;&nbsp; you know I'm you know I'm in in my late 30s um so&nbsp; it was you know often you know so for me it would&nbsp;&nbsp; have been established around you know grandparents&nbsp; greatgrandparents that immigrated over here for me&nbsp;&nbsp; from Ireland um and so I think that these beast&nbsp; programs of mind control were established to&nbsp;&nbsp; make shells out of unaware people and that the&nbsp; veneer and this veneer of the society that most&nbsp;&nbsp; are conscious of the this so-called American dream&nbsp; and these upgrades and advancements um in you know&nbsp;&nbsp; submarine technology under the water here as is&nbsp; as you can see on the BC flag um you know these&nbsp;&nbsp; upgrades permitted the controlled opposition&nbsp; of um outdated MKLA program exposure and some&nbsp;&nbsp; payouts like the Canadian government there. There&nbsp; was exposure. There were payouts for mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; victims, but I think it was kind of like a&nbsp; controlled opposition thing. So, I'm here for&nbsp;&nbsp; the voices of those who are still trapped beneath&nbsp; these waters, these deep waters of judgment that&nbsp;&nbsp; um are coming like a flood from a throne of a&nbsp; loving God whose eye nothing escapes. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the thing everyone's waiting for, I think&nbsp; we're in it. I think that's the deception. We're&nbsp;&nbsp; all waiting for something we were born into. Um,&nbsp; and so, um, I'm grateful that there's there's an&nbsp;&nbsp; army of of righteousness that's rising and in an&nbsp; exodus towards hope, healing, and and redemption.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, because time is very short. And scripture&nbsp; says the dragon uh the dragon is is seeking&nbsp;&nbsp; um whom he may devour because Satan knows his&nbsp; time on this earth is short. And so this dragon&nbsp;&nbsp; programming through monarch through places like&nbsp; the Massie tunnel um is um is only growing as time&nbsp;&nbsp; goes on. And and thankfully, you know, we have all&nbsp; of these things have been prophesied and foretold&nbsp;&nbsp; of in scripture in and it's very clear. Um and&nbsp; so we we know that that there's an antidote. Thank you for sharing that. That's fascinating and&nbsp; horrifying all at once, but it actually makes a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of sense. And the iconography here is also&nbsp; interesting. I never really put it together in&nbsp;&nbsp; my head that like crowns also resemble the sun,&nbsp; which is kind of it's like neat to recognize that,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it also is, you know, it it's very occultic,&nbsp; you know, and again, something that's like&nbsp;&nbsp; celebrated and heralded. It's like, why even have&nbsp; a crown? But it's like, well, it makes it makes&nbsp;&nbsp; some sense if you think about it from occultic&nbsp; symbology, too. But that's really good insight for&nbsp;&nbsp; people to know and to sort of ponder. Oh, I just&nbsp; switched the screen. Indian residential school&nbsp;&nbsp; survivor on the Queen's alleged connection to&nbsp; missing children. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever&nbsp;&nbsp; you know the queen is, I wouldn't say it's a she,&nbsp; right? Um an it, more of an it. Um yeah, there is&nbsp;&nbsp; so much. Oh, there's there is so much um so there&nbsp; is just so much because these children are being&nbsp;&nbsp; gathered and collected and kidnapped to sacrifice&nbsp; to the dragon to empower the spirit of lawlessness&nbsp;&nbsp; and the spirit of the antichrist. And so there,&nbsp; you know, there's it's not hard to you don't have&nbsp;&nbsp; to do a lot of red stringing. It's hard hardly&nbsp; a conspiracy anymore, right? I have a guest that&nbsp;&nbsp; is reoccurring on my show from Canada named Kevin&nbsp; Annet who has been exposing Canadian residential&nbsp;&nbsp; and indigenous schools, the genocide that occurs&nbsp; in it. And he's he hasn't gone in depth about it,&nbsp;&nbsp; but he's mentioned, you know, that there's been&nbsp; allegations against the queen with that. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're helping to sort of connect some other dots&nbsp; from other people, too, and validate that. Um, and&nbsp;&nbsp; that's interesting that you found this headline&nbsp; for it. Yeah. Oh, that's just this picture here&nbsp;&nbsp; on the screen is is a is a picture of uh of a one&nbsp; one of many um men uh who were involved in um the&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm trying to think of a polite way to say this.&nbsp; There really isn't. And and quite frankly, I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; done being polite, but the but very demented and&nbsp; defiling pornography, including snuff films. And&nbsp;&nbsp; so, um, I was both in the films as a participant&nbsp; as well as, um, trained as a videographer, um,&nbsp;&nbsp; on professional film cameras to have to film these&nbsp; things. And, uh, this is a this is a photo of of&nbsp;&nbsp; the the man and he's doing, as you can see, if&nbsp; you look up uh, Freemason or Masonic hand signals,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, this is what they do. So, this was the photo&nbsp; that was put um in the newspaper or in the 70s&nbsp;&nbsp; when he first established what is a guitar factory&nbsp; in Vancouver. And I was trafficked to this guitar&nbsp;&nbsp; factory, taken to meet this uh person at uh at&nbsp; night um by a photographer that my school sent me&nbsp;&nbsp; with on a work practicum because I was an aspiring&nbsp; photographer. So I was 15 years old. I was doing a&nbsp;&nbsp; work placement with this photographer already.&nbsp; Huge red flag. teenage girl alone in the car&nbsp;&nbsp; with a man. Um, so he took me to this man. Um, and&nbsp; this guitar factory ended up being a location for&nbsp;&nbsp; um a very lucrative uh industry of of pornography&nbsp; in some of the most uh perverse and um yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; it was it was hard. It was I don't even have&nbsp; words. Um yeah. So that's but that's an example&nbsp;&nbsp; that I mean this photo is a photo of him taken&nbsp; in the 70s when he established um these guitars.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so that was a huge center for both trafficking&nbsp; and and pornographic uh films. Oh my gosh, that's&nbsp;&nbsp; horrific. Including including SNAF. So yeah. Yeah.&nbsp; so terrible that people don't understand that&nbsp;&nbsp; these things exist, you know, and like I mean you&nbsp; look at you look at him, we can't see his face,&nbsp;&nbsp; but he just looks like a normal person like just&nbsp; wearing a t-shirt and like he doesn't fit like&nbsp;&nbsp; what we'd think oh predator predator, you know,&nbsp; like it just looks like a normal dude that just&nbsp;&nbsp; like, you know, hangs out at dive bars and like&nbsp; plays in a band. Like that's what it looks like,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know? It's crazy that these people just&nbsp; walk among us and we have no idea. And they&nbsp;&nbsp; do and they did a lot of like side projects too&nbsp; in the programming as well. It wasn't just for&nbsp;&nbsp; u like pornography. And you can see that signal&nbsp; through you could you could see that signaled&nbsp;&nbsp; through the hand. You can come here. This is&nbsp; where you can come. You can you know bring this&nbsp;&nbsp; this person. You have a mind control slave. You&nbsp; can bring them here for this programming. A lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of us were taught uh musical skills, uh different&nbsp; things, um in order to be able to do and perform&nbsp;&nbsp; certain fetishes or acts for certain members of&nbsp; the the the brotherhood. Um and so music it music&nbsp;&nbsp; and in programming is is a really big part of&nbsp; it as well as developing particular skills and&nbsp;&nbsp; talents. And so it wasn't totally random that&nbsp; it was a guitar factory. So this is a picture&nbsp;&nbsp; that you just put on. This green hallway um is&nbsp; in the uh Halley Research Center of Antarctica.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um which is one of the laboratories for crisper&nbsp; technology that I was flown to. Um a part of me,&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean it was me. I have a part named January who&nbsp; is my Antarctica part. And so uh so she was taken&nbsp;&nbsp; there both as a subject for crisper technology&nbsp; and hybrid experiences as a remote womb and&nbsp;&nbsp; gestation for the seed of the beast. Um but I also&nbsp; worked uh as a laboratory assistant. uh January&nbsp;&nbsp; um was being trained in molecular uh biology um in&nbsp; Antarctica and it was at both this Holly research&nbsp;&nbsp; center and the Roth era research center as well.&nbsp; Um, and that information came forth because I kept&nbsp;&nbsp; having flashbacks of being in Antarctica with a&nbsp; particular program programmer having landed on a&nbsp;&nbsp; helicopter at the top of the hill looking down at&nbsp; what I was able to identify eventually on research&nbsp;&nbsp; as the Ruther Research Center. And I was wearing&nbsp; uh this orange these orange suits. I kept having&nbsp;&nbsp; these memories of these orange suits. And so I&nbsp; I started to do research and and um established&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. So, I was wearing a cold water immersion&nbsp; suit. I immersion suit um in these memories and&nbsp;&nbsp; um so then I began to look at okay, why was&nbsp; I wearing a cold water immersion suit? What&nbsp;&nbsp; is this for? Um and I didn't get very far um until&nbsp; uh this part was ready to come forward and divulge&nbsp;&nbsp; um some things that I will be releasing um in&nbsp; in my book. Um I have to wait for the fullness&nbsp;&nbsp; of the testimony and some other things to be esta&nbsp; established to um to share further details of what&nbsp;&nbsp; happened. Um there's also the Spalbard seed vault&nbsp; that's in Antarctica as well where there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of like experiments in um like biod like just a&nbsp; lot of you know they say it's just for the protect&nbsp;&nbsp; they're studying they're studying the earth they&nbsp; say they're just studying biodiversity they're&nbsp;&nbsp; you know they're studying the ozone lay the ozone&nbsp; layer they're studying the environment up there&nbsp;&nbsp; it's not it's just a highly classified projects&nbsp; and they have very specific tours to protect tend&nbsp;&nbsp; to give the public a sense of openness about&nbsp; what's really happening at these centers. But&nbsp;&nbsp; they're actually uh creating monsters in these&nbsp; laboratories both in and outside of the wombs of&nbsp;&nbsp; uh young girls um and monarch slaves. And um&nbsp; that's what I'm going to one of the things I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; going to be writing about. And here's an example&nbsp; of uh another hallway. So the last hallway you saw&nbsp;&nbsp; was create was um painted in a very specific shade&nbsp; of green um that's used in the color programming&nbsp;&nbsp; in order to activate a certain part. So, this&nbsp; is a public restroom um that I just discovered&nbsp;&nbsp; on happen stance that is a uh a place to um bring&nbsp; children um who are programmed to sexually abuse&nbsp;&nbsp; them in these spaces. Because if you have a a if&nbsp; if somebody's in the cult and they have a child&nbsp;&nbsp; who has been in this color programming, then&nbsp; this color programming is is activating this&nbsp;&nbsp; part to come forward and to receive the sexual&nbsp; trauma or to perform the sexual trauma and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh not remember it because it's a a part a&nbsp; dissociative part. And so I saw this bathroom&nbsp;&nbsp; and I just I walked into one of the stalls and I&nbsp; sat down and I began to weep and I just began to&nbsp;&nbsp; pray and just pray and just weep and pray and um&nbsp; and so this is just a really common thing. Um I&nbsp;&nbsp; don't know how many bathrooms there are that are&nbsp; painted in this specific color. Um, but one of the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh people who programmed me uh chose this paint&nbsp; color for another member of my family's kitchen&nbsp;&nbsp; to in order to keep that programming software&nbsp; reactivated um in this other member of the cult. Oh my gosh, these it's just so funky. Like&nbsp; it's hard. It almost look just looks like&nbsp;&nbsp; a center for children or some type of like,&nbsp; you know, fun house for kids. Like this is&nbsp;&nbsp; weird to think that adults would paint it this&nbsp; color for something professional. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it definitely has that vibe of mind control. And&nbsp; especially the specific colors that they chose,&nbsp;&nbsp; like you said, were no accident. It was for an&nbsp; intended purpose. It was. and and and just you&nbsp;&nbsp; know just just to be you know I have to say as&nbsp; as like it took my breath away when I saw this&nbsp;&nbsp; hallway of bathrooms. I was just at the beach. I&nbsp; walk in and I just like I could hardly breathe. I&nbsp;&nbsp; was just it took my breath away um cuz that was&nbsp; very triggering for me. But because it did not&nbsp;&nbsp; co it did not cause me to switch. So I was able&nbsp; to have that moment of healing in that bathroom&nbsp;&nbsp; stall. I didn't switch into my color programmed&nbsp; part because the word of Yahw and his grace and&nbsp;&nbsp; love has broken that down with his truth and&nbsp; he's renewing my mind and he's not giving me a&nbsp;&nbsp; spirit of fear. He's given me a sound mind. And&nbsp; so now, you know, I could walk into a situation&nbsp;&nbsp; like that and I I'm supposed to be programmed with&nbsp; that color. like in Antarctica, I walk down that&nbsp;&nbsp; hallway to go to do my task and I'm supposed to&nbsp; switch into January. But instead, I was able to&nbsp;&nbsp; be co-conscious of January and grieve with her&nbsp; and and um and and just pray in that space and&nbsp;&nbsp; and not be triggered into a dissociative state,&nbsp; but actually minister to this part of my soul.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's really amazing, too, that you&nbsp; were able to get actual photos. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; sure that there's not a lot of um things&nbsp; online where they're showcasing this. No, but if you see a color, if you see like a color&nbsp; that color in a dentist in in a dental office&nbsp;&nbsp; or a or a um any kind of institution run because&nbsp; that is there for uh that is there to make sure&nbsp;&nbsp; that their employees programmed parts come out&nbsp; to perform their tasks without them knowing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; um or even the patrons of such a such a a business&nbsp; or an institute. Um so that gate that so I just&nbsp;&nbsp; was showing some examples in these pictures here&nbsp; that you see of just an unnecessary amount of&nbsp;&nbsp; security around this bathroom. There's like bars,&nbsp; extra doors, extra dead bolts, and extra locks,&nbsp;&nbsp; which would lead me to believe that this bathroom&nbsp; isn't just um some cult member. Um and this would&nbsp;&nbsp; signal this is a very high cult community that&nbsp; this bathroom is here just as coming in with a ch&nbsp;&nbsp; with a child to abuse them. But the but this would&nbsp; facility would actually be used and locked up and&nbsp;&nbsp; um things programming would happen within within&nbsp; this bathroom. Everything is painted green too.&nbsp;&nbsp; The countertops things that I I didn't even&nbsp; picture there. Um I didn't take pictures I&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't give pictures of all of it but it's all&nbsp; painted in that color. And you'll see they've lo&nbsp;&nbsp; they they keep it like a prison. Oh my gosh.&nbsp; Yeah. That is so bizarre. That is so weird.&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like it should be some like piece&nbsp; of art or something. Just looks so out of&nbsp;&nbsp; place. Yeah. Public bathroom. Dead bolts. Yeah.&nbsp; Yeah. Like why is that why is that necessary? Yeah. That's okay. So in this picture you see&nbsp; so that is a lo the logo on the coat of an oral&nbsp;&nbsp; surgeon in the monarch program in his office.&nbsp; He has a big painting of Felix the cat that's&nbsp;&nbsp; all pixelated just like this logo you see on&nbsp; his shirt of a pixelated face. This represents&nbsp;&nbsp; fracturing the one's identity, right? Your face,&nbsp; your identity. And the pixelation represents the&nbsp;&nbsp; fracturing, the programming and these, I call it&nbsp; software that is installed through ritual torture.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so this oral surgeon when I went in at 19&nbsp; to have my wisdom teeth taken out um gave me a&nbsp;&nbsp; tetrototoxin. Um and uh this is what I believe it&nbsp; was because the anesthetic put me into a state of&nbsp;&nbsp; paralysis but full awareness. So I could not move,&nbsp; speak, but I could feel all of the pain of all of&nbsp;&nbsp; the things that he was doing to me. And he was&nbsp; very very very sadist sadistic and would um and&nbsp;&nbsp; he had uh electrodes hooked up from my brain to a&nbsp; monitor so he could see because I couldn't scream&nbsp;&nbsp; or move. He could see the level of pain that I&nbsp; was going through as he was administering certain&nbsp;&nbsp; types of torture including rape. He he got off on&nbsp; the pain the more pain I was in. And he would ask&nbsp;&nbsp; me I could hear him asking right and I can't move.&nbsp; I could hear him asking me how does this feel? How&nbsp;&nbsp; does this feel? Like it was so sick and so uh&nbsp; demented that I actually wrote a letter to him&nbsp;&nbsp; recently um anonymously to tell him I know what&nbsp; he does. I know what he is about. I remember and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh that he better repent because he is he is&nbsp; under the wrath of Yah. And um you know it was&nbsp;&nbsp; really therapeutic to write it. uh so therapeutic&nbsp; to write it that I didn't mail it but I might. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; and this part this is the personality that that&nbsp; took this traumas her name is Molina and so&nbsp;&nbsp; um uh it's still traumatic just for me even to&nbsp; go to the dentist. um this part makes it really&nbsp;&nbsp; hard to make it to the appointment and I never&nbsp; understood why for the longest time. Um you know&nbsp;&nbsp; until until I did. And was this the is this&nbsp; the the same dentist who would have you were&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about your teeth earlier and the ball that&nbsp; would go in your mouth. Was that was that any of&nbsp;&nbsp; that happened at the office or was that separate?&nbsp; Completely separate. This was a one-time occasion,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it was especially horrific what he did. Um,&nbsp; the electricity that he did, it was a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; like electrocuting like probes of electrocuting&nbsp; rape in every orifice. Um, and then sealed off,&nbsp;&nbsp; uh, you know, with his own, you know, getting off&nbsp; on it all. Yeah. Yeah. So, it wasn't scary enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh my gosh. Yeah. When I looked him up, when the&nbsp; memories came back in, um I I when I looked him up&nbsp;&nbsp; and I saw his website and I saw this logo logo,&nbsp; I mean, he's very, you know, does very well. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; when I saw this picture of him with that logo,&nbsp; again, this is the type of confirmation that I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about when I have memories and and I want&nbsp; to validate them. You just do a little research.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay, here's the guy I remember. Okay. Yep. Here's&nbsp; his website. Oh, Monarch program. Look, look at&nbsp;&nbsp; he's got butterflies all over his waiting room.&nbsp; You know, look at this. Look at that. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's just all of these validating things. Not that&nbsp; that's necessary in order to for your memories to&nbsp;&nbsp; be valid, but it does, you know, it does help&nbsp; and it it's pretty interesting. the I was also&nbsp;&nbsp; uh I was also um the dental and the orthodont&nbsp; the orthodontist or oral surgeon industry is&nbsp;&nbsp; really just um I mean I think that there's a&nbsp; reason the high sui one of the highest suicide&nbsp;&nbsp; rates as far as careers are concerned as a dentist&nbsp; because there's the omega programming which is the&nbsp;&nbsp; suicide programming um that is is created in the&nbsp; event that something goes wrong or somebody's is&nbsp;&nbsp; disobedient or wants to get out. Um because these&nbsp; dentists have access to anesthetic and I worked&nbsp;&nbsp; for an orthodontist. I nannied for his family. I&nbsp; I looked after his daughter for 10 years. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp; this was a a job that was set up by my handler. Um&nbsp; and so he was a big part of of of my programming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, and he um um, as it turned out, hired me&nbsp; to actually I thought I was just nannying um,&nbsp;&nbsp; for the family, but uh, because I was a slave&nbsp; of this cult um, he had actually hired me to&nbsp;&nbsp; participate in programming his young daughter.&nbsp; Um, which is really which is really hard um,&nbsp;&nbsp; to um, reconcile. Um, yeah. Oh my gosh, this is&nbsp; all just so eye opening what you're sharing. And&nbsp;&nbsp; this was this dentist is separate from the other&nbsp; photos that we were showing of the green facility.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was there anything else from Antarctica that you&nbsp; wanted to share? Not yet. Yeah, I think that's&nbsp;&nbsp; good for now. Um, well, I will share. Okay, so I&nbsp; will share. There is a huge huge huge huge huge&nbsp;&nbsp; huge seed vault of genetic seed uh bloodline&nbsp; seed um pertaining to the Trump family. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and so a lot of my um, involvement there, um, was&nbsp; overseeing and monitoring and creating petri dish&nbsp;&nbsp; embryos, um, for the lucky chosen of the&nbsp; cult who would receive um, would receive&nbsp;&nbsp; an implantation that they would believe was a&nbsp; natural pregnancy between them and their spouse,&nbsp;&nbsp; but grafted in to the the genes uh between the the&nbsp; the um the helix uh the helix on the mom's side,&nbsp;&nbsp; the helix on the dad's side, and then you have&nbsp; the helix from like a hybrid or a bloodline&nbsp;&nbsp; family like Trump would be grafted in just like&nbsp; Hit, you know, the Nazis have been doing this&nbsp;&nbsp; forever. This is a big thing that Hitler was all&nbsp; about. He wanted to create all kinds of little&nbsp;&nbsp; Hitlers. And so he so the Nazis were really big on&nbsp; experimenting on how to impregnate as many women&nbsp;&nbsp; as possible with the seed of Hitler. And so that's&nbsp; a big part of this this spirit of the Antichrist.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so there are a ton of people walking around&nbsp; uh who have um Trump genetics that have no idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't mean they're not biologically their&nbsp; their parents that they know. Um, but they would&nbsp;&nbsp; graft they would graft in an extra helix um in&nbsp; these laboratories in order to spread the seed&nbsp;&nbsp; of Satan or the seed of Lucifer or the seed of&nbsp; the beast, however you want to look at it. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and this is not new. The the the fallen ones or&nbsp; the Nephilim have been teaching humankind to do&nbsp;&nbsp; this um, you know, since the beginning. read the&nbsp; book of Jeremiah, the book of Jude. Um I have a&nbsp;&nbsp; picture on the slideshow here that anyone can&nbsp; screenshot um coming up of biblical references&nbsp;&nbsp; um so that uh you we can see this is this is not&nbsp; just something that is being made up. This is the&nbsp;&nbsp; state of hum of our world from the beginning.&nbsp; this war has been going on. And there it is&nbsp;&nbsp; for anybody watching. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Take&nbsp; a picture for sure. Uh can the Canaanites in&nbsp;&nbsp; scripture were trafficked um you know humankind&nbsp; is just depraved um is just depraved um without&nbsp;&nbsp; you know a compass of righteousness that that I I&nbsp; really believe you know we find in his word and um you know uh I really recommend looking these&nbsp; up. you'll find them fascinating. Um Jeremiah&nbsp;&nbsp; 5 talks about how the rich are the devourers&nbsp; of children and that devouring of children is&nbsp;&nbsp; a judgment for turning aside from Yahw because&nbsp; iniquity only increases and multiplies itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sin begets sin. Um, Zechariah 11:17 talks about,&nbsp; you know, Freemason style shepherds, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; who who who have these weird swords and rituals&nbsp; pertaining to their right eye um and their arms&nbsp;&nbsp; that you seem masons today making hand signals&nbsp; with. Um Jeremiah 57:3 talks about people who&nbsp;&nbsp; sacrifice their children among the oak trees.&nbsp; Well, we know Bohemian Grove and oak trees are&nbsp;&nbsp; a huge part of free Masonic culture. Um Isaiah&nbsp; 57 goes on to talk about um those who slaughter&nbsp;&nbsp; their children under ravines, under clefts and&nbsp; crags. Um, a lot of today's Masonic buildings,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, measurements and themes visually pertained&nbsp; to Solomon's temple. Um, some still use certain&nbsp;&nbsp; specifications like that um, based on 1 Chronicles&nbsp; 22, 2 Chronicles 20. Um, and um, and and and&nbsp;&nbsp; they insire themselves in their own net. And Yah&nbsp; according to um Psalm 9 avenges all of this blood&nbsp;&nbsp; that is spilled. And he does not ignore the cries&nbsp; of the afflicted. And he says that he is known by&nbsp;&nbsp; his acts of justice and that these specific wicked&nbsp; people are ins snared by the works of their hands.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, Leviticus talks about wizards being&nbsp; put to death who are giving seed to moolak,&nbsp;&nbsp; drinking blood, using enchantments. Um, it's all&nbsp; in the word. We don't we don't need as as much as&nbsp;&nbsp; like podcasts and documentaries. All of these are&nbsp; so valuable and continue to be valuable in my life&nbsp;&nbsp; and in the lives of many. It's, you know, it's all&nbsp; in the word. There's nothing new under the sun as&nbsp;&nbsp; it says in Ecclesiastes. And so, and so I wanted&nbsp; to put these scriptures forth because if all of&nbsp;&nbsp; this is true and it's still going on and it has&nbsp; always been, then there is an antidote. And and&nbsp;&nbsp; the antidote isn't just found in the word, it&nbsp; is the word itself. It is alive. And so I just&nbsp;&nbsp; really encourage people to get into it and see if&nbsp; these things are true because if this is true then&nbsp;&nbsp; um everything else that is written in this book&nbsp; is as well. And there's good news as horrific as&nbsp;&nbsp; all of this is. There's a lot of good news. Yes,&nbsp; there is. And another survivor that you mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp; earlier, Nathan Reynolds, he also speaks on,&nbsp; and I I don't remember if it's the exact same&nbsp;&nbsp; um scriptures that you picked out here, but&nbsp; he's been a big advocate for sharing different&nbsp;&nbsp; um scriptures and passages of where SR, did um&nbsp; you know, human sacrifice, these different things&nbsp;&nbsp; existed in the Bible and that that we can, like&nbsp; you said, go back in time and see it. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa Meister has talked about um that a little bit&nbsp; on some of her shows. So, I mean, there are we are&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of seeing the world through a different lens.&nbsp; And I think the reason why people currently have&nbsp;&nbsp; not is because the lack of knowledge on did SRRA,&nbsp; mind control. They just don't know what they're&nbsp;&nbsp; reading. Where when you learn about this stuff&nbsp; and then you go back to the Bible and look, you&nbsp;&nbsp; can sort of see see it clear as day that there's&nbsp; that there's multiple examples. and you gave a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of them. So, I do encourage people to do their own&nbsp; research, take a screenshot, go check it out. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; do you have any episodes or I know your podcast&nbsp; isn't up. Um, have you done a podcast on anybody&nbsp;&nbsp; else's show that has gone through some of these&nbsp; more in depth? Not yet. Uh, would love to do&nbsp;&nbsp; that at some time. It would be awesome because&nbsp; this just scratches the surface. Even this list&nbsp;&nbsp; of scriptures there, that's just the tip of the&nbsp; iceberg. There there are far more references. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; but if you want to subscribe to our our YouTube&nbsp; channel, um, uh, right now we just have the music&nbsp;&nbsp; and, um, we may release something like that in&nbsp; the future. Um, and so if if you're curious on&nbsp;&nbsp; staying tuned, um, you can, um, there's a passage&nbsp; in the book of wisdom, and I I don't quote the&nbsp;&nbsp; book of wisdom. It's by King Solomon. I don't&nbsp; I don't quote this as the inspired word of Yah,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the writings of antiquity are super valid,&nbsp; as a historical account of what was happening&nbsp;&nbsp; then. It's happening now. And it says here, I&nbsp; have I have a quote um that I just wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp; share because this was written in between the&nbsp; first first century BC and first century AD.&nbsp;&nbsp; It says, \"For your judgments, for Yahw's judgments&nbsp; are great and hard to interpret. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp; undisiplined souls went astray.\" Now, listen this.&nbsp; Tell me if you think this sounds like a did or a a&nbsp;&nbsp; fractured soul to you with amnesic barriers.&nbsp; It says, \"For when lawless men had supposed&nbsp;&nbsp; that they held a holy nation in their power, they&nbsp; prisoners of darkness and bound in the feathers&nbsp;&nbsp; of a long night, kept close beneath their roofs,&nbsp; lay exiled from the eternal providence. For while&nbsp;&nbsp; they thought that they were unseen in their secret&nbsp; sins, they were divided from one another by a dark&nbsp;&nbsp; curtain of forgetfulness, stricken with terrible&nbsp; awe and very troubled by apparitions. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; it sounds a lot like somebody going through like&nbsp; the torment of a mental illness or schizophrenia&nbsp;&nbsp; or somebody who's just really suffering and&nbsp; and doesn't understand why. It could be a dark&nbsp;&nbsp; curtain of forgetfulness through trauma, through&nbsp; these very sadistic means that are generationally&nbsp;&nbsp; practiced and handed down through um through many&nbsp; generations. And then it says, \"For neither did&nbsp;&nbsp; the dark recesses that held them guard them from&nbsp; their fears, but terrifying sounds rang around&nbsp;&nbsp; them, and dismal phantoms appeared with unsmiling&nbsp; faces.\" And it goes on. I mean, so the book of&nbsp;&nbsp; wisdom is really interesting and it talks about&nbsp; this, I believe, exactly what we're talking about&nbsp;&nbsp; today. Wow. That would be kind of a an interesting&nbsp; episode to do with you sometime to pour focus into&nbsp;&nbsp; just that topic. I think listeners would be really&nbsp; curious to learn about that too. So maybe we could&nbsp;&nbsp; plan doing that sometime, you know, and and&nbsp; like do a real deep dive into the ones that you&nbsp;&nbsp; provided today, which I hope that you guys took&nbsp; a screenshot of. if not go back and do it. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and then you know any others that you want to add&nbsp; to it? We could sort of spend some time looking&nbsp;&nbsp; at them through a different lens. That would be&nbsp; great. It would be that would be I would be such&nbsp;&nbsp; a blessing. I'd love to dig in deeper. Uh cuz, you&nbsp; know, these, you know, wisdom book of wisdom even&nbsp;&nbsp; talks about dragons, the worshiping of dragons&nbsp; and uh irrational reptiles and, you know, um&nbsp;&nbsp; Jasher and Enoch as well. And then of course, you&nbsp; know, all all through scripture. It would be good&nbsp;&nbsp; to it would be good to do an episode. I'd love to&nbsp; explore and dig into more of why all of this is&nbsp;&nbsp; taking place. Um because it's really important um&nbsp; that we thoroughly understand the world in which&nbsp;&nbsp; we live in. Amen. Let's talk about that after.&nbsp; Maybe we can look at the schedule and and plan&nbsp;&nbsp; something in the, you know, near future in the&nbsp; next couple months and do a deep dive. That would&nbsp;&nbsp; be great. And for this episode, was there anything&nbsp; that we didn't cover that you wanted to share? Um, I think that was we covered so much. you know,&nbsp; I'm there's still questions that I'm sure people&nbsp;&nbsp; are going to have and there's like so many&nbsp; different, you know, more conversations that&nbsp;&nbsp; we could probably have about all the stuff that&nbsp; we talked about today. So, maybe we do a part&nbsp;&nbsp; three of your testimony and we can take questions&nbsp; from people and and maybe dive a little bit deeper&nbsp;&nbsp; into some of the stuff that we talked about&nbsp; towards the end. Um, and then we can plan an&nbsp;&nbsp; episode to do a biblical deep dive too and sort&nbsp; of uncover what our eyes haven't seen, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; or what most people haven't. And now that we have&nbsp; sort of a renewed way that we look at the world,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, it would be really interesting to do that and&nbsp; maybe do some Q&amp;A for people who have questions&nbsp;&nbsp; for you. That would be awesome. I I would that&nbsp; would be great. uh would be just a joy to talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about this because the more we understand it, the&nbsp; more common we realize it is and the more people&nbsp;&nbsp; can discover um the salvation uh that we really&nbsp; need that has been so well hidden from us. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp; and maybe we could talk to a little bit about&nbsp; um some children's games that were used uh in&nbsp;&nbsp; programming as well. Um, I'm not sure I have heard&nbsp; not I, you know, I don't listen to a ton. Um, but&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't I haven't heard uh how children's games&nbsp; like Hungry Hippo, Trouble, and Sorry have been&nbsp;&nbsp; used in programming. They were used in mine. A&nbsp; lot of these games were developed through military&nbsp;&nbsp; um veterans by military veterans. And so maybe&nbsp; we could talk about um Hungry Hippo or I could&nbsp;&nbsp; call it I like to call it Hungry Hippo campus and&nbsp; what it means to lose your marbles. Oh my gosh,&nbsp;&nbsp; what a pun. Holy smokes. Yes, that would be really&nbsp; really valuable. Again, people are trying to move&nbsp;&nbsp; away from the things that they have access to&nbsp; in real life, movies, music, um facilities,&nbsp;&nbsp; businesses. I think this could be another way&nbsp; too that we could educate parents, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I think that would be really fascinating or&nbsp; video games, you know, I think there's so many&nbsp;&nbsp; different ways that what you went through in this&nbsp; actual program, you know, affects children that&nbsp;&nbsp; are outside of it in the real life. They've&nbsp; they've duplicated that in actual, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; society, too. A lot of these things. So, it'd be&nbsp; really good to spend some time going through some&nbsp;&nbsp; of that and helping shine a light on, you know,&nbsp; for survivors, too, who might have gone through&nbsp;&nbsp; that and might not remember or might not be clear&nbsp; or might have not not have talked about it yet. I&nbsp;&nbsp; actually haven't heard of these games being used.&nbsp; So, it would be a new topic for for listeners as&nbsp;&nbsp; well to to hear about and learn about. So, let's&nbsp; definitely plan, you know, at least a couple more&nbsp;&nbsp; episodes and we can do some deep dives into&nbsp; some of this stuff. Cool. Awesome. Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp; I appreciate today. I appreciate you. You shared&nbsp; so much and so much of this was I know just like&nbsp;&nbsp; the hardest things in life to talk about, you&nbsp; know, and the fact that you are able to bear your&nbsp;&nbsp; soul the way that you do, emotions and all exactly&nbsp; authentic to who you are and to share it in a way&nbsp;&nbsp; that that the audience can be touched by it and&nbsp; can hear the reality of these things. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; the details of of your children to the details&nbsp; of programming and locations and um you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; how these things are are presented to our children&nbsp; in the form of books and entertainment, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I just really appreciate your candid and&nbsp; honest uh education that you give us on your&nbsp;&nbsp; experiences and on these things. And then I&nbsp; also really appreciate you always always and I&nbsp;&nbsp; don't know if you do this I think you just do this&nbsp; naturally but you the hardest things that you talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about by the end of it people feel hope you spin&nbsp; things around to be very hopeful to be positive&nbsp;&nbsp; to have wisdom behind it lessons that we can learn&nbsp; ways that we can keep going when we feel like we&nbsp;&nbsp; want to give up um and you do that in in in a way&nbsp; that I think and wish that more people would would&nbsp;&nbsp; look at life, you know. So, I think the more that&nbsp; that we sort of listen to these situations and how&nbsp;&nbsp; you and others have overcome them, you know, we're&nbsp; giving people hope, too. So, I really appreciate&nbsp;&nbsp; you sharing all this and then also bringing up&nbsp; shining the light on it in a way where we can take&nbsp;&nbsp; something meaningful away from it that can benefit&nbsp; us, whether it's education or a tool for healing&nbsp;&nbsp; it. Um, you know, or just a different perspective&nbsp; to look at how we can switch something like shame&nbsp;&nbsp; around, you know, and and and take away a positive&nbsp; from it. So, thank you, Kadia, with all my heart&nbsp;&nbsp; for coming on here, for being a leader in this&nbsp; community, for bearing your soul, and just for&nbsp;&nbsp; being an absolutely amazing woman, mother, friend,&nbsp; and human being.

We put on the belt&nbsp;&nbsp; of truth to protect against lies and deception. We&nbsp; put on the breastplate of righteousness to protect&nbsp;&nbsp; our hearts from the temptations. We put the gospel&nbsp; of peace on our feet to walk in your light, peace,&nbsp;&nbsp; and freedom with the Holy Spirit. We rebuke&nbsp; anxious thoughts. We take up your shield of&nbsp;&nbsp; faith for protection to block and destroy all&nbsp; the darts and threats thrown at us by the enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We put on the helmet of salvation to cover&nbsp; our minds and thoughts, reminding us that we&nbsp;&nbsp; are children of a mighty king. We are forgiven,&nbsp; set free, saved by the blood of Jesus. We take&nbsp;&nbsp; up the sword of the spirit, your living word&nbsp; that has the power to demolish strongholds&nbsp;&nbsp; and is sharper than any double-edged sword. We&nbsp; come to you, Lord, in prayer daily. In Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp; mighty name we pray. Amen. Amen. What's up, you&nbsp; guys? Welcome to the Imagination. I'm your host,&nbsp;&nbsp; Emma, and today I'm absolutely honored to&nbsp; introduce you all to satanic ritual abuse,&nbsp;&nbsp; MK Ultra Mind Control, covert experimentation,&nbsp; an organized abuse survivor, whistleblower,&nbsp;&nbsp; and overcomer, artist and painter, writer,&nbsp; songwriter, spiritual conduit, and healer,&nbsp;&nbsp; and a woman who transforms the unspeakable into&nbsp; a testament of the soul's unyielding sovereignty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnolia Dove, born into a lineage marked by&nbsp; survival and struggle. Magnolia's story began with&nbsp;&nbsp; roots in her mother's Holocaust survivor heritage&nbsp; and a rare AB positive bloodline, which made her a&nbsp;&nbsp; target immediately from birth. While the specifics&nbsp; of generational abuse remain partly shrouded,&nbsp;&nbsp; the echoes of trauma reverberated through her&nbsp; family. Her childhood spent in the loving yet&nbsp;&nbsp; dysfunctional embrace of her parents, an only&nbsp; child navigating her father's cocaine addiction,&nbsp;&nbsp; was marred by early dissociation, a survival&nbsp; mechanism that veiled her earliest memories.&nbsp;&nbsp; At age 5, the darkness descended fully, Magnolia&nbsp; became a target of ritual abuse and mind control.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ins snared by perpetrators tied to MK Ultra and&nbsp; Stargate projects, the sisters of Darkness Coven,&nbsp;&nbsp; and even her best friend's parents who were linked&nbsp; to the Warner Brothers and Hollywood circles. Her&nbsp;&nbsp; formative years were a battleground at private&nbsp; school and later in public schools. Magnolia&nbsp;&nbsp; was subjected to routine programming even as she&nbsp; excelled in her school's gate programs. The abuse&nbsp;&nbsp; was harrowing. satanic rituals where she was hung&nbsp; upside down, adrenalized blood being extracted,&nbsp;&nbsp; a shallow coffin burial with snakes and bugs,&nbsp; electroshock wands, starvation and padded rooms,&nbsp;&nbsp; bamboo shoots under her fingernails, and more&nbsp; as part of her brutal traumabased mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; programming. At Warner Brothers linked gatherings,&nbsp; she even endured child adult fetish parties,&nbsp;&nbsp; a grim echo of the movie Eyed Wise Shut.&nbsp; These horrors, layered with drug-induced&nbsp;&nbsp; programming and near-death experiences, sought to&nbsp; fracture her spirit. The abuse began to wne around&nbsp;&nbsp; age nine when key perpetrators, including&nbsp; her primary babysitter and sexual abuser,&nbsp;&nbsp; moved away. MK Ultra's grip loosened, though&nbsp; sporadic access for programming persisted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnolia buried these memories deep, blocking&nbsp; them out into adulthood, a survival strategy&nbsp;&nbsp; that allowed her to move forward until the past&nbsp; demanded reckoning. Just over a decade ago,&nbsp;&nbsp; a chilling memory of a perpetrator's Russian&nbsp; roulette threat unlocked a flood of memories&nbsp;&nbsp; linked to satanic ritual abuse. Over the next few&nbsp; years, the pieces coalesed, revealing the truth of&nbsp;&nbsp; her life that had been mentally compartmentalized.&nbsp; Magnolia's healing journey has been as fierce as&nbsp;&nbsp; her survival. Initially, her treatments offered&nbsp; little emotional support and trauma rehab provided&nbsp;&nbsp; only surface level understanding of her complex&nbsp; trauma and PTSD. Her true healing came through&nbsp;&nbsp; unconventional and holistic paths and a profound&nbsp; connection to Jesus Christ through deliverance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Magnolia stands as a whole, vibrant soul&nbsp; with many memories integrated, yet ever curious&nbsp;&nbsp; about the gaps in her story. Her decision to speak&nbsp; out is driven by a desire to provide hope, to fill&nbsp;&nbsp; in other survivors fragmented memories, and to&nbsp; reclaim her testimony. As a songwriter, painter,&nbsp;&nbsp; writer, and healer, she is a master at turning&nbsp; the painful into the beautiful into creations that&nbsp;&nbsp; resonate with ancient wisdom and urgent relevance.&nbsp; her work as a lifeline for those navigating the&nbsp;&nbsp; liinal space between trauma and transcendence.&nbsp; As a radiant vessel of Yeshua's divine light,&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnolia channels transformative healing messages&nbsp; and profound spiritual wisdom, guiding those&nbsp;&nbsp; yearning for restoration and truth through their&nbsp; deepest wounds. With unwavering devotion, she&nbsp;&nbsp; creates a sacred sanctuary for survivors of ritual&nbsp; abuse, SRRA, and mind control, offering services&nbsp;&nbsp; like deliverance, boundless compassion, and a path&nbsp; to wholeness and reintegration. Magnolia's voice&nbsp;&nbsp; is soft yet unshakable. Her art a bridge between&nbsp; worlds, her healing practice, a restoration of&nbsp;&nbsp; what was stolen. She is more than just a survivor.&nbsp; She is a warriorist and a thor proving that even&nbsp;&nbsp; the darkest experiences be transformed into&nbsp; light. Through her testimony, Magnolia invites&nbsp;&nbsp; others to reclaim their sovereignty, offering a&nbsp; message of hope. Quote, \"The shadows may wound,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the spirit endures, and in its resilience, it&nbsp; creates beauty that cannot be erased.\" End quote.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before wrapping up the introduction of today's&nbsp; guest, I'd like to share just a couple quick&nbsp;&nbsp; reminders and updates.

My new friend, and the&nbsp; brightest light in a world of darkness, the one,&nbsp;&nbsp; the only Magnolia Dove. Magnolia, thank you so&nbsp; much for being here with us today. It's such&nbsp;&nbsp; an honor to have you on. Wow. Thank you so much.&nbsp; That was such an amazing introduction. It It made&nbsp;&nbsp; me emotional. You're so worthy of it. You deserve&nbsp; pages of an intro. Uh I'm that didn't go on for&nbsp;&nbsp; half the show. I could have said so much more&nbsp; about you. Um incredible. I am I was blown away&nbsp;&nbsp; by the harrowing details that you shared with your&nbsp; story. And then once we finally got to connect and&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard your voice, I was just aruck with how&nbsp; positive, with how upbeat, and I know it's not&nbsp;&nbsp; like that every single day, but just seeing the&nbsp; woman that you are today and what you've overcome&nbsp;&nbsp; and then understanding where you came from is just&nbsp; it's a miracle in itself. And I'm really thrilled&nbsp;&nbsp; that you've decided to come on here and share with&nbsp; others. I think you have a really big piece to the&nbsp;&nbsp; puzzle on so many different levels for people. you&nbsp; have a really comprehensive story that goes beyond&nbsp;&nbsp; um a lot of different uh scenarios, industries,&nbsp; socio and economic classes. I mean, there's just&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of different layers I think that people&nbsp; will be able to connect with and get puzzle&nbsp;&nbsp; pieces from, you know, and I think um you're&nbsp; a wonderful representative for this community,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I'm just really honored and proud of you&nbsp; for coming on and sharing your testimony for&nbsp;&nbsp; the first time like this. Wow. Thank you so much&nbsp; for having me. Um and that amazing introduction&nbsp;&nbsp; and you know we forget things about ourselves&nbsp; sometimes like it's you know a nice reminder you&nbsp;&nbsp; know when we're when we are with ourselves our&nbsp; our entire lives we you know we forget that we&nbsp;&nbsp; did really overcome all of that. it's easy to kind&nbsp; of go into like well what am I not doing or what&nbsp;&nbsp; could I be doing better and the crit you know the&nbsp; criticism or um so thank you it it's I do I also&nbsp;&nbsp; feel that it has you know watching other survivors&nbsp; come forward listening to other testimonies I've&nbsp;&nbsp; been you know just knowing wow my story kind of&nbsp; bridges to that and and because I experienced, you know, sort of different pockets of it. I Yes,&nbsp; I do feel that this could fill in gaps for people.&nbsp;&nbsp; It it definitely brings more clarity and&nbsp; understanding which is important for just&nbsp;&nbsp; all of us like a reckoning of of coming to terms&nbsp; with that this is really happening on this planet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um sometimes I think it's just so unbelievable&nbsp; for people to recognize. I couldn't agree more&nbsp;&nbsp; and people aren't wrong. It is. These are the most&nbsp; heinous crimes. It literally is too unbelievable&nbsp;&nbsp; and crazy sometimes to even wrap your mind around.&nbsp; Even when you do believe it, just hearing some of&nbsp;&nbsp; these things that that somebody like you has&nbsp; overcome and at such a young age, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and and these impossible scenarios and decisions&nbsp; and choices that you had to make as just a small&nbsp;&nbsp; child, you know, and it really is it's it's a&nbsp; huge shock to the world, but ultimately, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; this really is the reality that we're living in.&nbsp; And a lot of this stuff could be very preventable.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could be exposed, you know, and and it could&nbsp; have some sort of justice in the form of stopping&nbsp;&nbsp; it and helping survivors on the other end of it&nbsp; who are ignored and erased and silenced, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and and sharing these testimonies, I think, is a&nbsp; way to do that. It's a way to create validation,&nbsp;&nbsp; to create cooperation, and on the other side of&nbsp; that to to help other survivors who are just going&nbsp;&nbsp; through it, you know, know that they're not alone.&nbsp; and that other people have gone through things&nbsp;&nbsp; like they have and that they aren't crazy cuz of&nbsp; course you're going to think that you are. The&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff literally does. It sounds crazy to hear. I&nbsp; can't imagine remembering it and oh yeah, like oh&nbsp;&nbsp; my god that happened, you know. So of course, of&nbsp; course people have a hard time believing it, but&nbsp;&nbsp; it's still happening and we really have to help&nbsp; society understand that so they feel empowered&nbsp;&nbsp; and ready to to stop it, you know, and help expose&nbsp; it. And so it's really important what what you're&nbsp;&nbsp; doing. Um, I'm excited to talk about the work&nbsp; that you do. You actually work with survivors,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is amazing. And you have an incredible story&nbsp; from, you know, these the absolute most darkest,&nbsp;&nbsp; heinous things in the world to finding the divine&nbsp; light, you know, and and everything in between.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I'm excited to sort of go on this journey with&nbsp; you. Um, so I thought maybe if it's okay with you,&nbsp;&nbsp; we'd sort of paint the scene a little bit. So,&nbsp; you're you're an only child and so maybe if I&nbsp;&nbsp; know that that your family history is still a&nbsp; little bit spotty and we obviously want to keep&nbsp;&nbsp; privacy respected for your safety and uh you&nbsp; know and for protection. Um but do you want to&nbsp;&nbsp; share a little bit about your family background?&nbsp; Anything that you do know that might be important&nbsp;&nbsp; to your story and then we can start talking&nbsp; about your childhood after that. Yeah. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, I was born and raised in eastern Long Island&nbsp; in the Hamptons, in East Hampton. My family, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; my parents are from the Bronx. My mother's side&nbsp; is, so from my grandmother's side of my mother,&nbsp;&nbsp; she's a Holocaust survivor. So she came over from&nbsp; Hungary with her sister and actually nine of her&nbsp;&nbsp; brothers and sisters were killed allegedly in&nbsp; different concentration camps. And so my mother's&nbsp;&nbsp; mother came here really not knowing anyone,&nbsp; you know, having a few connections with family,&nbsp;&nbsp; her sister as one and some cousins and went to&nbsp; work in a bar in like a a beauty parlor and was&nbsp;&nbsp; raising my mother barely speaking English and&nbsp; um you know, a a very kind uh woman who was the&nbsp;&nbsp; landlord of my grandmother kind of took my mother&nbsp; in in a lot of ways. And I think that that's that&nbsp;&nbsp; had a a lot to do with my mother turning out good&nbsp; on many levels, even though this has happened&nbsp;&nbsp; uh to me. And I and I still have some questions&nbsp; to whether she was an MK Ultra survivor directly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um because of that, I'm not sure. my father's&nbsp; side are uh mostly Romanian and Russian. So&nbsp;&nbsp; we're originally on the Hungarian side. The origin&nbsp; is actually Transylvania on the border. So it's&nbsp;&nbsp; that like how I've kind of like come to terms with&nbsp; it is it's that that Roma psychic bloodline. you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, there's a lot of that um kind of heightened&nbsp; awareness in that bloodline. And um but as far as&nbsp;&nbsp; on my father's side, I really haven't been able&nbsp; to get much history. I know that he was in the&nbsp;&nbsp; army for a short period of time as a chef. And I&nbsp; think he was raised like pretty middle to upper&nbsp;&nbsp; middle class. And my mother was raised pretty poor&nbsp; uh lower class and is a self-made woman. But I was&nbsp;&nbsp; born in New York City in Mount Sinai Hospital&nbsp; and a C-section baby and really spent my whole&nbsp;&nbsp; childhood mostly in East Hampton, born and raised.&nbsp; And we did spend a few months out of the year in&nbsp;&nbsp; the Turks and Caos. They had a beach house there&nbsp; that they had when they first met they were like&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of traveling hippies and they decided to&nbsp; build a house there. And so we would go there&nbsp;&nbsp; for yeah a few months out of the year. I would&nbsp; do a little bit of schooling there. My schooling&nbsp;&nbsp; though was extremely spotty with the amount&nbsp; of schools I went to before the age of eight.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so your parents from what you know um they&nbsp; and one thing too that that you had mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp; which I thought was significant was your dad had&nbsp; addiction problems you know which which a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; times can be a symptom of trauma you know&nbsp; and and adults trying to contend with that.&nbsp;&nbsp; So even though you don't know for sure, it does&nbsp; sort of seem like even if your parents didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; go through what you did, maybe they had been&nbsp; victimized in some way throughout their life&nbsp;&nbsp; just with how the people that they were around and&nbsp; sort of some of the um some of the the symptoms&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe that they were showing a little bit that&nbsp; maybe you could notice now as an adult looking&nbsp;&nbsp; back that you didn't necessarily see as a child.&nbsp; Yes. Yeah, there was I I remember them having like&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of hippie artist kind of parties and I do&nbsp; remember my father holding me when I was little&nbsp;&nbsp; and and feeling that he was out of it, that&nbsp; he was in pain and because I'm such an empath,&nbsp;&nbsp; I I could feel that off of him. Um, and my mother&nbsp; admits that up until I think I was maybe up,&nbsp;&nbsp; she says up until I was four, but it could have&nbsp; gone on longer, but that he struggled and that at&nbsp;&nbsp; one point she was going to leave him if he didn't&nbsp; stop. And then he absolutely did stop. Uh, and I&nbsp;&nbsp; also want to point out that one of my main sexual&nbsp; perpetrators is linked directly to my father with&nbsp;&nbsp; drugs. Whether he targeted my father because of&nbsp; the group, the babysitter. It was a a group of&nbsp;&nbsp; babysitters, three women, um that did daytime&nbsp; traffic us. And it's possible that that is his&nbsp;&nbsp; linked link to my father. Uh or but it's a it was&nbsp; a small community is my point. And they definitely&nbsp;&nbsp; were involved in drug use slash um distribution&nbsp; like drug dealing together. And I do have memories&nbsp;&nbsp; of being left with this man alone. Sorry, that's&nbsp; horrifying. Mhm. Looking back at your childhood,&nbsp;&nbsp; you do and people understand what we're talking&nbsp; about with layers and like different um sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; compartments of society in a sense that your story&nbsp; intertwines with and industries. when did maybe&nbsp;&nbsp; the first abuse or dysfunction start in in your&nbsp; life as a child? And maybe we can sort of unfold&nbsp;&nbsp; it in order as they um as these different people&nbsp; and these different industries and different&nbsp;&nbsp; um layers sort of start piling on each&nbsp; other. Okay. So, I mean it is hard to know the first abuse because it depends on what abuse we're talking about.&nbsp; Like the first time I was taken to a safe&nbsp;&nbsp; house I feel was very early. I feel like I&nbsp; was not preverbal but just verbal enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; four or five a as early as four or five where um I&nbsp; was taken all of the abuse really feels the way my&nbsp;&nbsp; memories had come up was because they came up and&nbsp; you know I had repressed them. the first memories&nbsp;&nbsp; that came up and sometimes I think the mind will&nbsp; show you the first almost screen memories that&nbsp;&nbsp; aren't maybe as bad or severe as others. So it's&nbsp; as your psyche can handle them. So, I did start to&nbsp;&nbsp; remember in 2010 that there was a man and I'm&nbsp; almost like, should I just say his name? Uh, his name was Bobby. And he he would sexually&nbsp; abuse me. He would sexually abuse his own family&nbsp;&nbsp; members, his stepdaughter and and biological&nbsp; son and stepson. And I was left alone with him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was accessed by him at the babysitters&nbsp; who had had trafficked us during the day&nbsp;&nbsp; and were planning to sell my virginity&nbsp; because I witnessed that conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I witnessed a lot of things in that&nbsp; in that in that um trafficking circle.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a satanic cult, the Sisters&nbsp; of Darkness, and they were involved&nbsp;&nbsp; in trafficking for money-making purposes,&nbsp; obviously. And I remember being downstairs uh very late with this babysitter and we were&nbsp; my mother was late to pick me up and so she had&nbsp;&nbsp; me come down with her to fold laundry. And there&nbsp; was another woman over who was connected to her,&nbsp;&nbsp; also a neighborhood babysitter that would have&nbsp; these groups of kids over over to her house. And&nbsp;&nbsp; she was talking about the business of trafficking&nbsp; children and like talking her into it. And I&nbsp;&nbsp; just remember them speaking about like she was&nbsp; convincing this other babysitter to do this, that&nbsp;&nbsp; her husband wouldn't have to work three jobs, um&nbsp; that she has all of this access to children. And you know, it's hard to put a total timeline&nbsp; on it, but I believe within a few weeks of&nbsp;&nbsp; that is when a lot of this operation really&nbsp; started going. And sometimes it was someone,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, paying to watch a child get humiliated,&nbsp;&nbsp; like watch a child eat something off of&nbsp; the floor. Um, acting out sexually. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; just spending time alone with a child. sometimes&nbsp; putting on uh plays and entertaining adults. And then what became apparent was the spiritual&nbsp; component, the satanic element to this. And&nbsp;&nbsp; I have they used to kind of argue who got to be&nbsp; uh I guess what is it? Glenda the good witch of&nbsp;&nbsp; the of the Wizard of Oz, right? Is it? And I&nbsp; mean they were fullon witches and they were&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about the name of their coven which&nbsp; they ended up calling it Sisters of Darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I remember the conversation about&nbsp; they liked the band Sisters of Mercy.&nbsp;&nbsp; So like how about Sisters of Darkness?&nbsp; But it was very clear that there were&nbsp;&nbsp; people above them that were teaching these&nbsp; principles that they got to have their own&nbsp;&nbsp; like backyard coven but that they were not the&nbsp; higher upper echelons of this and but they did&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of torturous things and I like I have one&nbsp; memory where I was in their yard playing and the this woman, Alice, one of the women, came over&nbsp; to me and said, \"We're going to play a game.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; And she strapped she put these like gravity&nbsp; boots on me of some some kind. Uh I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't even know what they were. and she picked&nbsp; me up by my feet and hung me off of something how&nbsp;&nbsp; I see it as it was like a a laundry tea that&nbsp; probably had like hooks and I was hung upside&nbsp;&nbsp; down and she said Jesus went through this and&nbsp; walked away and waited for me to get into a&nbsp;&nbsp; very panicked state and then came back over and I&nbsp; mean I was trying to get my head with, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; all the blood rushing to your head like that, it's&nbsp; really uncomfortable. And so I was trying to like&nbsp;&nbsp; bend my body up so I could get my head above&nbsp; my heart. And um and she came back and said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Are you scared? Are you panicked?\" And I was&nbsp; like, \"Yes, yes, please.\" Begging for them to&nbsp;&nbsp; get me down. And she just took a syringe off&nbsp; the back of my spine and took extracted blood,&nbsp;&nbsp; which I have come to understand that that's&nbsp; adrenalized blood. And I would watch these&nbsp;&nbsp; witches get high on it and talk about how amazing&nbsp; they felt. And they would say things like,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Wait till you've been, you know, I feel like&nbsp; I'm 18 again.\" And then like one of the others&nbsp;&nbsp; who was more experienced in it would would say,&nbsp; \"Wait till you've been on this for a month.\" And I remember them um keeping what I think were&nbsp; likely child parts from how I remember it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course, you know, when we come up with&nbsp; these memories, when they these surface, like&nbsp;&nbsp; we're like, are am I crazy? Um, but I remember a&nbsp; conversation of, \"How do we know that the blood&nbsp;&nbsp; isn't infected with AIDS?\" It was the '8s. Um,&nbsp; and they were like, \"Oh, Dr. So and so, like,&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess it was their network work doctor tests all&nbsp; the blood.\" Um, and they would I think they were&nbsp;&nbsp; eating like some kind of bone marrow. They also&nbsp; were while abusing children and myself, they were&nbsp;&nbsp; also training me and a select few of the kids,&nbsp; especially the ones they had the most access to.&nbsp;&nbsp; So yeah, I was like in training to be one&nbsp; of them in their and I was eventually then&nbsp;&nbsp; hazed into their coven and um that would be&nbsp; the day that they did the mock coffin burial which feels like one of my most extreme extreme&nbsp; extremely traumatic days. And so that was a long&nbsp;&nbsp; weekend where this babysitter, this main&nbsp; babysitter was was my parents were working&nbsp;&nbsp; and they were away. They used to do put on these&nbsp; like flea markets and antique shows and it was&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe a long weekend that they were leaving&nbsp; for work and this babysitter came to stay at my&nbsp;&nbsp; house which in my head I thought oh well she'll&nbsp; be she'll be more well behaved because it's my&nbsp;&nbsp; house and obviously that was not the case and&nbsp; she invited the coven over and there were some&nbsp;&nbsp; children there that I didn't know that were&nbsp; not a part of the normal play group and I've&nbsp;&nbsp; come to understand the term like expendable&nbsp; children and yeah and so there was this one&nbsp;&nbsp; boy Elijah and they he around my age and I was&nbsp; around age six and they had us play together.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were they were just um encouraging us to&nbsp; play and then they would throw out little terms&nbsp;&nbsp; like you guys are soulmates now, you guys&nbsp; are bonded. Um this is like your brother. And then they would flip the script the&nbsp; script. They they flipped the script on&nbsp;&nbsp; me and and they said, \"Now you can either watch us&nbsp;&nbsp; torture him to death or you can kill&nbsp; him and put him out of his misery.\" And I didn't like either of those&nbsp; choices. And they said, \"And if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp; comply with us. If you don't listen to what we&nbsp; tell you to do, we're going to kill your parents. And just a side note, I just want to say that&nbsp; during all these different abuse scenarios that&nbsp;&nbsp; happened, these people would use whatever worked&nbsp; in that moment. It was either sometimes it would&nbsp;&nbsp; be your family knows we're your real family,&nbsp; you know, like and because you're being abused,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're dissociating each and every um&nbsp; scenario. So, I did not like that option,&nbsp;&nbsp; but they actually started to physically abuse him&nbsp; in front of me. the men were doing this. There&nbsp;&nbsp; were men connected, one being uh one of my main&nbsp; perpetrators and they started to twist his like&nbsp;&nbsp; dislocate his arm and at a certain point he just&nbsp; screamed and said just get it over with to me. And what I remember was that we went down into&nbsp; the kitchen and got like a grapefruit and&nbsp;&nbsp; they placed an X on a grapefruit and they had&nbsp; me practice with a knife, like a stabbing. And I would say this is the most&nbsp; traumatic thing that that happened&nbsp;&nbsp; because it's the thing that&nbsp; shattered my soul the most. And this was when they had him lay down. They had a knife and they wrapped my hands around the knife&nbsp; and I actually couldn't do it. I was like, I can't&nbsp;&nbsp; even penetrate this. And they were even talking&nbsp; you have to penetrate the it's horrible to think,&nbsp;&nbsp; but you have to penetrate the like breast bone.&nbsp; I I didn't even have that strength. So they,&nbsp;&nbsp; how I'm remembering it is that two of the&nbsp; witches wrapped their hand around my hand&nbsp;&nbsp; and plunged the knife into this boy and I&nbsp; and there was blood and I screamed and was&nbsp;&nbsp; so like so fractured, so dissociated,&nbsp; screaming my head off and them saying,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Now you could be implicated. Now you could&nbsp; go to jail for this if you tell anyone.\" And I&nbsp;&nbsp; remember just screaming and crying and saying,&nbsp; \"You made me do it. You made me do this.\" and yeah, that was really soul shattering.&nbsp; And it was a part of an entire day of&nbsp;&nbsp; being hazed into the cult where they&nbsp; then did a ritual with they gave me,&nbsp;&nbsp; how I'm remembering it is like a tab. I believe&nbsp; it was a tab of LSD because I started to like trip&nbsp;&nbsp; out and they we picked an area in my yard that&nbsp; was already dug. It was like a mound that had&nbsp;&nbsp; it was sort of like a fresher construction site&nbsp; and they had brought in a childsized coffin. And because I was tripping, it's hard to&nbsp; know whether these were real trained&nbsp;&nbsp; snakes or not real. But they convinced&nbsp; me that I was in a coffin with snakes&nbsp;&nbsp; and insects and not to move or the&nbsp; snakes would bite. And they gave&nbsp;&nbsp; me some kind of a a mask that to me I&nbsp; affiliated with like a snorkel because, you know, well I affiliate it now with a snorkel.&nbsp; I used to go snorkeling in the Caribbean with my&nbsp;&nbsp; father and there was some kind of breathing device&nbsp; where I was able to breathe but I was enclosed in&nbsp;&nbsp; something and it was in the dirt that was apparent&nbsp; to me that there was a burying happening once they&nbsp;&nbsp; closed this and I was absolutely terrified. I&nbsp; was afraid that if I moved even like an inch&nbsp;&nbsp; that something was going to bite me. I was most&nbsp; afraid on an emotional level of that I would&nbsp;&nbsp; never make it out and that my parents would&nbsp; think that I ran away or was like kidnapped.&nbsp;&nbsp; So that was the biggest fear I would say was that&nbsp;&nbsp; they'll just never know what happened&nbsp; to me and the the heartbreak of that. And I would say that's when a lot of the LSD&nbsp; was kicking in and I was really able to connect on a deeper level spiritually and I heard&nbsp; a very low but firm feminine voice which&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm recognizing as what people call Gia like&nbsp; mother earth and or mother nature earth and&nbsp;&nbsp; she said even if you never make it out again&nbsp; I'll take you I'll take care of you and that's&nbsp;&nbsp; when I was able to just kind of like be in the&nbsp; moment and I started to shift my body a little&nbsp;&nbsp; and realized nothing was biting me and my&nbsp; consciousness elevated in that moment. So when the cult members pulled me out and I mean&nbsp; there was like I remember dirt in my mouth like&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember they were brushing me off. I had&nbsp; an actual vision of I guess I had seen Star&nbsp;&nbsp; Wars at that age and so I think it's R2-D2&nbsp; when he comes out of when he's in the desert.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got like a visual, you know, the mind will&nbsp; always give you these like visual pictures. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and they had water for me and they said, \"You&nbsp; passed, you made it. you're in you're in the&nbsp;&nbsp; in the group and I just remember thinking I&nbsp; don't want to be in this group. Um and but at&nbsp;&nbsp; the same time I knew that these people were this&nbsp; was like small potatoes like I had just elevated&nbsp;&nbsp; my consciousness in that experience above what&nbsp; was happening truly. And I remember then I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"What about what about Elijah?\" And they&nbsp; said, \"It was all a show. It was all all&nbsp;&nbsp; smoke and mirrors.\" Um, the blood wasn't real.&nbsp; It was pig's blood, which they use in movies.&nbsp;&nbsp; They said all of these things which&nbsp; could have also been a trick. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think these this is how these people operate&nbsp; as well to just confuse you. Um so that you don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know what is real and what isn't. But after that&nbsp; is when they married me to to to to the devil,&nbsp;&nbsp; to Satan, Lucifer, and they had us drink from&nbsp; these metal goblets, and they had us do like a it was like a mini aisle marriage. But to confuse&nbsp; my memories, they had another child that had been&nbsp;&nbsp; there walk down the aisle with me. They had me&nbsp; walk down with my stuffed an my favorite stuffed&nbsp;&nbsp; animal. And then they did the real like satanic&nbsp; ritual marriage. And why they do that is so that&nbsp;&nbsp; when your memories come up when you actually, you&nbsp; know, start to really like unravel this stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's so confusing because they took a&nbsp; memory and layered it three times. And yeah, and that's a lot of work just um going into&nbsp; therapy and starting to unravel these things and&nbsp;&nbsp; figuring fig figuring out what's real, what was&nbsp; imaginary, what was a threat that was projected&nbsp;&nbsp; onto you that you envisioned in fear that's&nbsp; not actually a memory of what happened. Those&nbsp;&nbsp; are things that, you know, I had to do a lot of&nbsp; work in in many years of therapy to decipher. And yeah, thank you for sharing that&nbsp; absolutely terrifying and horrific memory,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, three memories with us. I know&nbsp; that this stuff isn't easy to talk about.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that this is kind of your first&nbsp; time sharing it on a platform like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; um really very brave of you and very courageous.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that's such a pain point with&nbsp;&nbsp; this healing is survivors who grew up in unsafe&nbsp; environments like you reckoning with the fact that&nbsp;&nbsp; adults that should have been keeping them safe&nbsp; and that they thought were keeping them safe in&nbsp;&nbsp; their front personalities, you know, growing&nbsp; up um actually behind the scenes, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; perpetrating them and then also forcing these&nbsp; children from such a young age to perpetrate.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is such a pain point for survivors to&nbsp; to heal from their guilt of of harming a a human,&nbsp;&nbsp; an animal, a child. Um but unfortunately that is&nbsp; a massive part of the programming and it serves&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple levels in itself from keeping you loyal&nbsp; because they they threaten you and say, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; things like how you said if if you don't&nbsp; do this, we're going to harm this person.&nbsp;&nbsp; um we're going to harm the you know your family&nbsp; or we're going to harm the person that uh we're&nbsp;&nbsp; asking you to hurt worse than if you just do it.&nbsp; And then on the other end they you know they give&nbsp;&nbsp; you these different memories of actually having&nbsp; the experience and then they gaslight you with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; No, it wasn't real. You know, there's all these&nbsp; different levels of programming that create such&nbsp;&nbsp; a plethora of emotions of of anger, of confusion,&nbsp; of sadness, of just deep, you know, conflict. And&nbsp;&nbsp; it can create, you know, a lot of loyal parts,&nbsp; too. Um, which obviously dissociation, which I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; grateful that you talked about because that's&nbsp; obviously the the the means to an end of all of&nbsp;&nbsp; this is dissociation and creating identities that&nbsp; can, you know, hold these secrets in in different&nbsp;&nbsp; compartments. And, you know, when when they do&nbsp; these horrific things, you know, they're confident&nbsp;&nbsp; that you're not going to remember and that if you&nbsp; do, it's going to be so confusing. And I mean just&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to comprehend, you know, being six years&nbsp; old and being handed that decision, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; adults who were put in the same position if they&nbsp; were randomly, you know, let's just say kidnapped&nbsp;&nbsp; or taken somewhere and somebody said, \"Here's&nbsp; your choice. You can hurt this person in this&nbsp;&nbsp; way or we're going to hurt them this way and it's&nbsp; going to be even worse. You might as well just do&nbsp;&nbsp; it.\" You know, I don't know a single adult that&nbsp; that wouldn't just break and shatter. And so to&nbsp;&nbsp; think about these impossible choices that they&nbsp; put on little children to make and then make them&nbsp;&nbsp; feel guilty. They threaten them. Like you said,&nbsp; you're on drugs, so you're already, you know, sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of seeing the world in in a very different way.&nbsp; Um, you know, which which can be terrifying, too.&nbsp;&nbsp; um being on a a drug like LSD where it really&nbsp; distorts your reality to begin with, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and yes, I just it's amazing, you know, the work&nbsp; that you and others have done to make sense of all&nbsp;&nbsp; of this because I'm sure even sharing it with a&nbsp; therapist can be very vulnerable for many reasons,&nbsp;&nbsp; especially not knowing if either a they'll&nbsp; be traumatized and say, \"I can't work with&nbsp;&nbsp; this or if they won't believe you, you know,&nbsp; and and it takes such courage to actually talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about this and I'm grateful that you did because&nbsp; there's other survivors on the other side of the&nbsp;&nbsp; screen. There's people even if they didn't&nbsp; have something that extreme happen to them,&nbsp;&nbsp; we all carry guilt in some way and we look at it&nbsp; from one perspective that like I should have done&nbsp;&nbsp; something that's my fault, you know, and there's&nbsp; a lot more to things that that happen because of&nbsp;&nbsp; other people that make us carry guilt. And when&nbsp; we can take that guilt and make sense of it,&nbsp;&nbsp; take the shame off our own shoulders and sort of&nbsp; put it where it belongs, realize what what we did&nbsp;&nbsp; and were forced to do, but then also realize, like&nbsp; you said, you had adults that had their hands over&nbsp;&nbsp; yours. They had you practice. Like there was a lot&nbsp; that went into eventually forcing you to do this,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and being able to take that shame and&nbsp; say, \"Okay, this was real. I did experience this.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is horrible and I'm going to heal from this.&nbsp; You know, I'm going to go through it and I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; going to make sense of it and face it and heal&nbsp; it, but I'm not going to carry the shame. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; going to put it where it belongs on them and I'm&nbsp; going to realize that I was a a child. I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; have a choice and it was an impossible choice.&nbsp; If you would have said no or if you would have&nbsp;&nbsp; somehow like completely, you know, defied it,&nbsp; they still would have made you do it. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; they would have they would have restrained&nbsp; you and made you do it or they would have,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, made you watch a worse scenario that&nbsp; they did to scare you, you know. Yes. Same. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's it's literally like a catch 22, like&nbsp; no matter what you do, you know, and so,&nbsp;&nbsp; and they're right, you know, a lot of times the&nbsp; situation is worse if the child doesn't comply.&nbsp;&nbsp; And they do that for a reason, too. They want you&nbsp; to be like, \"All right, I'm just going to do this&nbsp;&nbsp; because I know what you're going to do is going&nbsp; to be worse.\" you know, and so that also creates a&nbsp;&nbsp; compliance in the child where it just breaks them&nbsp; down and they're like, there's no point in saying&nbsp;&nbsp; no because it's going to happen anyways. And you&nbsp; know, there's there's just so many different like&nbsp;&nbsp; layers and programming layers of programming that&nbsp; they put into this. And so I deeply appreciate you&nbsp;&nbsp; sharing cuz like I said, it's a it's a really&nbsp; really big struggle point in this community. It&nbsp;&nbsp; can be really hard to make sense of. But the more&nbsp; that we talk about these things, then we realize&nbsp;&nbsp; that we can take that shame gently off and put it&nbsp; where it belongs and then do the healing for the&nbsp;&nbsp; reckoning of what actually happened, you know,&nbsp; of being forced into an impossible situation,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and realizing that it wasn't your fault,&nbsp; but that it still was horrible. It still happened&nbsp;&nbsp; and that there healing that needs done, you&nbsp; know. So, thank you from the bottom of my&nbsp;&nbsp; heart for talking about these really hard things.&nbsp; Yes. Oh, thank you. Yes. And I want to say that&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean obviously why they use children is because&nbsp; children are pure and innocent and the closest to&nbsp;&nbsp; God. And these people who are beings of hatred and&nbsp; darkness like the lowest of the low consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; They they get off on corrupting someone that is&nbsp; closest to God. And I have thought a lot about&nbsp;&nbsp; what was their purpose, what were they really&nbsp; getting from this other than, you know, I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched adults take vows that they were&nbsp; going to get certain things from the devil.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um they were promised things by the the the&nbsp; leader of the coven you know different things.&nbsp;&nbsp; one woman who couldn't get pregnant, wanted to&nbsp; be, you know, wanted to have another baby and&nbsp;&nbsp; just wealth and, you know, but on this other level&nbsp; of like, have you heard about redemption through&nbsp;&nbsp; sin? Have you heard about that? I find that&nbsp; to be really interesting when you look at it from a higher perspective of, you know,&nbsp; these beings that are clearly suffering so&nbsp;&nbsp; much that they would do these horrific&nbsp; acts. Um they're some a lot of them I&nbsp;&nbsp; believe are trying to redeem themselves&nbsp; through it's called redemption through&nbsp;&nbsp; sin. They think that if they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up&nbsp; so bad that somehow like God will have&nbsp;&nbsp; mercy on their soul. It really doesn't&nbsp; even make sense. But they're serving on a level of um like duality. They're they're&nbsp; serving the darkest of the dark. And in a way&nbsp;&nbsp; they are cat they're catalysts. But it's&nbsp; it's like thinking that if you mess up so&nbsp;&nbsp; badly like to your parents like maybe they'll&nbsp; take pity on you and like take you back. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; these people are so rejected or have rejected&nbsp; life so much that they're that they cannot&nbsp;&nbsp; source their own power from original source&nbsp; light creator you know holy mother creator&nbsp;&nbsp; um the source of all that is they are they have to&nbsp; take it from other people that's what they think. Um, I don't know if that fully makes sense, but&nbsp; it's just something that that comes to me like&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes when I think about like what what is&nbsp; the purpose of that? And and obviously a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; it there's nuances, but you know there's levels of&nbsp; power also. Some of them are just enjoying getting&nbsp;&nbsp; power over others. Some of them are, you know,&nbsp; really deep into occultism and they're gaining,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, power on the on the dark side. They're&nbsp; like they're working in the dark side and they're&nbsp;&nbsp; they're they're gaining power that way, which is&nbsp; not real power because with all of this that has&nbsp;&nbsp; happened to me. I mean, I actually have always had&nbsp; an angelic counsel connection. And I've I've seen&nbsp;&nbsp; so much of the sort of the realms of existence&nbsp; and and of humanity and the angelic realms. And when you know to go on the dark side of&nbsp; everything, it only goes to a certain level.&nbsp;&nbsp; like it it the the light is so much higher. Um&nbsp; you it's like um there's a ceiling of pretty low&nbsp;&nbsp; ceiling of consciousness is what I'm saying.&nbsp; Even if you graduate to a seemingly very high&nbsp;&nbsp; level in these like you know occult practices&nbsp; that are that are sourced from darkness. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're so that's a really great analogy for that&nbsp; cuz it's it's again an impossible thing for people&nbsp;&nbsp; to contend with which also makes people gaslight&nbsp; their own ability to believe in this stuff because&nbsp;&nbsp; it's so backwards from how somebody who's not&nbsp; a psychopath is. You know, unless you're a&nbsp;&nbsp; psychopath, unless you're a Satan worshipper and&nbsp; somebody that is just they live for that power,&nbsp;&nbsp; or so they're trained to live for that power and&nbsp; conditioned and mind controlled to, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it can just seem so bizarre that there's people&nbsp; out there that are committing these crimes and&nbsp;&nbsp; then going to work the next day and they're just&nbsp; out there in society. And so I do get how people&nbsp;&nbsp; can just not be able to sit with it because it&nbsp; doesn't make sense. But at the same time, when&nbsp;&nbsp; we're looking at this, we do have to put on an&nbsp; impossible lens to look through of understanding&nbsp;&nbsp; psychopathy, of understanding narcissism, of&nbsp; understanding the complete and total domination of&nbsp;&nbsp; of your mind given up to, you know, other people.&nbsp; And then also to being so hungry for power and to&nbsp;&nbsp; having that be something that you're trained to&nbsp; just continue wanting and to do it all at all cost&nbsp;&nbsp; no matter what it is that you will do whatever&nbsp; it takes to get that power you know and then all&nbsp;&nbsp; the different layers under it the blackmailing&nbsp; that they do and you know dissociating you and&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean there's just so many different layers to&nbsp; it and I also appreciate too that you brought up&nbsp;&nbsp; why they use children you know and and you have&nbsp; some examples of this in your story where they&nbsp;&nbsp; know that children, especially children that they&nbsp; specifically breed or target that have different&nbsp;&nbsp; qualities that they're interested in, such as&nbsp; like how you said your bloodline has sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; heightened psychic abilities that run through&nbsp; it. And that's a big fascination for them for&nbsp;&nbsp; many reasons. But when we're looking at, you&nbsp; know, a ritualistic perspective, without their&nbsp;&nbsp; soul sort of being intact, without them having a&nbsp; connection, like you said, to the divine light,&nbsp;&nbsp; when they're shut off to that because they're&nbsp; vibrating on an opposite frequency, they can't&nbsp;&nbsp; connect to these beings that they want power from.&nbsp; And they have to use, like you said, a child, some&nbsp;&nbsp; something that is connected to it in order to have&nbsp; like that conduit. And so a lot of these children,&nbsp;&nbsp; they're grooming to to further enhance their&nbsp; psychic abilities, which your story exemplifies&nbsp;&nbsp; um you know, with with some of the things that&nbsp; you were recognized for. Um but you really see,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, how these dynamics make sense&nbsp; to these people because of who they are,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is different and pretty much opposite of&nbsp; how, you know, a person in normal society is. But&nbsp;&nbsp; that does make total sense what you're saying,&nbsp; you know, and maybe we could talk a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp; about that since we're sort of talking about the&nbsp; the satanic side, you know, a little bit about&nbsp;&nbsp; some of the ways that you were recognized and&nbsp; used for your own spiritual gifts that you have,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, which is kind of another sad point in&nbsp; this cuz a lot of you are born with these really&nbsp;&nbsp; extraordinary spiritual gifts, you know, and&nbsp; luckily a lot of you now that get out are using&nbsp;&nbsp; them the ways that God intended you to. But of&nbsp; course, these people, these psychopaths, they want&nbsp;&nbsp; to harness that for their own agendas and and use&nbsp; you as a conduit to use those gifts to help them,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, achieve power or to do evil or, you&nbsp; know, to help them with these very dark agendas.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, maybe you could touch on that a little bit&nbsp; with your story um and help bring some sense to&nbsp;&nbsp; it. Um but also sort of share because it this is&nbsp; kind of a big part too, the spiritual side of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, it really is. Um, well, I mean, as far back&nbsp; as I can remember, I was sensitive to spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first house we lived in was haunted. I&nbsp; remember watching spirits fly around me and&nbsp;&nbsp; when I was in the crib, you know, I was a seer&nbsp; always. and especially as a child which I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; see the spirits now but I I can more feel them&nbsp; and with um my connection with with Jesus with&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeshua and I can channel and and if I want&nbsp; to speak to other spirits I don't tend to&nbsp;&nbsp; I tend to stick with my original counsel which is&nbsp; angelic counsel and Yeshua um for safety reasons,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, but I always had that ability to to&nbsp; see the unseen world and to fly out of my body,&nbsp;&nbsp; which that would be up to up for debate whether&nbsp; I was taught to fly through the remote viewing&nbsp;&nbsp; uh programming that I received through&nbsp; Project Stargate. Um but yeah, I mean I I I was born on a date that has some heightened&nbsp; it has some celebrity names around it and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh even like one um yogic master uh is was born on&nbsp; that date. But my father was friends with this ma&nbsp;&nbsp; man named Howard and he worked with Ingo Swan&nbsp; who was head of the remote viewing department&nbsp;&nbsp; for the CIA remote viewing Ingo Swan and who&nbsp; also worked with um Russell Tar and Harold&nbsp;&nbsp; Hal Pudof is his name. And so those are people&nbsp; that I've met. When I look at photos of them,&nbsp;&nbsp; I I it's very familiar that I've worked with them.&nbsp; I remember working with them and I remember being&nbsp;&nbsp; trained by them. And you know they they would you&nbsp; know the what's explained to you as a child you&nbsp;&nbsp; know as um as an incentive to want to cooperate&nbsp; in certain ways even though they're going to force&nbsp;&nbsp; you to cooperate anyway. But like on the higher&nbsp; levels of that, you're told as a child like you're&nbsp;&nbsp; helping our government, you know, do things, get,&nbsp; you know, get rid of the bad people. It's like&nbsp;&nbsp; the you're helping be the hero. Um that's the&nbsp; programming with it. And so even when I wasn't and possibly even before I went&nbsp; to a safe house and that's hard&nbsp;&nbsp; to kind of chronologically like&nbsp; put on a timeline, but I remember um Howard would and these men that had a hand in&nbsp; my programming would talk to me about having a&nbsp;&nbsp; visual before going to sleep and then setting a&nbsp; target. And the visual would would be something&nbsp;&nbsp; that would help me to fly out of my body and then&nbsp; a landing spot to make sure that I could get back&nbsp;&nbsp; into my body. And so, you know, as a child, you&nbsp; pick something like a hot air balloon or a kite&nbsp;&nbsp; or an airplane. And I would choose the landing of&nbsp; my friend's bottom of his staircase. He just had a&nbsp;&nbsp; very cool house. And so, I picked the bottom of&nbsp; his stairs to land. And that's how I would give&nbsp;&nbsp; myself that focus of going back into my body&nbsp; after I would go out into essentially out into&nbsp;&nbsp; the ethers into the stars. And when they would&nbsp; pick a a practice target, you would your spirit&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially your consciousness is is viewing&nbsp; something from above um a and dropping in. So you&nbsp;&nbsp; you could be witnessing a conversation, you could&nbsp; be seeing um a building. It's um the way something&nbsp;&nbsp; is physically set up, a note, a conversation being&nbsp; had. But a lot of it obviously with a child was&nbsp;&nbsp; practice before you're likely doing the really&nbsp; serious uh like heavy heavy hitter heavy hitter&nbsp;&nbsp; work. But did that answer your question? Is that&nbsp; going in the That's absolutely yes. And and thank&nbsp;&nbsp; you for too for bringing up Stargate because&nbsp; the remote viewing part is very common with the&nbsp;&nbsp; MK Ultra circles as well and a gift that a lot of&nbsp; these children um seem to naturally have which to&nbsp;&nbsp; my understanding something like remote viewing&nbsp; and and all spiritual gifts. I think we all,&nbsp;&nbsp; no matter who you are, you have you can tap&nbsp; into them. But, you know, they they recognize&nbsp;&nbsp; that some of these children have the ability to&nbsp; do it better or more naturally. And so then they&nbsp;&nbsp; they continue to refine the child in it. Just&nbsp; like how another child might go to, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; soccer practice every day. with you. Instead of&nbsp; going to a soccer practice, they're training you&nbsp;&nbsp; on this and and you know, um, having you practice&nbsp; it and refine it for them to be able to use later&nbsp;&nbsp; on in your life whenever you're, you know, of&nbsp; course they're using it then, but they, like you&nbsp;&nbsp; said, they're training you whenever you're young&nbsp; to use you in a more serious manner as you get&nbsp;&nbsp; better at it through time. Yes. Yes. Exactly.&nbsp; And and there's, you know, with that obviously especially when you're in their in their&nbsp; direct care in like a safe house where&nbsp;&nbsp; the training is going really strong,&nbsp; there is so much pressure and torture&nbsp;&nbsp; um being which it which honestly I I mean, it's&nbsp; not necessary to do that. If you think about a&nbsp;&nbsp; child and how open a child is and and especially&nbsp; like a good naturatured a a a goodnatured child um&nbsp;&nbsp; like we listened. We didn't need to be, you know,&nbsp; electroshocked to participate in the exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the part to me that is just baffling. But&nbsp; it's obviously a big part of that is to make the&nbsp;&nbsp; child forget and to dissociate into specific&nbsp; fragments of personalities. And you know the the first memory that I have of being&nbsp; taken to a safe house, I actually remember&nbsp;&nbsp; my family being threatened and there were two&nbsp; men there and I don't know if they had a gun&nbsp;&nbsp; or said they had a gun, But I was essentially I&nbsp; remember my mother begging them not to take me&nbsp;&nbsp; and them giving her the choice of either we&nbsp; will take out your whole family or you will&nbsp;&nbsp; allow us access to your child. we won't hurt a&nbsp; hair on her head and we'll bring her back. And I was literally put in I was picked up with&nbsp; my legs dangling over this man's arms. I&nbsp;&nbsp; remember what he was wearing, like part of it at&nbsp; least. Um it was like a yellow like peak kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; um collared shirt like cotton shirt and a members&nbsp; only jacket. Um that used to trigger me when I&nbsp;&nbsp; would see that. Um, and and I was brought into&nbsp; this, how I remember it, as like an openseated black Cadillac with tinted&nbsp; windows and leather seats,&nbsp;&nbsp; open seating. And I just was put in the in the&nbsp; car. And I remember like crawling around the&nbsp;&nbsp; back and looking up. I'd never seen windows&nbsp; like that before. and one of the men saying,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"See, you can see out, but no one can see&nbsp; in.\" And we went on a very long drive,&nbsp;&nbsp; which I've kind of tracked it. It may have been&nbsp; a safe house in Pittsburgh. I'm not sure of all&nbsp;&nbsp; my locations. Um, and I don't know how many&nbsp; times I was brought into a safe house, but I was brought into a facility where there were other&nbsp; children like me and around my age and put into&nbsp;&nbsp; these exercise training rooms. And I remember like&nbsp; one of the one of the things that really stands&nbsp;&nbsp; out to me was a boy that they put me in front of&nbsp; and there was a um a female I guess I would call&nbsp;&nbsp; her like a psychologist or she was a trainer&nbsp; but it felt like she was like a therapist. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and she had like a gentle nature to her and she&nbsp; had me hold palm to palm with this boy and said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Now, no speaking. Let him show you his most&nbsp; impactful experience.\" And somehow I guess he&nbsp;&nbsp; would tell something to her and she would have&nbsp; note of what he was projecting to me. And I saw&nbsp;&nbsp; that this boy had had a single mother, that she&nbsp; would make him mac and cheese and chocolate milk.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I saw the carpeting in the house and that he&nbsp; used to have long hair. And that in this program&nbsp;&nbsp; he was brought into that his head had been&nbsp; shaved. And I remember just and he was really&nbsp;&nbsp; sad that all his hair was gone and he missed&nbsp; his mother. And I remember like just saying,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"You still look nice.\" And she was like, \"Yes,&nbsp; you can tell him that he looks nice.\" And so&nbsp;&nbsp; there were like there were moments where there was&nbsp; emotional encouragement and then utter emotional&nbsp;&nbsp; torture. You know, build a safe place in your&nbsp; mind and draw it out. And I would draw these like&nbsp;&nbsp; heaven landscapes with a Pegasus and then that&nbsp; therapist would leave and a man would come in and&nbsp;&nbsp; say there is no safe place. and I would be like&nbsp; tortured. So, it was a lot of things like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, there's one scenario where I was put&nbsp; into a mint green padded room and I mean&nbsp;&nbsp; padded floor to ceiling and I was starved and I&nbsp; don't know for how long but I was so hungry and&nbsp;&nbsp; I was aware that I was being watched from like an&nbsp; observational deck of sorts and there was also Alo&nbsp;&nbsp; one of those doors where it's a split door where&nbsp; someone can open to talk to you and some of the&nbsp;&nbsp; guards would sometimes like peek in and tease me&nbsp; and eat a pizza like in front of me and I would&nbsp;&nbsp; be begging to eat something. And at one point it&nbsp; was explained to me by one of the facilitators,&nbsp;&nbsp; we can't feed you. You need to be a&nbsp; clear channel for the session. Um, and I and they were watching me. I remember loud&nbsp; noises being played and I was throwing myself up&nbsp;&nbsp; against this padded wall and just like collapsing&nbsp; in utter just despair, frustration. Like I I I&nbsp;&nbsp; remember some kind again. I could be mixing&nbsp; memories with that one padded room incident, but&nbsp;&nbsp; for some reason my memories also show me a water&nbsp; boarding experience where I was like where my head&nbsp;&nbsp; just kept being like pushed into water as like a&nbsp; tor a form of torture. And at that those points,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, I feel like at high torture points, I really&nbsp; did connect with what I would what I would call&nbsp;&nbsp; God, like holy holy father energy. Like at one&nbsp; point I I saw him going through it with me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, so you know, and I had a lot of those angelic&nbsp; intervention moments. I have I I had a near-death&nbsp;&nbsp; during either that experience or at the safe house&nbsp; in that experience because they were doing so much&nbsp;&nbsp; um electroshock and things that were bringing&nbsp; me to near death. Um, and so I did have one&nbsp;&nbsp; experience where, and it I probably have&nbsp; more than this that I'm not even remembering,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the one that I really remember is um waking&nbsp; up on like heaven's floor essentially. And there&nbsp;&nbsp; were angelic beings standing over me and and I&nbsp; just said I don't want to go back there. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp; some like mystical things there where um like&nbsp; a pogo stick in heaven goes a lot higher than&nbsp;&nbsp; one on regular 3D earth. Um, I mean they they let&nbsp; me play like I was like riding the horses and the&nbsp;&nbsp; Pegasus and you know there's like that stuff is&nbsp; those are creatures of heaven and I was then taken&nbsp;&nbsp; to I believe there's different realms of heaven&nbsp; according to consciousness but um I was brought by&nbsp;&nbsp; these two angels to a gate where there was a being&nbsp; there and I was afraid to even like speak but it&nbsp;&nbsp; was saying let her speak and I said I don't want&nbsp; to go back and the answer I got was the choice&nbsp;&nbsp; is ultimately up to you but you would be missed&nbsp; back there there are many people who would miss&nbsp;&nbsp; you and there's a calling for you to fulfill like&nbsp; you wouldn't finish that. Um, and I just remember&nbsp;&nbsp; making that, you know, I was I've always been&nbsp; like one of those reluctant empaths like like&nbsp;&nbsp; uh I guess I have to go back kind of like you&nbsp; know, you know, you have to do the right thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I was told to um by this being at these like&nbsp; I I saw the pearly gates, you know, I was told&nbsp;&nbsp; show her around and then bring her back and the&nbsp; angels flew me into different realms. Um like what do you call them? I don't I'm for&nbsp; some reason at a loss for the word,&nbsp;&nbsp; but almost different etheric dimensions kind&nbsp; of. And then I was shown what I would call the&nbsp;&nbsp; realm of hell and I was flown through it and I&nbsp; actually got scared and they said, \"Don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp; like you're not condemned here.\" like they&nbsp; were showing me everything. And I saw this,&nbsp;&nbsp; it was like a circus, like a the darkest circus&nbsp; you could ever see. I saw all of these beings on so many levels just suffering and but there was&nbsp;&nbsp; like fire throwing and I mean&nbsp; it was like a really bad um what are they what is that festival called that&nbsp; like it was bizarre like a Burning Man type. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp; you. like a like a bad version of Burning Man.&nbsp; Like it was it was suffering souls and it was like everyone going through their own level of&nbsp; torment. It was condemned souls and it was&nbsp;&nbsp; also bizarre like I said like for the lost&nbsp; fire throwing and like just like a bizarre&nbsp;&nbsp; like a like weird like a David Lynch movie kind&nbsp; of stuff. Um, and yeah, I got scared and then&nbsp;&nbsp; they flew me out of there, but it was like a tour&nbsp; a tour of hell. And I believe it this this whole&nbsp;&nbsp; experience ended on a better note though, one of&nbsp; the higher realms. And then I just like was zipped&nbsp;&nbsp; back into my body. And I remember having like a&nbsp; renewed hope. It was an instantaneous renewed hope&nbsp;&nbsp; because obviously being tortured like that in a&nbsp; body that you can't get out of creates a a very&nbsp;&nbsp; visceral sense of hopelessness. So, but for some&nbsp; reason that whole experience gave me a new level&nbsp;&nbsp; of hope and I remember saying I I can do this.&nbsp; That's so profound. And it's so interesting too&nbsp;&nbsp; to hear like how spiritual you were from such&nbsp; a young age that you have these like really&nbsp;&nbsp; horrific things that are happening to you and&nbsp; your body's undergoing the most extreme stress,&nbsp;&nbsp; torture and trauma that a human could possibly be&nbsp; in right to the point like you said of pushing you&nbsp;&nbsp; to death or beyond you know and here you are able&nbsp; to tap whether it was through the LSD like how&nbsp;&nbsp; you were talking about um or just through your&nbsp; own consciousness. Yes. being able to like get&nbsp;&nbsp; yourself through what you were going through&nbsp; through leaving that moment and being able to&nbsp;&nbsp; climb sort of above where your consciousness was&nbsp; in that moment. It's really interesting hearing&nbsp;&nbsp; stories from you and others like that.&nbsp; You know, I feel like it's one thing to,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, have one of those experiences where, you&nbsp; know, somebody say drowns. You know, you hear of&nbsp;&nbsp; these stories sometimes where there's people that&nbsp; they do die for a moment and then they come back,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, or cardiac arrest. um people that have&nbsp; written about, you know, what's on the other side.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I also think that there's, you know, profound&nbsp; experiences that aren't talked about enough like&nbsp;&nbsp; on the brink of that, you know, before that&nbsp; actually happens, if it even does happen. Those&nbsp;&nbsp; moments going towards, you know, death or beyond,&nbsp; right before that, there's these really profound&nbsp;&nbsp; moments that people have with being able to, you&nbsp; know, sort of connect with something greater than&nbsp;&nbsp; them in order to hold on. And then how you, you&nbsp; know, your your body on in this physical plane&nbsp;&nbsp; that you and I are speaking in right now is being&nbsp; tortured to death. And here you are, you know, up&nbsp;&nbsp; in these heavenly realms making a decision to go&nbsp; back into your body. You know, that like brought&nbsp;&nbsp; me to tears hearing you say that, you know, a&nbsp; child again making these impossible decisions&nbsp;&nbsp; when you could have just been like, \"No, you know&nbsp; what? I've I didn't this is not the empathy that&nbsp;&nbsp; I signed up for. Like, I'm done.\" that you you&nbsp; have like no safety around you in the moment that&nbsp;&nbsp; you have to go back in and you're still saying&nbsp; people will miss me. I have an impact to make.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to go back and do it despite what I'm&nbsp; what I'm going back into. You know, just very&nbsp;&nbsp; very profound. Yes. Yes. Yeah. because we don't.&nbsp; So I I just want to say like once the once the&nbsp;&nbsp; body and the ego are involved in this like because&nbsp; we are infinite beings our souls like we're good&nbsp;&nbsp; we're covered like I truly believe that like if&nbsp; you lead a good life you have a good spirit um you know we are divinely protected but when&nbsp; you are being subjected to such levels of&nbsp;&nbsp; darkness and torture. Like it's very hard for&nbsp; the ego identity and body to to deal with that.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's like and I've had to do because and I don't&nbsp; necessarily promote doing a lot of shadow work but&nbsp;&nbsp; in my healing I've had to acknowledge that my ego&nbsp; was really prepped to be thick at a certain point&nbsp;&nbsp; because of what I went through that I just on&nbsp; that level felt like I needed these these other&nbsp;&nbsp; ways to protect myself. So my ego almost like it's&nbsp; like when you have too much coverage or protection&nbsp;&nbsp; it starts to hurt. Like that's what happened to&nbsp; me. um where I and I've had to really strip those&nbsp;&nbsp; layers to like bring me back into becoming an&nbsp; open vessel, being an open heart, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; connecting again to others like because that stuff&nbsp; really closes you down. It's very challenging to&nbsp;&nbsp; this physical experience. Yes, 100%. I couldn't&nbsp; agree more. And one thing uh before I forget&nbsp;&nbsp; that I wanted to ask you about some of the&nbsp; memories that you were just talking about. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; when you say safe house, is that like a literal&nbsp; safe house or is this sort of a a private for&nbsp;&nbsp; better luck of words like programming center&nbsp; that is just utilized for children like you?&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I call it a safe house just because that's&nbsp; was a term that someone said to me when I was&nbsp;&nbsp; processing a lot of these memories&nbsp; like that they're called safe houses,&nbsp;&nbsp; but and to me the safety is just for them to&nbsp; protect themselves like the perpetrators. Uh yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean it's government and I mean I don't I don't&nbsp; know like is it government and private? like it's&nbsp;&nbsp; for sure only highlevel access to these buildings.&nbsp; Um, yeah, they're facility. I mean, it was my word&nbsp;&nbsp; I was using for like a CIA facility and and like I&nbsp; was saying, I I was telling you before this about,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, likely a lot of your listeners&nbsp; know that the CIA all a lot of those files&nbsp;&nbsp; are out through the Freedom of Information Act,&nbsp; these MK Ultra files. And I found one of mine&nbsp;&nbsp; uh at least in a grouping where, you know,&nbsp; it talks about in 1984 25 psychic children&nbsp;&nbsp; were used in Project Stargate, you know, psychic&nbsp; testing um on these children. And I'm like, \"Yep,&nbsp;&nbsp; that was me. I'm one of them.\" I wish I could&nbsp; find some of the others, you know? I wish I could&nbsp;&nbsp; really talk to some of the people I was down there&nbsp; with. Those memories are spotty as far as who I&nbsp;&nbsp; was around. It's it's you know I would say most of&nbsp; what I remember are the direct programming torture&nbsp;&nbsp; sess you know sessions that were done and I think&nbsp; we were kept quite isolated for a lot of the time and now also to go along with that Stargate is&nbsp; obviously sort of an extension of gifted and&nbsp;&nbsp; talented programs sort of in the same realm. Kind&nbsp; of a government scouting program. One is a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit more severe than the other. A lot of times um&nbsp; there's different layers of gifted and talented as&nbsp;&nbsp; well, but you were actually put in those programs&nbsp; as well in school. Um could you remember about&nbsp;&nbsp; that and um were you taken off property or what&nbsp; was the gifted and talented program like for you?&nbsp;&nbsp; So not I don't not a lot like as far as like&nbsp; so yes I was in gifted and talented up until&nbsp;&nbsp; a certain point and then I feel I was taken out&nbsp; of it. I actually at a certain point from all of&nbsp;&nbsp; this abuse like I developed learning issues,&nbsp; disabilities um because I was dissociating so&nbsp;&nbsp; badly, I would just my I would be reading in&nbsp; a group and my brain would dissociate. I could&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes not even read the words. Um, and but&nbsp; yes, when so I changed schools three times before&nbsp;&nbsp; the age of eight and that's not counting the&nbsp; little bit of schooling I did in the Caribbean.&nbsp;&nbsp; That would be the school number four that I'm&nbsp; just like that was more just woven in and that&nbsp;&nbsp; was a very small group of kids and it was right on&nbsp; the beach and that was only like when my parents&nbsp;&nbsp; wanted their vacation for a month or two at a time&nbsp; and but first I was in a public school so kinder I&nbsp;&nbsp; think was one of the programs that was connected&nbsp; I don't know if you've looked into kinder&nbsp;&nbsp; And there's a lot of like known MK Ultra connected&nbsp; to that. That would have been like nursery school,&nbsp;&nbsp; kindergarten that was public. And then and&nbsp; like like a preschool. Then I was put I was&nbsp;&nbsp; in a public school where a lot of testing went&nbsp; on and I was in that like G&amp;T kind of thing. And&nbsp;&nbsp; I just remember really uncomfortable, strange&nbsp; testing going on and a lot of hearing tests up&nbsp;&nbsp; until I was nine. They would pull me out for those&nbsp; weird hearing tests with the beeping that are like&nbsp;&nbsp; so who knows what that fully was cuz I don't&nbsp; think it was just about testing your hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um but to me that's the least traumatizing of&nbsp; most of the things that happened. Um but but it's&nbsp;&nbsp; reinforcing you know um just in general public&nbsp; schools and I won't go too much off of off on this&nbsp;&nbsp; tangent but I believe all of us even the non like&nbsp; mainstream MK Ultra survivors like we were all&nbsp;&nbsp; traumatized by public schools municipal buildings&nbsp; with asbestous um like cleansing products that&nbsp;&nbsp; are just chemical and artificial like and just&nbsp; really unsaavory, you know, teaching tactics,&nbsp;&nbsp; insensitivity. Um but so yes at one school which&nbsp; was a school called Spring School which was public&nbsp;&nbsp; and that was my technically my kindergarten and my&nbsp; first grade. There was a lot of these weird tests,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of like testing my um like a lot of puzzles,&nbsp; a lot of like just oddly designed tests that I&nbsp;&nbsp; would be alone with one other facilitator doing&nbsp; these things to be placed. And then I spent 2&nbsp;&nbsp; years in a private school that I believe once&nbsp; I was really like in the program, once that was&nbsp;&nbsp; underway, they were paying for this. And there&nbsp; was a lot of talk about just my direction. Like&nbsp;&nbsp; it wasn't just teachers and my mom, you know,&nbsp; talking about, oh, she needs to learn more&nbsp;&nbsp; science. It was like two men that were had a hand&nbsp; in my education and the direction of it and would&nbsp;&nbsp; pull me out during this private school which was&nbsp; actually at a school school called Hampton Day&nbsp;&nbsp; School and we would go into the gymnasium which&nbsp; you know when it was not being used and they&nbsp;&nbsp; would do programming there and that's when there&nbsp; were also some Mason what I believe were Freemason&nbsp;&nbsp; um programming things going on as well. Like I&nbsp; just remember being told like do you want to be&nbsp;&nbsp; a brick in the house? Do you like prepare yourself&nbsp; to be built like a brick in the house? like they&nbsp;&nbsp; I was hazed into multiple like I remember talk&nbsp; of my main perpetrator him trying to convince my&nbsp;&nbsp; father that I would be that I should be a part of&nbsp; a rainbow girls program which is a Mason program.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's also connected to like the brownies&nbsp; and girl scouts and stuff. It's all that like&nbsp;&nbsp; extracurricular like let us guide your child to&nbsp; be a better citizen but it's programming. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; so I don't know if that answers your question.&nbsp; And also I don't have so many like G&amp;T memories,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I know that that's a part of it. And I had&nbsp; and I remember when I wasn't in it anymore. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; my one of my best friends like bragging that's&nbsp; why I'm in gifted and talented like you know&nbsp;&nbsp; like Yeah. It's interesting how these stories&nbsp; overlap so much and how many children who were&nbsp;&nbsp; in MK Ultra or related program Stargate were&nbsp; also coinciding with having this additional&nbsp;&nbsp; testing done in their regular day schools that&nbsp; they were going to on different levels. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; there were some stories I've heard where the&nbsp; the testing went into MK Ultra type experiments&nbsp;&nbsp; actually in the school program where other people&nbsp; had more experiences like you where those programs&nbsp;&nbsp; were maybe at a different facility where they&nbsp; would do the Stargate type remote viewing and&nbsp;&nbsp; then school was, you know, the the typical gate&nbsp; stuff, the headphones and the weird the weird&nbsp;&nbsp; uh scenarios that they'd have children&nbsp; figure out and and just like the the bizarre&nbsp;&nbsp; um kind of uh strategy games and things like that&nbsp; that they kids do. But it it's a commonality in&nbsp;&nbsp; this community that you know a lot of you for one&nbsp; have and were tested for high IQs and that you&nbsp;&nbsp; were put in those programs in one way or another.&nbsp; You know no matter what level it was a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; you you know were recognized even in school for&nbsp; having uh you know the high IQ and the propensity&nbsp;&nbsp; to you know maybe have psychic abilities and these&nbsp; different things that they were testing for there&nbsp;&nbsp; too. Yes. Yeah. And so what other locations&nbsp; were you taken to um for these experiments,&nbsp;&nbsp; for these, you know, abuses? Um I know Montalk&nbsp; is is near you. There's, you know, New York is&nbsp;&nbsp; it's kind of a hot spot whenever you there's not&nbsp; a ton of survivors out there talking about it,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it has been coming up more and more and&nbsp; and you realize that there is actually a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; to the state. So I'd be curious what else&nbsp; you could tell us about where you were at.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. So, so where I'm from is just&nbsp; about 25 minutes from Montalk. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; I do believe that I was at the base. I am not sure&nbsp; how often, but I believe I was brought there. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I had more locations to to give because a&nbsp; lot of my programming also feels as if it were in&nbsp;&nbsp; my bedroom, in my own bedroom, which there was one&nbsp; deprogrammer I worked with in my healing journey&nbsp;&nbsp; who said that if these people were invested&nbsp; enough in me, in programming me, They could&nbsp;&nbsp; have recreated my bedroom in a safe house or in&nbsp; a facility. So that you know what I'm saying as&nbsp;&nbsp; but also it is very possible because I of what the&nbsp; things my parents knew about and like I said when&nbsp;&nbsp; I say they knew I mean parts of them were sub knew&nbsp; about this um they I could have been programmed in&nbsp;&nbsp; in my bedroom um a lot And but as far as montalk&nbsp; goes, I really only have one memory of likely&nbsp;&nbsp; being there and that is there was so there's there&nbsp; are two men that have written a book the montalk&nbsp;&nbsp; Project Chronicles and I believe that I've met&nbsp; Preston Nicholls who's now deceased and they wrote&nbsp;&nbsp; all these things about what went on in in Montalk&nbsp; and were connected to this project Philadelphia&nbsp;&nbsp; and Ma project you know this is like Camp Hero is&nbsp; the is the military base location and what I just&nbsp;&nbsp; remember is holding ing his hand and walking&nbsp; through this sliding. It looked like a photo&nbsp;&nbsp; booth. How how when you go in not a photo like&nbsp; a if you're like developing film that's a photo&nbsp;&nbsp; booth, right? No, that's not a photo booth. It's&nbsp; like a um sorry like a a dark room a a photography&nbsp;&nbsp; dark room. It looked like something like that&nbsp; where you're walking through one of these doors&nbsp;&nbsp; that that you have to like rotate and it's just&nbsp; yeah completely dark. And I just remember walking&nbsp;&nbsp; through with him and me asking essentially I&nbsp; believe that we did a time travel because I just&nbsp;&nbsp; remember saying like what day is it? What time&nbsp; is it? And he's like we'll get we'll get us back&nbsp;&nbsp; to the current time. Like where we're going it&nbsp; doesn't matter. and it was like we walked through&nbsp;&nbsp; something and that's all I really remember about&nbsp; that. It is possible that one of the locations in&nbsp;&nbsp; fact that I was in the programming, you know, I'm&nbsp; I really thought um like I said, Pittsburgh and&nbsp;&nbsp; that was sort of off of an intuition of someone&nbsp; else who w is a deprogrammer, a friend of mine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um I I know that we like had driven a long&nbsp; distance but it is possible that I was programmed&nbsp;&nbsp; there as well in Montalk a lot. And one other&nbsp; thing that I did see in one of these facilities is&nbsp;&nbsp; what I call a government created alien. And it was&nbsp; like a robot that was made to look like an alien,&nbsp;&nbsp; like a mechanical alien. And they were all&nbsp; over. I don't know how else to to to say&nbsp;&nbsp; it. It's like a standard like gray alien, but it&nbsp; was like wheeling on the floor like a robot. And I just remember like trying to talk to one of&nbsp; like it once and one of the facilitators coming&nbsp;&nbsp; in and yelling at it to leave and I felt I felt&nbsp; sorry for it. I mean that's how sensitive I was&nbsp;&nbsp; as well. Like whether it was a real being or not I&nbsp; I believe it was mechanical. And I've heard other um I've at least heard one one or so other&nbsp; testimonies where where someone has mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp; like the government created aliens type of you&nbsp; know for whatever purpose that is. I don't know. Do you remember? Um, I know that&nbsp; it doesn't seem like that it was&nbsp;&nbsp; something that you witnessed and were sort&nbsp; of walking by. It wasn't something you were&nbsp;&nbsp; involved in. Did you see them doing anything&nbsp; or anything that any uses that you could see&nbsp;&nbsp; um the government creating&nbsp; these for and to utilize for just data collection. That is the only&nbsp; thing that I feel I witnessed was to keep&nbsp;&nbsp; track of the progress in the sessions. Um to&nbsp; record everything to like Yeah. Interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mhm. That's that's what I witnessed as the main&nbsp; purpose. Thank you for sharing that. that might&nbsp;&nbsp; jog somebody's memory or maybe other people&nbsp; have, you know, seen something similar. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; another piece of your puzzle that I want to make&nbsp; sure that we talk about to sort of create all the&nbsp;&nbsp; different layers that you were accessed from.&nbsp; Um, so you had a neighbor and had a child that&nbsp;&nbsp; was one of your best friends and yes, it might&nbsp; have been your actual best friend growing up. you&nbsp;&nbsp; could share about that, but maybe you could&nbsp; talk a little bit about that family as well&nbsp;&nbsp; because that had a big part as well in your&nbsp; perpetration and sort of where you headed to. So, I'm actually just having a sip of water. Sure,&nbsp; absolutely. Please stay off cuz you know this does&nbsp;&nbsp; it jogs a lot and it your brain starts to get&nbsp; like woo um you're jogging a lot of things loose. my best friend who since I was 2 years old, our&nbsp; parents met in a supermarket where her father&nbsp;&nbsp; came up to my mother and said, \"Oh, like I have a&nbsp; daughter about her age and that's how they became&nbsp;&nbsp; friends.\" Which of course makes me think that that&nbsp; could have even been a target. Who knows, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, but we became best friends. Um, like I even&nbsp; just remember the first time her coming over and&nbsp;&nbsp; um playing with me and the babysitter being left&nbsp; with us and we kept like opening the door. The cat&nbsp;&nbsp; was supposed to stay in a certain room and we kept&nbsp; opening it up like she kept putting a rubber band&nbsp;&nbsp; on the door to keep these French doors closed&nbsp; and we kept opening it and letting the cat in.&nbsp;&nbsp; and um and her family, she lived on&nbsp; at the highest point in Amaget. Um and her family lived next door to the Warner I mean the it was the family of&nbsp; Warner Brothers. If you look up if you look&nbsp;&nbsp; at who you know created Warner Brothers, it&nbsp; was the heir to the Warner Brothers and that&nbsp;&nbsp; family and we would get in her family would&nbsp; get invited to these sort of like suarees,&nbsp;&nbsp; tent parties, very fancy. They had&nbsp; a a large property and while I was&nbsp;&nbsp; at my friend's house having a we used&nbsp; to switch off sleepovers, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; different weekends and if I w was at their house,&nbsp; we went to these parties a few times and you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we would dress up. I would wear like a dress and&nbsp; tights and little like Mary Jane shoes and go and&nbsp;&nbsp; play with the other kids that were there. And&nbsp; the, you know, adults would be dressed up. And I mean, it was like not just like a tent that&nbsp; is um like a wedding party that has a a tent&nbsp;&nbsp; and there's grass inside. This was a tent&nbsp; that was decked out like internal, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; inside furniture. Fancy curtains like on the&nbsp; inside the velvet curtains that could be closed&nbsp;&nbsp; with like these luxurious rope ties, you know. Um,&nbsp; it it kind of look it started off like a normal&nbsp;&nbsp; party in a sense with a maybe like a a weird air&nbsp; around it. And then they would do something like light like um light flickering type of&nbsp; things. And there was a shift in energy&nbsp;&nbsp; and adults would put on these robes that really&nbsp; a lot of the robes looked I would say almost&nbsp;&nbsp; identical. I just remember like&nbsp; black sort of satiny silky robes and there would be teenage kids walking on like&nbsp; crawling on all fours serving on like a silver tray like orves&nbsp; on their back And us children would get masks put on our faces and so that&nbsp; we could not see who was doing what,&nbsp;&nbsp; but we were in the center of the circle. like&nbsp; we would they would have us line up. So we would&nbsp;&nbsp; be on the inner circle, the adults would be on&nbsp; the outer and it was like we were being passed&nbsp;&nbsp; around in these fetishes type of things. Um and I&nbsp; don't even have all of the memories of that. Um so whether there was a like any kind of penetration&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know but there w there&nbsp; is one thing that I did remember before that which was like a testing to see I&nbsp; won't get too into detail because it's just but&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially What they do is they can test&nbsp; a child with like an instrument to see to&nbsp;&nbsp; make sure that a child's not going to show&nbsp; signs of abuse or of penetration. It's like&nbsp;&nbsp; a it's like a gynecological tool. Um, and&nbsp; I mean these people are sophisticated and&nbsp;&nbsp; they understand it and whether it was filmed or&nbsp; not because there were celebrities there. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to go home and tell my mother like,&nbsp; \"Oh, Sy Sales was at this party.\" And um,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's possible I met Jimmy Savile, although he&nbsp; ran in a more like, you know, UK circle. Like,&nbsp;&nbsp; there was access to a lot of these people. And&nbsp; it is possible it was filmed as blackmail. Um, I don't know all of that, but I know that we were essentially like I remember pin the tail on the&nbsp; donkey being played except it wasn't a p it wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp; like the it was for fetish purposes like to to&nbsp; to engage like adults and children interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp; interacting and touching um foot things&nbsp; happening like yeah um inappropriate&nbsp;&nbsp; absolutely not appropriate one of their films&nbsp; is used in MK Ultra it's one of the most famous&nbsp;&nbsp; um programming tools their movie along with like&nbsp; Alice in Wonderland, which is another very famous&nbsp;&nbsp; programming tool. Their movie is that famous. Some&nbsp; of the that family knows they've had trauma. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; that part is one of the hardest things&nbsp; for a survivor is to not be validated,&nbsp;&nbsp; to only be given clues. Um, for example, the the&nbsp; I have been validated on certain levels by Ingo&nbsp;&nbsp; Swan's friend who was my father's friend. I mean,&nbsp; he straight up has admitted to me that he worked&nbsp;&nbsp; with Ingo Swan and I have that in a what's up&nbsp; conversation like spelt out, but he did not admit&nbsp;&nbsp; to like that level of perpetration. So because&nbsp; these people don't want to be implicated. So that part for a survivor is one of&nbsp; the most brutal things. If you rely on having your memories corroborated by another&nbsp; human, that part is really hard, you know. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; especially if they're still active in whatever&nbsp; cult or coven that they're involved in, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and some people don't get memories back very&nbsp; young, if at all, you know, and if they do,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's easy for these cults a lot of times to&nbsp; reprogram them. So they sort of forget all&nbsp;&nbsp; over again or just are so scattered that they,&nbsp; you know, they're not able to piece it together&nbsp;&nbsp; as eloquently as you have, which is really sad,&nbsp; you know, because then this ends up like really&nbsp;&nbsp; breaking up families and friends and causing&nbsp; so much dysfunction on so many levels, whether&nbsp;&nbsp; consciously or not. You know, the rift of memory&nbsp; and and how it can unfold into a dysfunction of&nbsp;&nbsp; its own. you know, remembering what a life was&nbsp; like and all of a sudden you're losing friends&nbsp;&nbsp; and family and and you know, people around you for&nbsp; your awareness. It's very bizarre and confusing,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and and it's ultimately sad. It's like&nbsp; I wish everybody in these in these systems could&nbsp;&nbsp; come out the other side like you and want to be on&nbsp; the survivor side versus still being victimized,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know? And unfortunately, so rare&nbsp; that that happens where people regain&nbsp;&nbsp; consciousness and memory integration and it&nbsp; really is a miracle. And it's it's crazy to&nbsp;&nbsp; hear just all these different situations like&nbsp; living so many lives in one life. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; you wake up one day or I should say one day you&nbsp; go to sleep and you're aware that you lived one&nbsp;&nbsp; life that maybe wasn't perfect but it also wasn't&nbsp; horrible. You wake up the next day and you realize&nbsp;&nbsp; you were living 10 lives at once and one seemed&nbsp; okay and the other ones were, you know, absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp; horrific and you were around all these people that&nbsp; you didn't really realize had a part in abuse, you know, it's just got to be really a lot to&nbsp; contend with. It is. And um at a certain point&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I was going to live in a mental&nbsp; hospital for the rest of my life because&nbsp;&nbsp; I just did not know how I was ever going to&nbsp; put all the fractured pieces back together.&nbsp;&nbsp; and and it it left me pretty hopeless for a&nbsp; like a large chunk of time where I was just&nbsp;&nbsp; very much in a dysfunctional depressed and&nbsp; passively suicidal um you know mentality. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um it it definitely was I mean I had to do so many&nbsp; things on my healing journey and um I mean I would&nbsp;&nbsp; say the spiritual part you know connecting to&nbsp; to Jesus to Yeshua to um my angelic counsel&nbsp;&nbsp; plant medicine helped me a plant called ibogga&nbsp; helped me a lot. I mean, there were multiple&nbsp;&nbsp; things that that helped and just like doing that&nbsp; work on like putting myself back together and um yeah, I wish for others. It's just one of the hardest things to do, but it&nbsp; is possible. And it's even possible when you've&nbsp;&nbsp; been shattered into a million pieces because and I&nbsp; I'm going to venture to say that because I wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp; that cooperative. I I we didn't even like quite&nbsp; get into all of that, but I sort of like failed&nbsp;&nbsp; out of some of that project Stargate. I mean,&nbsp; they just kept accessing me and well, if she's&nbsp;&nbsp; not going to do that, we're going to test this on&nbsp; her. Like, they really tried to shatter me. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it didn't work. I mean, it did, but it&nbsp; didn't. And uh because the spirit is stronger&nbsp;&nbsp; um and our connection to a divine plan is stronger&nbsp; if we can all be so lucky to remember ours, you know, and get those original memories back.&nbsp; Not just of the abuse but of the connection to the&nbsp;&nbsp; ultimate source. Yes. You know, absolutely. Yes.&nbsp; And your story really does span so much. And I&nbsp;&nbsp; know we kind of covered the the groundwork on it.&nbsp; Yeah. And I wanted to say my friend's family also&nbsp;&nbsp; was doing Luciferian practices and was possibly&nbsp; even connected because her father used to wear&nbsp;&nbsp; a robe in the house with a um it had an emblem&nbsp; of a wolf. Uh sorry, a sheep unmasking to reveal&nbsp;&nbsp; a wolf. A wolf in sheep's clothes essentially&nbsp; was their emblem. That is Fabian society which&nbsp;&nbsp; is directly connected to the UK and communism.&nbsp; It's a and they're a pro pedophilia group. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; connected to um Harriet Harmon is the woman. So&nbsp; I've had to just like I said be my own detective&nbsp;&nbsp; looking up these things and figuring it out.&nbsp; But like if you follow, if you have the courage,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and the will to follow these leads,&nbsp; you will find it and figure it out. Whether the&nbsp;&nbsp; perpetrators ever admit to anything or not,&nbsp; like you will come to know your own story. Yeah. Amen to that. And what a miracle it is&nbsp; that you and others have gotten to a place&nbsp;&nbsp; where you can be so integrated through a memory&nbsp; perspective to to understand it even if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know every little thing. Just to have the pieces&nbsp; that you can start putting together and even if&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a couple missing pieces to understand&nbsp; what you went through. It's it can really set&nbsp;&nbsp; you on a path to healing and help you know help&nbsp; you regain control over your nervous system and&nbsp;&nbsp; how all those things initially feel whenever&nbsp; you start remembering them which can be really&nbsp;&nbsp; horrifying. Mhm. Oh yeah. Yeah. It can be really&nbsp; really scary. And when I first started to remember&nbsp;&nbsp; I nearly lost it. And I remember I called this&nbsp; one author I forget her name. Ellen Lectar, I&nbsp;&nbsp; think it was. She wrote a book, right? End ritual&nbsp; abuse, right? I called her in 2013 and was like,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Oh my god, I've been through this.\" And at that&nbsp; point, no one was really talking about it except&nbsp;&nbsp; for maybe Kathy O'Brien or, you know, there was&nbsp; a couple. Yeah. And she did not stay on the phone&nbsp;&nbsp; very long with me. So, I didn't understand even&nbsp; what I had stumbled upon fully. I just She said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I can't stay on the phone with you very&nbsp; long.\" Like, I wanted her to be my therapist&nbsp;&nbsp; immediately cuz that's the work she used to do.&nbsp; And before she was writing her books and she said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I don't do this work with one-on-one survivors&nbsp; anymore.\" And I said, \"Oh, is it because it's&nbsp;&nbsp; too painful?\" She said, \"That's not why.\" and she&nbsp; she's like, \"I can't stay too long on the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp; but\" And she walked she said, \"Just know&nbsp; everyone around you likely is involved&nbsp;&nbsp; in some way in the in in in this.\" And she's&nbsp; like, \"You can do it. Like, you can do this.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; She kind of just gave me some encouragement,&nbsp; but I would It's utterly frightening. It is. And you have an incredible journey&nbsp; of healing and then on the other side of&nbsp;&nbsp; that becoming a healer. And I think it would be&nbsp; amazing to do a part two where we go into that&nbsp;&nbsp; part of your story. And you know, I'll obviously&nbsp; let if there's anything else that you wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp; cover today, we can talk about that. But one&nbsp; thing I really did want to talk about um maybe&nbsp;&nbsp; after we we close up, anything else that you&nbsp; wanted to share about those childhood years?&nbsp;&nbsp; You are a healer and I I want to spend a little&nbsp; bit of time sharing what it is that you do and&nbsp;&nbsp; how people can support you and ultimately hire&nbsp; you, you know, if your services are something&nbsp;&nbsp; that they're seeking right now because&nbsp; there isn't a ton of help out there. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, wanted to sort of pass that over to you&nbsp; if you wanted to talk about that or if there&nbsp;&nbsp; was some other things that you wanted to tie&nbsp; up with the other conversations that we had,&nbsp;&nbsp; feel free to go into it. Okay. Um, yeah, there&nbsp; was one other thing I did want to say. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection to what we were just speaking of.&nbsp; Uh, oh, I I just wanted to encourage like surviv&nbsp;&nbsp; survivors who are uncovering their memories and it&nbsp; feels like the neverending like Pandora's box. Um, and you do feel like you're being bombarded&nbsp; not just with the memories but possible&nbsp;&nbsp; gangstalking or like where you feel there&nbsp; are real threats still like happening. I&nbsp;&nbsp; think a big key in this is to keep your&nbsp; vibration as high as you possibly can.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because that and really connect whether you&nbsp; believe in God or not or higher divinity&nbsp;&nbsp; source like connecting to your highest light&nbsp; like it brings you up. It elevates you and it's like these these things can't touch you&nbsp; anymore. And I just wanted to put that out there&nbsp;&nbsp; because I know on top of uncovering things&nbsp; and working on healing, unraveling really,&nbsp;&nbsp; really painful things that you're reliving&nbsp; um on top of being bombarded say still by&nbsp;&nbsp; perpetrators or that energy or feeling it's&nbsp; like a double whammy. And so I think like a&nbsp;&nbsp; real key is spiritual nourishment, keeping your&nbsp; vibration really high. There's obviously so many&nbsp;&nbsp; layers to that as well. I love that spiritual&nbsp; nourishment. That's a really great way to word&nbsp;&nbsp; that. Yeah. Yeah. And I wish I knew I had&nbsp; known all of that then because my healing&nbsp;&nbsp; journey was really bumpy in a lot of ways,&nbsp; especially in the beginning. And now look&nbsp;&nbsp; at you now. You're speaking on podcasts. You're&nbsp; helping others through their own trauma. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; what a turnaround you've made since&nbsp; remembering and taking action on your&nbsp;&nbsp; healing. It's really amazing to see you on the&nbsp; other side of this now. Thank you. Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. Yeah. I feel much more at peace and&nbsp; I've done a lot of healing and integration and um you know you had asked what what I do.&nbsp; So what services I have I mean I I am involved&nbsp;&nbsp; in the arts. I have done um a film production and&nbsp; I am a painter and a musician. Um but my healing&nbsp;&nbsp; work and I love helping other survivors and I do&nbsp; help other survivors and non-s survivors of you&nbsp;&nbsp; know SRRA and MK Ultra. It can be you know life is&nbsp; traumatic. Um, I work with people and I do inner&nbsp;&nbsp; child deliverance with with Jesus with Yeshua. So&nbsp; essentially I I connect with him and and Jesus is&nbsp;&nbsp; and was an ascended being who graduated and he&nbsp; went through as we know like a slew of trauma.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I have been speaking with Jesus since I am a&nbsp; child. And he has manifested as plain as day in&nbsp;&nbsp; front of me and been speaking to me, wanting me to&nbsp; um spread his wisdom, which I've agreed to since&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a child. Um, and he has healed wounds on my&nbsp; on my skin. Um, like I cut myself once playing on&nbsp;&nbsp; my finger and he healed it. Um, he is a light&nbsp; worker, an ascended master being. And so what&nbsp;&nbsp; I like to do for other people is I like to relay&nbsp; messages. When people, you know, come to me with&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of their life situation, looking for certain&nbsp; guidance, I work with him for their guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't like to necessarily call it channeling&nbsp; because sometimes people affiliate that word,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, I'm a conduit of of him and my healing&nbsp; also is affiliated with and comes from him. It&nbsp;&nbsp; comes from the Holy Spirit and um that's what I&nbsp; do. So I work with people energetically through&nbsp;&nbsp; him and with messages from him and and I also&nbsp; you know there are it's it is up to us we&nbsp;&nbsp; can you know god can heal us instantaneously&nbsp; but because we're on this human path journey you know we want to do our own work too&nbsp; and So the inner child deliverance work,&nbsp;&nbsp; I really like that because the the child&nbsp; ego parts that got wounded can be healed&nbsp;&nbsp; with his guidance. And so I do that to heal the&nbsp; wounded parts with people, with clients. That's&nbsp;&nbsp; so beautiful. again. Look how cool that is that&nbsp; you know you were the one seeking help and now&nbsp;&nbsp; you're able to help other people through their own&nbsp; journey after all the healing that you did. Like&nbsp;&nbsp; what a cool gift to give to the world. I know&nbsp; that there there are a lot of survivors. I get&nbsp;&nbsp; emails pretty frequently from survivors looking&nbsp; for recommendations for healing, for therapy,&nbsp;&nbsp; um for people that can, you know, help deliver&nbsp; them. There's so many things that survivors need&nbsp;&nbsp; in their journey. If somebody heard what you just&nbsp; said and it resonates with them and they're like,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"That's exactly what I need. I really want to&nbsp; reach out to her. I want to work directly with&nbsp;&nbsp; a survivor. How can get in touch with you?\"&nbsp; Um, so I just set up a new like anonymous&nbsp;&nbsp; uh Instagram and that is uh let's see.&nbsp; I'm like, \"Okay, so we're Magnolia777 and they can DM me and then I&nbsp; I did set up an email with that&nbsp;&nbsp; as well and that is magnolia trinity@gmail.com. like my phone number can be provided as well&nbsp; through you if anyone reaches out directly to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could you could give my number to like say&nbsp; someone who is looking to you know work with like&nbsp;&nbsp; do this kind of work. And I also just want to say&nbsp; I have done multiple deliverances through other&nbsp;&nbsp; deliverance coaches. So, I am a clean vessel.&nbsp; Um, I've had exorcisms. I've had exorcisms with&nbsp;&nbsp; um interrogation, which is like crazy. Uh,&nbsp; I mean, you know, where each any part of you&nbsp;&nbsp; that is still like giving to a certain energy or&nbsp; entity is being like really pressed and and and&nbsp;&nbsp; brought into into line in line. Um, I don't work&nbsp; that harshly. I find that can get a little too&nbsp;&nbsp; cerebral. I really work with Holy Spirit. It's&nbsp; very gentle and loving and pure. Yeah. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; I definitely encourage people to reach out&nbsp; and support. Um, one of the easiest things&nbsp;&nbsp; if you're not seeking her guidance through a&nbsp; healing. Um, one of the easiest things that&nbsp;&nbsp; that the rest of you can do is go follow her&nbsp; on social media and just support her content,&nbsp;&nbsp; share it on your stories, connect with it, comment&nbsp; on it. You know, survivors often get really buried&nbsp;&nbsp; in the mix of the algorithm. And it's sad because&nbsp; other people speak over them who are not survivors&nbsp;&nbsp; and who are not helping survivors or even engaging&nbsp; with them or giving them credit. They're basically&nbsp;&nbsp; taking their information, profiting off of it, um,&nbsp; pretending that it's their own research, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and and then these survivors just get sort of&nbsp; tossed to the wind. Their information is being&nbsp;&nbsp; exploited again, you know, their experiences and&nbsp; uh, society continues to look away from them. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the easiest things that we can do as&nbsp; a society to support survivors is if they're&nbsp;&nbsp; on social media to just follow them. It's free,&nbsp; it's easy, and so is sharing their content. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; for the rest of you who who aren't going to&nbsp; contact her, or aren't looking for healing, I'll&nbsp;&nbsp; have her Instagram below and encourage you guys to&nbsp; just go support as an ally, as an advocate, as a&nbsp;&nbsp; support system. Um, help engage with her content,&nbsp; get it seen by more people. Um, and of course, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; share her links, her email, share her social media&nbsp; with any survivors you might know if you are also,&nbsp;&nbsp; uh, working with them or if you are&nbsp; somebody that connects with them online.&nbsp;&nbsp; and follows them. If you see somebody&nbsp; struggling who might need a helping hand,&nbsp;&nbsp; um you have another resource now. So, please&nbsp; help share her information to anybody who might&nbsp;&nbsp; be in need as well in your life. Um those things&nbsp; work absolute wonders to help support survivors&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's free. You know, it's a really easy thing&nbsp; that we can all collectively do together. Um and I&nbsp;&nbsp; really appreciate Magnolia all the work that you&nbsp; have done. Again, it's it's just so neat seeing&nbsp;&nbsp; you on the other side of here and impossible to&nbsp; imagine where you came from, knowing where you are&nbsp;&nbsp; right now. You know, it's it's like the darkest of&nbsp; the dark to the absolute brightest light. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp; amazing the journey that you've gone on. I feel&nbsp; like you're still just beginning and just getting&nbsp;&nbsp; started on it even though you've been going for&nbsp; so long, but you've learned so much, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and and over a decade of of healing and trying out&nbsp; different things. You know, what a resource you&nbsp;&nbsp; can be now to people who need guidance and advice&nbsp; through their hardest times. And you've gotten to&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of see a big evolution of this movement where&nbsp; even, you know, 2013 hardly anybody was talking&nbsp;&nbsp; about this stuff besides maybe Kathy O'Brien and&nbsp; a couple other survivors that you could find if&nbsp;&nbsp; you really dug. You know, now there's a lot more&nbsp; voices chiming in and you know, with all this with&nbsp;&nbsp; all this time under your belt that you've gotten&nbsp; to spend trying all these different things and&nbsp;&nbsp; learning and seeing the evolution. You know,&nbsp; it's great having you on the forefront now as a&nbsp;&nbsp; public speaker. you know, getting to share all of&nbsp; this with people and providing your puzzle piece&nbsp;&nbsp; now after you got so many puzzle pieces from&nbsp; other people who helped you along the way. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; congratulations on all levels. Thank you so much.&nbsp; I'm really going to I'm working on receiving like&nbsp;&nbsp; taking that in and like really just taking it in&nbsp; as a truth. You know, it's sometimes hard to be&nbsp;&nbsp; like, \"Wow, I really have done that.\" So, thank&nbsp; you. Um, you're so welcome. Yeah, thank you. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um, thank you so much for giving me the platform&nbsp; to share this and um, yeah, it's my honor. We all&nbsp;&nbsp; need to know this stuff and face it even if it's&nbsp; uncomfortable to listen to. And yes, and it's&nbsp;&nbsp; well, it has to stop. I mean, it it's this is not&nbsp; this is like a monstrous cycle on the planet that&nbsp;&nbsp; through awareness like it has to stop. These&nbsp; like like these bloodlines have to heal. This&nbsp;&nbsp; is not the way. This is not the way to go,&nbsp; you know. Absolutely. I couldn't agree more&nbsp;&nbsp; because that's I think when people initially&nbsp; hear of this, you know, their initial reaction&nbsp;&nbsp; is grab the pitchforks and let's just go kill&nbsp; them all off. And it's so much more complex&nbsp;&nbsp; than that. And because we don't know about trauma&nbsp; and the different types of ways trauma can affect&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody from turning them into a psychopath to&nbsp; making them a victim that they need freed from,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, making them a slave that they do not&nbsp; want to be. There's different levels of how we&nbsp;&nbsp; need to approach all of this. You know, ultimately&nbsp; we want everybody, like how I was saying earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp; to no matter what they've done, no matter how bad&nbsp; it was, we want everybody to come out and say,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"All right, I'm going to wipe my hands clean.&nbsp; I'm defecting from this. Enough is enough. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; breaking the cycle just like Magnolia did, just&nbsp; like Kathy O'Brien did. I want to be on that&nbsp;&nbsp; side.\" You know, you're going to also have the&nbsp; people who are they're unchangeable psychopaths.&nbsp;&nbsp; like they just don't have the capacity to heal,&nbsp; you know, even if even if we want them to. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; understanding these different levels of the&nbsp; types of of victimization that happens, the&nbsp;&nbsp; side effects of it, the fracturing and the damage&nbsp; that it does, and the different levels of damage,&nbsp;&nbsp; what can be healed from, what can't be. You know,&nbsp; it's so important that we understand this because&nbsp;&nbsp; that's going to be the key to stopping it is&nbsp; realizing how deeply embedded generationally&nbsp;&nbsp; it is and that it's not just a swift one and done.&nbsp; We just take everybody out and it stops. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; this goes back so many generations and it's it's&nbsp; still being perpetrated so many generations below&nbsp;&nbsp; us. And so having that understanding can really&nbsp; help us empathize where it needs empathized and&nbsp;&nbsp; accept with open arms the people who you know&nbsp; if they knew that they could be safe they they'd&nbsp;&nbsp; have arms to walk into that would accept them back&nbsp; into society and want them to heal just like how&nbsp;&nbsp; you know you have done and countless others. Um,&nbsp; and then also knowing where to throw the hammer&nbsp;&nbsp; of justice and to say, \"All right, if you're not,&nbsp; if you aren't going to take the initiative to want&nbsp;&nbsp; to heal and to come out of this and to stop what&nbsp; you're doing, then we have to figure out the right&nbsp;&nbsp; way to, you know, persecute and, you know, bring&nbsp; justice to those people um who have no intention&nbsp;&nbsp; of stopping, you So hearing all of this really&nbsp; helps us understand the different layers not just&nbsp;&nbsp; of how these stories and networks work, but the&nbsp; different layers of perpetration, victimization,&nbsp;&nbsp; and the side effects of that, you know, and how&nbsp; we can stop this if we take the time to actually&nbsp;&nbsp; understand trauma, you know, and how it affects&nbsp; society, how it affects the individual, how it&nbsp;&nbsp; affects a family, you know, and how powerful it is&nbsp; that people people take that initiative no matter&nbsp;&nbsp; what the risk is and and say Enough is enough&nbsp; just like what you did and have the courage to&nbsp;&nbsp; walk away from it. Yes. Yeah. I totally agree. And&nbsp; it's a it's an evolution of consciousness. Like I&nbsp;&nbsp; I just see it as I mean I can't help but see it&nbsp; as like the the cycles and waves of the planet.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm like, how many more generations is this going&nbsp; to go on before it is like exiled from the planet?&nbsp;&nbsp; Like this is like I just think the more exposure&nbsp; and less from a victim standpoint of Yeah. like&nbsp;&nbsp; let's go with the pitchforks like and more like&nbsp; bringing light and awareness and healing to this&nbsp;&nbsp; for it to make its way off the planet like so we&nbsp; can go back to the light and bring heaven on earth&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially which is like what I believe is&nbsp; the goal of being here we're We're supposed to&nbsp;&nbsp; unify back to the lightest of the light, like our&nbsp; divinity, and bring it here to this fallen world,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know. Amen to that. And with leaders like you&nbsp; who lead with love and compassion, but also know&nbsp;&nbsp; boundaries, how to put your foot down and where&nbsp; to execute um persecution, you know, and judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is, you know, this really is the way. And&nbsp; it's not just one or the other. Like we have to&nbsp;&nbsp; be in both um in both states of consciousness&nbsp; of understanding this as a whole, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and hearing these testimonies I think are the&nbsp; way that that happens. And so again, I just I&nbsp;&nbsp; commend you. You're brilliant. You're incredible.&nbsp; You're eloquent. I would have never guessed that&nbsp;&nbsp; this is like your first time coming on a platform&nbsp; like this and thinking about it because you're so&nbsp;&nbsp; versed and like you're you're amazing uh public&nbsp; speaker. Oh my goodness. Thank you. At first, I&nbsp;&nbsp; felt like there was a big blank and I was nervous&nbsp; at first, but thank you for saying that. You did&nbsp;&nbsp; wonderful and I'm really excited to have you&nbsp; back on and to dig into more parts of your story&nbsp;&nbsp; because we covered so much today. This is like&nbsp; a jam-packed episode, but Yes. Yes. So many more&nbsp;&nbsp; layers to your story, including I do. But I feel&nbsp; we covered really like all the groups, like a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of groundwork actually, 100%. And next time we can&nbsp; always go over and sort of polish it off anything&nbsp;&nbsp; that um we didn't include this time and uh move&nbsp; into different aspects of your story um on part&nbsp;&nbsp; two. So I'm really excited to have you back on and&nbsp; really appreciate you Magnolia coming on today and&nbsp;&nbsp; sharing with us and giving us your puzzle piece.&nbsp; Thank you so much, Emma. Thank you. Really,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're welcome. It's an honor. It's the least we&nbsp; can do is is listen to all of this after you had&nbsp;&nbsp; to endure and survive it. So, it's my great honor&nbsp; to be able to do this and I know other people on&nbsp;&nbsp; the other side of the screen feel the same way.&nbsp; And so, for everybody listening on the other side&nbsp;&nbsp; of the screen, I will have Magnolia's email below&nbsp; as well as her Instagram. Go support her if you're&nbsp;&nbsp; a survivor or not. And then, of course, if you&nbsp; are a survivor of any kind or somebody dealing&nbsp;&nbsp; with trauma or PTSD or just needing to sort of&nbsp; move forward in your healing, if you're stuck,&nbsp;&nbsp; um you have a resource. So, please reach out&nbsp; to her and see if um you know it's a good fit&nbsp;&nbsp; on both ends and if if what you're going through&nbsp; is something she can help you with. Um but please&nbsp;&nbsp; share her information as well with with with&nbsp; other wounded warriors who might be privy to,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, wanting somebody that can help them walk&nbsp; through their healing journey. And uh so I'll have&nbsp;&nbsp; all that below. And I really encourage you guys&nbsp; to help share and elevate her and to share this&nbsp;&nbsp; episode with people um that you think would find&nbsp; value and education and and ultimately just people&nbsp;&nbsp; curious about learning the the ins and outs of&nbsp; the world like we're curious about it. And I'll&nbsp;&nbsp; have all my information below as well. Follow me&nbsp; wherever you guys can. We couldn't do this without&nbsp;&nbsp; you you guys. Thank you so much for listening.&nbsp; God bless you all and we will see you next time.",

In bases 4,&nbsp;&nbsp; Casmolt expanded on Barry King's material,&nbsp; first released in bases 1 and two. King talked&nbsp;&nbsp; about generated life forms, horrendous&nbsp; mind and population control programs,&nbsp;&nbsp; mannequin and puppet master, all going on in&nbsp; Britain's Barkshire countryside at a base under&nbsp;&nbsp; the village of Peasmore. Casbolt highlighted&nbsp; even more horrific programs involving children,&nbsp;&nbsp; genetic experimentation, and further terrifying&nbsp; details. And even a base under parliament itself&nbsp;&nbsp; called CLC1. In bases two and four, a further&nbsp; witness, Matt Todd, gave us even more detail&nbsp;&nbsp; with the involvement of the US military in&nbsp; the abductions or myabs and how he killed four&nbsp;&nbsp; grays at a base where people's souls were kept in&nbsp; cages. Bases 7 gave a super soldier Dave Maro and&nbsp;&nbsp; his trauma-induced monarch programming. Selected&nbsp; at birth and trained to fight off planet. Perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp; M. Todd demonstrated radio signals coming from&nbsp; his many implants. The existence of some other&nbsp;&nbsp; form of dimensional reality and a war with super&nbsp; beings is implied. So now in bases 9, we present&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Prince aka James Casbolt. This time the SS&nbsp; comes into focus and the nightmare continues. That&nbsp;&nbsp; is if any of these claims can ever be proved with&nbsp; factual evidential data. James Casbold. [Music]&nbsp;&nbsp; James, we met in a previous persona as James on&nbsp; previous edition of u the basis. You've got a&nbsp;&nbsp; different persona now or you've got two different&nbsp; um ways you portray yourself to the public. Can&nbsp;&nbsp; you explain what the difference is or why you've&nbsp; changed or has there been a change? Michael Prince&nbsp;&nbsp; James Castle. It's just a simple matter of I'm&nbsp; using the name of my birth name Michael Prince.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a name I was given at birth by my biological&nbsp; mother. So, so where what's the story of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Casbold story? Um, that was a family I was adopted&nbsp; into the Casbolt family. Yeah. So um that was&nbsp;&nbsp; um 81. Yeah. I need to go back to the beginning&nbsp; when I was a baby. the origins of project Ibis. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; it was the name of the project I was um involved&nbsp; in uh or born into effectively um was named&nbsp;&nbsp; project Ibis and it was run by the NSA and MI6&nbsp; and um it was it was um tracking of 42 children&nbsp;&nbsp; from different countries and um all those children&nbsp; were brought to a facility in Canada in the Rocky&nbsp;&nbsp; Mountains um underneath a small town called Nelson&nbsp; and what what countries why were they selected?&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, according to the file information I've seen,&nbsp; they were se selected for cuz their DNA the&nbsp;&nbsp; um the NSA information I've seen um says&nbsp; that we have what they call blood prime which&nbsp;&nbsp; um it states anunnaki DNA. What is blood prime?&nbsp; What's what specifically are the differences? I&nbsp;&nbsp; think it's a type of alien DNA, human um alien&nbsp; hybrid. Is there any particular recess negative,&nbsp;&nbsp; positive or anything like that? Um I think it&nbsp; there's that the recess negative factor in it. I&nbsp;&nbsp; think the the only negative factor. Yeah. So that&nbsp; how are the ch children selected as such? I mean&nbsp;&nbsp; does that mean there's some means of selecting&nbsp; is it from different you know at birth other&nbsp;&nbsp; people's bloodline medical records I think the&nbsp; mothers were um selected and um the embryos were&nbsp;&nbsp; cloned embryos grown in a artificial environment&nbsp; um test tube babies and I think those from my&nbsp;&nbsp; understanding those um embryos were then implanted&nbsp; into specific women who gave birth And then at the&nbsp;&nbsp; time of birth, the children were transported to&nbsp; the um underground facility in Nelson in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of that facility was a Q552. Where's&nbsp; Nelson? Is it in Matoma or Winnipeg somewhere?&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a small town in the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; It's inh British Columbia in Canada. um that so we were all taken there at the time of birth.&nbsp; Some some from America, I think. Um there was some&nbsp;&nbsp; from South America obviously, some from the&nbsp; UK. Um I don't know who the other 42 children&nbsp;&nbsp; are. I've got a rough idea now. Why 42? I don't&nbsp; know. Is it just just that's what the sample was?&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no significance in it. I don't know.&nbsp; I'm sure there's significance in it somewhere,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I don't have that information. Many of the&nbsp; children were transported on private CIA jets,&nbsp;&nbsp; small small jets or just just like Leah jets.&nbsp; Yeah. And um transported there. Um so what's the&nbsp;&nbsp; program? What specifically is the purpose of it?&nbsp; There's a lot of effort being put into this then.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why? Um project IBIS is again the Nazi connection.&nbsp; The name comes from the um the Giza Intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp; Group underneath the Giza pyramids, the Nazi group&nbsp; in World War II. What Nazi group is this? Um it's&nbsp;&nbsp; known as the Giza Intelligence. The Nazi group.&nbsp; Which part of the Giza plateau were they involved&nbsp;&nbsp; with? I don't know. I just know they were um based&nbsp; underneath the Giza pyramids. It was a facility,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Nazis in World War II. And um the name&nbsp; connects to Thoth, the um the immortal,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Egyptian. His um some connection with an ibis&nbsp; bird would represent Thoth in Egypt. Now what are&nbsp;&nbsp; they were they trying to find in Egypt or what&nbsp; did they find in Egypt? I think they found some&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of life extension technology and this was&nbsp; effectively that this was a major part of the&nbsp;&nbsp; IBIS program was life extension regeneration.&nbsp; Is there is there some kind of chamber that you&nbsp;&nbsp; could mention or any any particular area? Yeah,&nbsp; there's the emerald chambers. The emerald the or&nbsp;&nbsp; the emerald rooms, but I think that is that's in&nbsp; more than one location. Um I'd rather not talk&nbsp;&nbsp; too much about the emerald rooms. I'd rather just&nbsp; focus um because it's such a complex subject. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; um is this to do with the storage of souls on&nbsp; the earth and the recreation on earth? This is&nbsp;&nbsp; very much physical um this is they at the um Q552&nbsp; we were being indoctrinated with Nazi principles&nbsp;&nbsp; um Germanic principles um were you indoctrinated&nbsp; by Nazis? Yeah, it was Nazi. It wasn't just Nazis&nbsp;&nbsp; there, but there was a big Nazi presence. Um, some&nbsp; of the philosophies were indoctrinated with there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, you see those philosophies in um, Germanic&nbsp; organizations to this day like the Odinist&nbsp;&nbsp; Fellowship in this country. Um, the philosophies&nbsp; are based around obviously the creation of an&nbsp;&nbsp; Uber man, a superman. But, um, they see life on&nbsp; Earth as a means to an end. They're not trying&nbsp;&nbsp; to get somewhere else. They're not trying to get&nbsp; to heaven or another planet. They want to become&nbsp;&nbsp; physically immortal in this body on this earth&nbsp; and stay here. Now um we're also indoctrinated&nbsp;&nbsp; with the the Germanic belief in um endless&nbsp; warfare. Um is that would be our reality once&nbsp;&nbsp; we stayed here physically. We um our reality would&nbsp; be endless warfare and there'd be periods of rest.&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to maybe reorganize the the logistics&nbsp; or um they talked about the thousand-year Reich,&nbsp;&nbsp; a thousand years of peace. Um which would be&nbsp; periods of rest in between the warfare and then it&nbsp;&nbsp; would just be a continuous cycle. And um that was&nbsp; effectively um how they had indoctrinated us to&nbsp;&nbsp; be assassins when we were older so we could keep&nbsp; functioning. If we were concerned about the next&nbsp;&nbsp; um hit and had anxiety about that we wouldn't&nbsp; be able to carry out and function. But if in our&nbsp;&nbsp; mindset if we believe that we were designed&nbsp; for endless warfare and it would never stop&nbsp;&nbsp; um we would just accept that and be able and be&nbsp; relaxed when we were involved in assassination.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now what kind of assassination or what kind of&nbsp; missions are we are we talking about here? Um this is in numerous countries. um many different&nbsp; ways. So it's it's um is it I mean we are we sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of going and doing a one two three bump somebody&nbsp; off or or just just that different types of of&nbsp;&nbsp; assassination? Um a lot of it was standard um&nbsp; gunplay. Um I mean that that came later on down&nbsp;&nbsp; the road obviously we were actually raised&nbsp; in this facility as babies. So from 1976 to&nbsp;&nbsp; 1979 we were raised in this base. Um the where&nbsp; it was in the mountains um it was underground&nbsp;&nbsp; but there was um it was above ground the main&nbsp; entrance. It was like an aircraft hanger and&nbsp;&nbsp; um what kind of general area are we talking&nbsp; about? What can you describe in it? It's in&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountains. It's um it's a very private&nbsp; location near Nelson. Just near Nelson in&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountains. Would there be a mountain&nbsp; name you could name? It's near I think it I'm not sure the mountain name. I know that&nbsp; there's a um a logging compound nearby and&nbsp;&nbsp; there's an old um access route near the logging&nbsp; compound that actually takes you to the base in&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountain and Nelson's a very small town. Um&nbsp; again the above ground um section of it was a&nbsp;&nbsp; aircraft hanger and um when we were first brought&nbsp; there as B is it a is it got a runway and landing&nbsp;&nbsp; place or um it's fenced off high fences and&nbsp; um it has yeah it has a runway in front of&nbsp;&nbsp; the aircraft hanger if you come in but the um the&nbsp; aircraft hanger sits or fenced around the runways&nbsp;&nbsp; here and the aircraft hangers here. Yeah, it's&nbsp; quite a big building. Um but as babies we were&nbsp;&nbsp; um we slept in the aircraft hanger often&nbsp; because um it was essentially a trauma&nbsp;&nbsp; center. So they wanted us to be exposed to the&nbsp; cold and there was um sets of cops in there.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is high up I mean a couple of thousand&nbsp; feet up high the Rocky Mountain very high. Um it's near B National Park right where um so they&nbsp; we were kind of being exposed to the elements&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially. We slept there um in the aircraft&nbsp; hang with the doors open and there was rows of&nbsp;&nbsp; CS and we were under 24-hour armed guard all&nbsp; at all times. So we couldn't be rescued from&nbsp;&nbsp; that facility because there were factions there&nbsp; that would rescue us at the first opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The people that like the parents or or the well&nbsp; special forces groups um people that guarded us&nbsp;&nbsp; were they wore um they wore black uniforms. um&nbsp; some and they wore black masks, but sometimes they&nbsp;&nbsp; wore the um ultramodern SS uniform, which what?&nbsp; It's um it's kind of like your standard SAS Black&nbsp;&nbsp; Ops uniform. Um it's black boots, black trousers,&nbsp; black top, but the um it has chest plates and&nbsp;&nbsp; there's leather around the arms and it has the&nbsp; um SS double rune. Yeah. The the SS symbol. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um so that's a modern uniform. When you're saying&nbsp; a modern uniform, you're talking about post World&nbsp;&nbsp; War II. Yeah. This is the the the modern SS&nbsp; uniform. So getting back to this SS uniform,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think what era are we talking about? '7s.&nbsp; This was 1976 and we were first taken there&nbsp;&nbsp; as babies. So that means that the that's the SS&nbsp; wearing those uniforms in Canada. So they must&nbsp;&nbsp; have authority to do so. um there was some kind of&nbsp; internal war going on in the military and in the&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence community. So is this this is um are&nbsp; you saying this is therefore a Nazi organization&nbsp;&nbsp; that's that's doing this? Um yeah. Yeah. So by by&nbsp; inference it means that the connections with AL499&nbsp;&nbsp; and the other places in the UK must be essentially&nbsp; under Nazi control or is that NSA control? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is it. You see, there's a big Nazi element&nbsp; within the NSA because this was a officially an&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA facility, the Q552 at Nelson. This was a NSA&nbsp; base officially, the Q552 facility at Nelson. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, there's a there's a major Nazi element within&nbsp; the NSA. So, that essentially is saying that the&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA is a Nazi organization and a survivor&nbsp; organization from World War II. Um, yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd say that's a fairly accurate statement. So, de&nbsp; facto World War II was won by the by the Nazis. I&nbsp;&nbsp; wouldn't say they won, but I wouldn't say they&nbsp; lost either. It survived. Survived. Yeah. In&nbsp;&nbsp; an underground fashion. If the NSA is essentially&nbsp; protecting the Nazis or the Nazis are running the&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA. Yeah. Is is that what you're you're saying?&nbsp; Um I'd say that the Nazis faction is running MI6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um just to go off topic slightly before I carry&nbsp; on about what happened at the AL um Q552. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; my main contact in MI6, um, he's a director of&nbsp; special operations, a man named Alfred Bonner. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; is this your current contact or was your contact?&nbsp; He's been my contact for years and he's my current&nbsp;&nbsp; contact. I've carried out many assassinations&nbsp; under his instructions. Um, so you're saying&nbsp;&nbsp; this publicly? Is this um he's not he's not&nbsp; publicly known but people can contact MI6 and&nbsp;&nbsp; ask to speak to director Bonner you can contact&nbsp; MI6 on the website the phone number and MI6 will&nbsp;&nbsp; admit they do have a director Bonner there so&nbsp; what is the function of of telling us about&nbsp;&nbsp; this now is are they inviting people to to ask&nbsp; those questions or do they want that information&nbsp;&nbsp; out they want this information out they want this&nbsp; information out um Alfred Bonner he's from Bavaria&nbsp;&nbsp; um in German effectively. He's um he you see him&nbsp; very interesting looking man. Um you your classic&nbsp;&nbsp; Aryan giant. The guy's 6'6. Um looks about&nbsp; 52. Huge guy. Yeah. Massive shoulders. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; very blonde hair going almost white now cuz he's&nbsp; getting a bit older. Um, wears your classic MIB&nbsp;&nbsp; outfit. The fedora hat. That's his style of dress.&nbsp; Where's the fedora hat, black suit, um, piercing&nbsp;&nbsp; blue eyes, has a scar down his left side. That's&nbsp; from the officer class from fighting. I'm not sure&nbsp;&nbsp; where he got the scar. Um, this guy amazing guy.&nbsp; It's a characteristic of German upper class used&nbsp;&nbsp; to have a a scar. That's interesting. From sword&nbsp; fighting. It's interesting you say that. I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; know that. Um, very interesting character. He um&nbsp; from Bavaria, close friends with Henry Kissinger&nbsp;&nbsp; or Henry Kisser also from Bavaria. He seems to&nbsp; have an amazing ability to stay young and healthy,&nbsp;&nbsp; relatively speaking. Um, Alfred Bonner was the&nbsp; director of uh, security at Dulce at the time&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Doulie rescue. And now there's been a book&nbsp; published by Pilington, I think it is. Um, I could&nbsp;&nbsp; start correcting saying the whole Dolce thing&nbsp; is a fraud. They've stuck bits on the mountain&nbsp;&nbsp; to make it look as if what's going on. No, Duly is&nbsp; real. Dolce is 100% there. So, I mean, why do you&nbsp;&nbsp; think there'd be elements within MI5 publishing&nbsp; books, saying this stuff's wrong and it's shadows&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's it's a it's a wrong? I'm not really&nbsp; interested in the whole recent book has been&nbsp;&nbsp; published. Um, you know, I'm not really interested&nbsp; in all that. It's I know it's Dulce is real. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; um it's a important place for the new world order.&nbsp; So, what's what's the function of Dulce? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; we've heard certain underground things that which&nbsp; were released in the late '7s. Is there anything&nbsp;&nbsp; new about it? Is it current? I don't I've got a&nbsp; friend um in the CIA works at Oakidge National&nbsp;&nbsp; Laboratories in Tennessee and he often works&nbsp; down at Dulce. Um I mean he sent me pictures&nbsp;&nbsp; of the first level got color photographs and&nbsp; it's not really the first level isn't high tech.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's kind of just a damp old base, you know, like&nbsp; sort of it's a bit run down the first level. Not&nbsp;&nbsp; what you'd expect to see at all. The old elevator&nbsp; shafts and things. Are you able to provide those&nbsp;&nbsp; pictures at all? Yeah, I can. I've um I think they&nbsp; were released on Project Avalon a couple of years&nbsp;&nbsp; back, right? I can show you those pictures. Um,&nbsp; you know, but when you go down the levels, it does&nbsp;&nbsp; get more advanced down there. It's a essentially&nbsp; um Have you been down to those levels or have you&nbsp;&nbsp; been shown them? Um there is connections with um&nbsp; IBS and Dulce Douli is essentially a um officially&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a psychiatry center. Um they when the um&nbsp; employees walk around the facility, there's&nbsp;&nbsp; certain sections with um people in like hospital&nbsp; rooms with um almost like prison rooms in a way,&nbsp;&nbsp; but not with bars, like um plastic windows,&nbsp; you know, thick plastic and uh you know, you&nbsp;&nbsp; have people there in hospital gowns and um sitting&nbsp; on their beds and it it the the briefing is that&nbsp;&nbsp; they're um incurably insane. pain and that they're&nbsp; doing high-risk um drug treatments on the insane&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's actually a top secret um psychiatry&nbsp; facility. That's what they're first told when&nbsp;&nbsp; they go in there. So uh and then they they never&nbsp; come out these people. Yeah. Um I think a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; them don't come out. There's um as you go the hall&nbsp; these particular hallways um at Dulce these rooms&nbsp;&nbsp; in um the corridor curved round and every kind&nbsp; of 12 rooms you have an operating theater. These&nbsp;&nbsp; people taken out as operating theaters there.&nbsp; And uh the Q552 facility in Canada in Nelson was&nbsp;&nbsp; um there was a lot of uh Nazi psychiatry um&nbsp; conditioning going on there. What sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; what are you talking about conditioning? Well,&nbsp; for instance um at the facility they were um it&nbsp;&nbsp; was essentially a trauma center. Now they did a&nbsp; lot of conditioning with us with wild animals and&nbsp;&nbsp; what they were doing there they they used um&nbsp; Canadian wolves, they used snakes, they used&nbsp;&nbsp; um cats, wild cats and tigers and things. Um they&nbsp; were giving us the attributes of wild animals. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; they were subjecting us to um um for when we were&nbsp; older um for all terrain warfare, jungle warfare,&nbsp;&nbsp; artic warfare. So we had the attributes of wild&nbsp; animals. How do you get the attribute of a wild&nbsp;&nbsp; animal? They used um they set up I think it was&nbsp; a second level down at the Q552. Um they set up a&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of pen um about 30 ft 30 ft wide. Um they set&nbsp; up a this pen they put the babies in the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp; um they put wild animals in the pen. They might&nbsp; put snakes in there or you know wolves. Only&nbsp;&nbsp; one type of animal at a time. They didn't&nbsp; mix the animals. It was always one type.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this um pen was very similar to a Skinner box&nbsp; they use in psychiatry. Skinner box. A Skinner&nbsp;&nbsp; box is um famous psychiatrist Skinner. I forget&nbsp; his first name. Um he would he designed this box&nbsp;&nbsp; and he they put babies in it and they put animals&nbsp; in with the babies and they were doing cognitive&nbsp;&nbsp; behavior test. See, now the babies would react to&nbsp; the animals and um they would in this partic this&nbsp;&nbsp; this particular device um they put us in there and&nbsp; they set up screens in the corners of the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh people's the people's faces would be put on&nbsp; the screens um enlarged and uh the faces would&nbsp;&nbsp; call us and get our attention. We'd look and the&nbsp; faces would start talking to us people and then&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the faces would look like they were um changing&nbsp; into uh half human, half whatever the animal was.&nbsp;&nbsp; So if it was a snake, if they were putting snakes&nbsp; in the pen, this the the person talking would&nbsp;&nbsp; um start talking to us and then his face would&nbsp; change into half human, half snake lizard and&nbsp;&nbsp; um they George Bush senior was the main um&nbsp; handler of that particular uh facility and um&nbsp;&nbsp; his face would often come on the screen and talk&nbsp; to us and He would do the very much the rep the&nbsp;&nbsp; reptile with the snakes. That would be his area.&nbsp; Was that something that was done on a recorded&nbsp;&nbsp; type of a level or was it he did it personally?&nbsp; He was on the screen. I'm not sure if he was that&nbsp;&nbsp; he was there sometimes physically but I mean the&nbsp; guy travels all around the world to all different&nbsp;&nbsp; bases. He's a major programmer so I don't know he&nbsp; could have been over the other side of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and he would come on and um Is this something&nbsp; that you experienced directly? This Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; I I saw him. He used to talk to us, talk to me.&nbsp; And u And what age were you when this happened?&nbsp;&nbsp; I was this was 76. I was a baby. Yeah. And this,&nbsp; you know, this carried on. I spent from 76 to 79&nbsp;&nbsp; there and grew up there. Um the uh Queen Mother&nbsp; as well, she was a programmer there. She would&nbsp;&nbsp; um her face would be flashed on the screen, but&nbsp; her specialtity was wolves. Whenever they put the&nbsp;&nbsp; walls in with us, um she would come on and she'd&nbsp; talk to us and um she would start to change into&nbsp;&nbsp; halfwoman, half wolf like face on the screen. Was&nbsp; this done by some kind of electronic video effect&nbsp;&nbsp; or I don't know. I don't know. Um, can you name&nbsp; any other animals associated with different other&nbsp;&nbsp; people? Um, the only ones I remember is um George&nbsp; Brcina with snakes and the queen mother with&nbsp;&nbsp; um wolves. It's the place was very dark. I'm still&nbsp; starting to it's difficult to remember everything&nbsp;&nbsp; that happened there. Still coming back in bits and&nbsp; pieces. Um, I remember being put in the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp; um toy the group of babies and um there were toys&nbsp; put in and um one of the babies um took a toy off&nbsp;&nbsp; another baby and the um the little baby turned&nbsp; around and hissed at the other child like a snake&nbsp;&nbsp; and his face sort of went like a snake. So we this&nbsp; was absorbed into them psychologically. Yeah. Into&nbsp;&nbsp; their psyche. Yeah. And with the DNA anyway that&nbsp; an anarchy DNA that the NSA were looking for. [Music] In part one, we heard how Michael&nbsp; Prince is the birth name for James Casbolt&nbsp;&nbsp; and how he was taken to a base in Canada near&nbsp; the small mountain town of Nelson in British&nbsp;&nbsp; Columbia for cyborg enhancement as mind control&nbsp; children selected by their specific blood types&nbsp;&nbsp; on how they were exposed to the open cold night&nbsp; in a large aircraft style hanger to sort out the&nbsp;&nbsp; men from the boys just as in ancient Sparta.&nbsp; then guarded by Nazi SS troops in modern tight&nbsp;&nbsp; uniforms in the late 1970s. Michael sent this&nbsp; scan of one of his security clearances. However,&nbsp;&nbsp; in earlier images he sent claiming to be at&nbsp; the Dulce base, this could be anywhere. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; if anyone really knows what these forms refer&nbsp; to, please contact melblue yonder.co.uk. What age were you when this happened? I was a This&nbsp; was 76. I was a baby. Yeah. And this, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; this carried on. I spent from 76 to 79 there and&nbsp; grew up there. Um the uh queen mother as well,&nbsp;&nbsp; she was a programmer there. She would um her&nbsp; face would be flashed on the screen, but her&nbsp;&nbsp; specialtity was wolves. whenever they put the&nbsp; walls in with us, um, she would come on and she'd&nbsp;&nbsp; talk to us and, um, she would start to change into&nbsp; half woman, half wolf like face on the screen. Was&nbsp;&nbsp; this done by some kind of electronic video effect&nbsp; or I don't know. I don't know. Um, can you name&nbsp;&nbsp; any other animals associated with different other&nbsp; people? Um, the only ones I remember is um George&nbsp;&nbsp; Brcina with snakes and the queen mother with um&nbsp; wolves. It's the place was very dark. I'm still&nbsp;&nbsp; starting to It's difficult to remember everything&nbsp; that happened there. It's still coming back in&nbsp;&nbsp; bits and pieces. Um, I remember being put in&nbsp; the pen and um toy this group of babies and&nbsp;&nbsp; um there were toys put in and um one of the&nbsp; babies um took a toy off another baby and the&nbsp;&nbsp; um the little baby turned around and hissed at the&nbsp; other child like a snake and his face sort of went&nbsp;&nbsp; like a snake. So weird that this was absorbed into&nbsp; them psychologically or Yeah. into their psyche.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. And with the DNA anyway, the Anunnaki DNA&nbsp; that the NSA were looking for. So explain to&nbsp;&nbsp; the Anunnaki are I mean there's lots of different&nbsp; versions or different things about the Anunnaki.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is this kind of Anunnaki or precisely&nbsp; that I mean that term's banded around a lot. Um our group was there were Germanic roots Aryan&nbsp; roots which I would say connects to al deon in&nbsp;&nbsp; the plleades. So I think anunnaki I think is a&nbsp; Sumerian word that just means visitors from the&nbsp;&nbsp; stars or something like that. So I think&nbsp; in our particular group our heritage was&nbsp;&nbsp; um I mean we discussed this before in the last&nbsp; interview I think um you know it goes back to&nbsp;&nbsp; France, Germany, Bavaria, Greece in the Middle&nbsp; East goes back and um does he do Egypt to Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; connections with Egypt? Yeah. The tribe of&nbsp; Dan and Kaish. Yeah, definitely. So that's&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a white race of a white Germanic well&nbsp; Aryan race. And I don't mean just blondhaired. So we were we were being um conditioned every&nbsp; day and um into what what function? Um assassins&nbsp;&nbsp; mainly. assassins. Um there was, you know, there&nbsp; psychic things, remote viewing and that, but it's&nbsp;&nbsp; mainly assassins. Um physical soldiers, this is&nbsp; why they wanted the all terrain attributes. Um so&nbsp;&nbsp; just basic soldiering, not basic soldiering, um&nbsp; specific operations such as um crash retrieval,&nbsp;&nbsp; hunting, um tracking, aliens, what kind of crash&nbsp; retrieval? um ships that were shot down from alien&nbsp;&nbsp; creatures. So, you were specifically dealing with&nbsp; the crashed retrieval of non-human craft. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; that came later. There was many of them um&nbsp; tracking um alien entities through jungle terrain,&nbsp;&nbsp; desert terrains, almost smelling them, almost&nbsp; picking up this scent like a even though to the&nbsp;&nbsp; average person made these aliens would appear&nbsp; human. Uh would you would you There was all&nbsp;&nbsp; different types. We trapped all different types.&nbsp; There was a wolf type of being a bipedal humanoid&nbsp;&nbsp; wolf that like a Bigfoot. We trapped those&nbsp; creatures. So we trapped those. Were they were&nbsp;&nbsp; they people indigenous to Earth or were they um&nbsp; were they walking like through the dimensional or&nbsp;&nbsp; No, these were physical creatures that physically&nbsp; traveled in ships. There was a landing zone in&nbsp;&nbsp; um there was an NSA facility on the island of&nbsp; Panang. dense um the looking glass facility,&nbsp;&nbsp; dense jungle coverage, um regular physical&nbsp; landing, the ships will come down there. Some&nbsp;&nbsp; of these wolf beings. Did you ever see the the&nbsp; ships or uh Yeah. Yeah, I saw the ships that came&nbsp;&nbsp; later in the early '8s. Um if I just can stick&nbsp; to this what happened in Canada and um so we're&nbsp;&nbsp; being conditioned there and um essentially&nbsp; being tortured. It was a trauma center. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, how did the conditioning function? What&nbsp; happened when you were conditioned? What was&nbsp;&nbsp; done? Um, well, they terrorize us. They'd um&nbsp; I remember um they'd the guards, these S SS um&nbsp;&nbsp; uniform guys would um they they brought a a huge&nbsp; snake into the um pen one day and I think this&nbsp;&nbsp; was some kind of anaconda from South America. You&nbsp; know, it took like three or four of them to carry&nbsp;&nbsp; it in. This was huge. They put that in and uh I&nbsp; remember a young young girl there was involved in&nbsp;&nbsp; the program in something about 18 years old and&nbsp; um they fed someone to the snake in front of us alive. Yeah. Yeah. It's difficult to for me&nbsp; to look at the memory and look at the person,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I know someone was in the same way that&nbsp; we'd feed their live rats to snakes. Yeah. Watch&nbsp;&nbsp; live mice. Yeah. Yeah. And was this what was the&nbsp; function of this? Um I think they break us down,&nbsp;&nbsp; terrorize us to control us. I saw a lot&nbsp; of that stuff. saw a lot of um people and&nbsp;&nbsp; um later on I saw a young girl thrown in a cage&nbsp; with a wolf and um like torn to pieces and that&nbsp;&nbsp; was that was in England later on. Um what&nbsp; part of England? Barkshire. Barkshire A499. it. We had to be under armed guard 24 hours&nbsp; a day at the Q552 um because it was um there&nbsp;&nbsp; was groups apparently that wanted to rescue us&nbsp; from that cuz it's not you know if you didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; know that did you find out later. Yeah. Um&nbsp; so they're not definitely not all powerful&nbsp;&nbsp; or anything like that. Definitely. It wasn't&nbsp; like a um impenetrable facility. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of these facilities aren't. You can get&nbsp; in them if you really want. Yeah. Um and boss&nbsp;&nbsp; people out if you really want. Um we were we got&nbsp; to 1979 now and we've been raised there for those&nbsp;&nbsp; years between 76 and 79. And um we were all um&nbsp; put in SUVs, convoy of them to be driven down&nbsp;&nbsp; to another base in America. Uh Dulce Dica. Yeah.&nbsp; Being driven transported down to there in a in a&nbsp;&nbsp; convoy. And um I remember we hadn't got that&nbsp; far out the base. I think we're still in the&nbsp;&nbsp; mountains and the helicopter seemed to come out&nbsp; of nowhere. um small small special forces group um came out and there was a shootout and um some&nbsp; of the guards shot the children. Some of the&nbsp;&nbsp; SS guards shot the children before they could be&nbsp; rescued. some of their children, but most of us&nbsp;&nbsp; were um rescued and we were brought to a building&nbsp; in Toronto, like a um just it was large building,&nbsp;&nbsp; a skyscraper. Yeah. We were brought there&nbsp; to an underground car park there and the&nbsp;&nbsp; top level of the facility was um near Young&nbsp; Street or I don't know where it was. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got I could try and find out, but I'm not&nbsp; exactly sure. But I know it was in Toronto and&nbsp;&nbsp; um we were mean Toronto or I don't I know the&nbsp; area that well. I just know it was um there was&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of skyscrapers there and this was uh one&nbsp; very tall building. Um we're in the top level of&nbsp;&nbsp; the building. you look out across the whole area&nbsp; in it and um how many of them were you were you&nbsp;&nbsp; um that when we got to the um building in&nbsp; Toronto and we we stayed there for a few&nbsp;&nbsp; weeks I remember sitting in a room we used to&nbsp; sit in classrooms together there um 15 20 of us&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah about that so the the group that rescued&nbsp; us were based around com 12 uh in Majestic What's COM 12? COM 12 is a group&nbsp; centered around US naval intelligence,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it's actually a majestic group. Um, the&nbsp; I'm I'm in contact with one of the men who&nbsp;&nbsp; rescued us in America in 79, but I can't say&nbsp; too much about him at the moment. Right. Um, again another Germanic character. We're seeing&nbsp; really that this Nazi control Germanic control&nbsp;&nbsp; is is very much in in control or are they&nbsp; tolerated within the organization? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's good there's good and bad in this faction.&nbsp; I mean, there's this there's a whole Germanic&nbsp;&nbsp; faction which um fighting against the people doing&nbsp; all this evil in the So what do what do we have&nbsp;&nbsp; that what are the two basic good guys bad guys&nbsp; okay that who are the bad guys so to speak and&nbsp;&nbsp; what is their aim and what's their function&nbsp; and what's the purpose of all I can't simply&nbsp;&nbsp; separate into two factions we don't um we we run&nbsp; on survival dynamics what I mean by that is we we&nbsp;&nbsp; it's about the survival of ourselves survivors&nbsp; of our families survival of the organization&nbsp;&nbsp; ations we work in in our race. Um that's how we&nbsp; can understand. We don't believe in good or bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ultimately the good and bad side is essentially&nbsp; you're surviving. It's us surviving but then it's&nbsp;&nbsp; not just us surviving. We work on all the survival&nbsp; dynamics. Whereas if um we if a person is abusing&nbsp;&nbsp; children they're working against the survival&nbsp; dynamics. They're our enemy. Right? So this is&nbsp;&nbsp; how we can operate. But we have to have lines and&nbsp; boundaries or else we we we won't know who's who&nbsp;&nbsp; and we won't feel righteous and justified to take&nbsp; military action which we do on a regular basis. We went through operations there. There were&nbsp; surgeons there and um what was the function&nbsp;&nbsp; of those because they um the surgeons cut&nbsp; us open and found um cybernetics inside us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um so they'd at the Q552 they'd slowly been&nbsp; um cybernating us through with surgery and um essentially creating a cyborg soldier. Now, um&nbsp; these the surgeons at the the um place in Toronto,&nbsp;&nbsp; they they cut us open and apparently they&nbsp; they were like, \"What a mess.\" You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is and they tried and they were thinking&nbsp; about trying to remove it. But then it it turned&nbsp;&nbsp; out that this um technology would integrated into&nbsp; us. It couldn't be removed. It was actually a&nbsp;&nbsp; natural part of our bodies. Now um this can is&nbsp; it detectable in any way? Um, I'm sure it is.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure it is. All right. So, are you saying that&nbsp; we could somehow if we booked the relevant place,&nbsp;&nbsp; we could check out your cyborgs? If you went&nbsp; to one of those scanners in the airports,&nbsp;&nbsp; would they see it? Um, you know, the new&nbsp; scanners. Yeah, that's interesting. Apparently,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, the bone is a type of metal that um I'm not&nbsp; a scientist, but it's something to do with being&nbsp;&nbsp; off the periodical chart. It's not a um a metal&nbsp; that's known to man, so it won't set off standard&nbsp;&nbsp; metal detectors. I've been told the closest um&nbsp; thing we can compare it to on this planet is&nbsp;&nbsp; is a mixture of gold and diamond. It's extremely&nbsp; hard. So I um So you don't know how that how that&nbsp;&nbsp; works technically. Um there's apparently&nbsp; that that's the the bone and then there's&nbsp;&nbsp; um a small layer of kind of mechanical armor built&nbsp; around that bone to reinforce it further. And um is it got a grown? Apparently that is put in by&nbsp; some uh it's nanotechnology. this all mechanical&nbsp;&nbsp; armor around the bone. The bone itself is&nbsp; apparently metal. This type of metal and&nbsp;&nbsp; um it's built in nanotechnology that&nbsp; is apparently they put some like worms&nbsp;&nbsp; or something in you metallic worms and&nbsp; they lay eggs something like that and&nbsp;&nbsp; it it builds it. Is there a process&nbsp; name there? there was any kind of I&nbsp;&nbsp; think it's connected to the pro name of the&nbsp; Osiris program um the Proteus program um right is there anywhere we could look that&nbsp;&nbsp; up is there any documentation we&nbsp; could look at that not really no um I mean I've got I've got information from&nbsp; NSA databases is but it's not documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So this stuff you could look up on the&nbsp; internet as such. This is this stuff's never&nbsp;&nbsp; been talked about again. They they they're slowly&nbsp; cybernating these soldiers. What's the program&nbsp;&nbsp; name involved with that or where is it happening?&nbsp; How's it happening in other facilities? He started&nbsp;&nbsp; um the umbrella project of Ibis with numerous&nbsp; projects in that umbrella including mannequin. Um so yeah they wanted to these surgeons wanted&nbsp; to remove it cuz they didn't understand it.&nbsp;&nbsp; So by removing it would it cause more damage&nbsp; so they have to leave it. This is stuff had&nbsp;&nbsp; integrated into us. So they actually classified a&nbsp; new life form. The scientists after that they they&nbsp;&nbsp; um classified us they they called it ascended we&nbsp; were ascended machine technology. Ascended machine&nbsp;&nbsp; machine technology um essentially a cyborg with a&nbsp; soul and they developed a new law um of robotics&nbsp;&nbsp; around us a new science around us. Does this&nbsp; develop onto the secret soldier program? Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; because they wanted to do things like they wanted&nbsp; to uh jump out of a plane without a parachute and&nbsp;&nbsp; land in the jungle in the sea or in the jungle,&nbsp; run 40 miles through the jungle and then um take&nbsp;&nbsp; out your target and be picked up. Are you able&nbsp; to develop anything more on on that story? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; this I mean this came later, all these operations.&nbsp; Um what do you mean by later in the 80s? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's so many. I mean, the operation in&nbsp; Malaysia, for instance, that was a jungle&nbsp;&nbsp; warfare operation. Which operation in Malaysia?&nbsp; In Malaysia on the island of Panang. This was um and on what grounds and what type of&nbsp; military action are you talking about? um the lethal action assassinations where we're&nbsp; having to take the fight to them. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp; who is them? Where would they be? Well, okay.&nbsp; You're going to you want you you want names?&nbsp;&nbsp; So you want something? Okay. We 2007 myself&nbsp; and another individual um drove up to London.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um we travel to South London. Um around&nbsp; the elephant and castle area. Now, um we a an SUV pulled up with um MI6 operatives&nbsp; in there. We were given a briefcase. Um the&nbsp;&nbsp; briefcase had the pistol that I've used for&nbsp; years um for assassinations, which is a 9 mm&nbsp;&nbsp; Smith and Wesson with a pearl handle and has a&nbsp; symbol of a black dragon on the handle. And I&nbsp;&nbsp; I call that gun Drago. And um we were given that&nbsp; briefcase with that um pistol. There were these um&nbsp;&nbsp; small devices in there cubes which um kind of&nbsp; artifact very old pieces of hardware. Um what&nbsp;&nbsp; do you mean by old? You talking about ancient&nbsp; technology? I think it's Egyptian connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe thousands of years maybe older. Very old.&nbsp; um what's like little puzzle boxes, small cubes,&nbsp;&nbsp; a bit like a Rubik's cube, bit of metal around&nbsp; the side and engravings and they're they're simply&nbsp;&nbsp; you you hold them in front of your certain energy&nbsp; centers and you can focus your brain waves through&nbsp;&nbsp; them. So yeah, if you have um so are you saying&nbsp; that the handles of the gum or the the crystals&nbsp;&nbsp; are have a signature to use so you can only&nbsp; use it? Yeah, that's right. The um Drago only&nbsp;&nbsp; I can use. I mean Dre Drago has alien technology&nbsp; incorporated into it has special types of bullets&nbsp;&nbsp; that have been So it's not it's an ordinary bang&nbsp; bang gun. No, it has um special type of bullets&nbsp;&nbsp; that have engravings on them on the bullets&nbsp; and a special type of metal because when you&nbsp;&nbsp; um So you are shooting a a different type of&nbsp; being. Um, if you not shooting an old person,&nbsp;&nbsp; if if you're going to shoot an enhanced soldier or&nbsp; intelligence operative, a Glock 17 is not going to&nbsp;&nbsp; do it. I mean, it's the the the the chest plates&nbsp; reinforced. The slug won't go through it or the&nbsp;&nbsp; um organs are protected. So, is the bullet&nbsp; essentially got a form of nanotechnology on&nbsp;&nbsp; it that breaks the structure of whatever&nbsp; it's hitting? I think so. And there's um there's some occult um aspect to this with the&nbsp; engravings on they're um apparently these bullets&nbsp;&nbsp; are blessed but it's something to do with the&nbsp; Vatican and they um this is brings a new meaning&nbsp;&nbsp; to the term Vatican assassin. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so&nbsp; is it designed to go through some kind of psychic&nbsp;&nbsp; shielding of some description? It's both. It's&nbsp; physical and the psychic sort of go right through&nbsp;&nbsp; some kind of thought based force field. Yeah,&nbsp; exactly. And that's where the engrave ends and the&nbsp;&nbsp; they're blessed by the Vatican. It's nice to know&nbsp; the Vatican are blessing us both other beings. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; so you would so that by definition are you saying&nbsp; that the reason why you guys have been modified&nbsp;&nbsp; bone into being is because these other enhanced&nbsp; beings are running around the place or land or&nbsp;&nbsp; alien or extradimensional beings or what? The&nbsp; these are the same terrestrial. No, these are&nbsp;&nbsp; the same human cyborgs. Um the same people&nbsp; who are raised in these bases. These are our&nbsp;&nbsp; counterparts. We're all the same team. So you're&nbsp; essentially these are our dark counterparts who&nbsp;&nbsp; we're waring against and that's because they've&nbsp; been programmed by them by these SS people. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; we've all been programmed by the SS people but we&nbsp; managed to bust out of it but you didn't. That's&nbsp;&nbsp; the difference. So they've had their programming&nbsp; fully enhanced to a certain level and then you've&nbsp;&nbsp; had your programming enhanced to to try to to to&nbsp; destroy these other people. Basically, it's an&nbsp;&nbsp; internal war. Yeah. And when we um the particular&nbsp; guy we assassinated on that night, his name was&nbsp;&nbsp; um was Dixon Ramy, not his real name, top um&nbsp; MI6 operative. I think we got Yeah, you wanted&nbsp;&nbsp; to know some of the details about this internal&nbsp; assassin war. Um Dixon Ramy, not his real name.&nbsp;&nbsp; um an MI6 mind control handler was my handler&nbsp; in the early '9s and um the handler of many&nbsp;&nbsp; prostitutes, many mind control prostitutes. Um&nbsp; he we we we arrived at his house in South London,&nbsp;&nbsp; myself and another man. And um I walked up the&nbsp; pathway, knocked on the door, a woman answered it,&nbsp;&nbsp; prostitute, MI6 prostitute he was living with&nbsp; at the time, and I used a cube to control her.&nbsp;&nbsp; And can you describe these cubes to the size of&nbsp; Rubik's cubes? Bit bigger than a Rubik's cube.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's quite big. But yeah, um you just hold it in&nbsp; front of your this energy center here. Just hold&nbsp;&nbsp; it. Simple. And then you just talk to them cuz&nbsp; they connect with a cranial implant. So you just&nbsp;&nbsp; say, \"Okay, let me in. Sit in the front room.&nbsp; Sit down on the sofa.\" Um he was in the Where&nbsp;&nbsp; do you store down? Well, I just you hel you hold&nbsp; it in front of you like that with two hands. See&nbsp;&nbsp; how that and it's just a matter of talking, giving&nbsp; commands and um yeah, sit on the sofa. Remy was in&nbsp;&nbsp; the toilet at the time. Um the cube had already&nbsp; started to make him submissive when I was in&nbsp;&nbsp; the house. So, he just came out the toilet in half&nbsp; trance. Anyway, I just told him to go upstairs and&nbsp;&nbsp; wait in the bedroom. and uh he just went upstairs&nbsp; and just sat on the bed and waited for me. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um he had a bar there in the front room, you&nbsp; know, uh and I got the woman to sit down. I got&nbsp;&nbsp; her to pour us a drink. We sat down and um I we&nbsp; were looking for pearls. When I say pearls, it's&nbsp;&nbsp; an NSA code name for a suitcase nuclear weapon. Um&nbsp; he'd stolen the suitcase nuke and um been careless&nbsp;&nbsp; or something. Well, that's what got him shot. And&nbsp; um you then shot him. So I interrogated the woman&nbsp;&nbsp; about the location. Turns out that this thing's on&nbsp; a boat, certain boat in a certain location. Once&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the location of the the pearl, the suitcase&nbsp; nuke is on the river ts. No, it's in an ocean on&nbsp;&nbsp; a boat on a yacht. I won't give the names of the&nbsp; place in the yacht. Um he I had a little radio.&nbsp;&nbsp; I called my associate in and we went upstairs and&nbsp; um he put a pillowcase over Amy's head and then I&nbsp;&nbsp; shot him in the face seven times with a with with&nbsp; your with the pistol. With the pistol with the&nbsp;&nbsp; special bullets. Yeah. Is that because he needed&nbsp; the special bullets? That was my MMO, Miles. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; several shots to the face um on many targets. That&nbsp; was Is that to to disable the brain functions if&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event of it being a manurion that could&nbsp; continue functioning with one shot to maybe the&nbsp;&nbsp; other part of the body? uh they don't want them&nbsp; to regenerate and also um they want to destroy the&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence of the um cranial implants. Yeah, they&nbsp; have to destroy them for the autopsy in case the&nbsp;&nbsp; autopsy went into hands that they can't control.&nbsp; What is your primary function now in in talking&nbsp;&nbsp; now? I'm still active. What's the main thing you&nbsp; want to get across then? What's your what's your&nbsp;&nbsp; um people need to know this what's happening. They&nbsp; need to give themselves a chance cuz things What&nbsp;&nbsp; do you mean by giving themselves a chance? Well,&nbsp; things are going to um speed up and increase or&nbsp;&nbsp; this this wall is underground now, but it's&nbsp; going to burst onto the surface. It's going&nbsp;&nbsp; to burst into the streets, which it already is,&nbsp; but that's going to Can you mention any suggest&nbsp;&nbsp; any indications that which would illustrate that?&nbsp; that's that things are bursting into the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um I I don't I won't give any examples now. Um but&nbsp; people know what I mean in the next few years and&nbsp;&nbsp; um I just want to give people a chance. I mean&nbsp; there are suggestions that uh we've been all been&nbsp;&nbsp; told that we've been programmed or led to believe&nbsp; that you know 2012 is happening. There's going to&nbsp;&nbsp; be catastrophic events. So there's a whole pile of&nbsp; major global catastrophic events being programmed&nbsp;&nbsp; by the so-called Illuminati to illustrate this is&nbsp; the end of the world and bang bang bang we're all&nbsp;&nbsp; going to die. You know the Japanese earthquake&nbsp; that's that happened recently. Is that a is that&nbsp;&nbsp; an example of that earthquake? Some people have&nbsp; suggested it was a you know it was triggered&nbsp;&nbsp; artificially or is that the kind of thing you're&nbsp; talking about? Well, I was um in Nightsbridge at&nbsp;&nbsp; the time. Um and I was contacted um was just&nbsp; around the corner from Buckingham Palace. I&nbsp;&nbsp; was staying at Nightsbridge Hotel and um I was&nbsp; contacted by MI6 the night before an official&nbsp;&nbsp; um MI6 email address and um I was told tomorrow&nbsp; it's going to be a terrorist attack and the guy&nbsp;&nbsp; who contacted me said we wish we could stop it.&nbsp; They called it a day of rage. And uh there were&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of YouTube susers saying there will be an&nbsp; earthquake in Japan on Friday. And there was an&nbsp;&nbsp; earthquake in Japan on Friday. And I I I replied&nbsp; back. I said to him, you know, it's it's another&nbsp;&nbsp; another terrorist event. What do you want me to&nbsp; do about it? And then the next day the the tsunami&nbsp;&nbsp; happened in Japan. So it's not it's not a case of&nbsp; all these disasters are coming. They're happening.&nbsp;&nbsp; that they made it happen. Um, yeah. I mean, I'm&nbsp; not going to talk about the tsunami because it was&nbsp;&nbsp; um there was a lot more in the tsunami. But&nbsp; what I'll say about that and then I'll leave&nbsp;&nbsp; it at that is people need to um research the the&nbsp; battle of the China Gates, Captain Mark Richards.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened there with the earthquake? What what&nbsp; that really was. The battle of the China battle of&nbsp;&nbsp; the China gates. When was that? When that was&nbsp; in the late '7s and then the earthquake there&nbsp;&nbsp; in China killed huge amount of people. That's&nbsp; that's all I'll say about that. I've given the&nbsp;&nbsp; name people can research that themselves.&nbsp; Captain Mark Richards. Joanne Richards. Yeah. The body can practically any wound can be&nbsp; generated. you're essentially indestructible. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; it can regenerate pretty much any wound. Get your&nbsp; arm blown off. They've got um multiple cloned body&nbsp;&nbsp; parts of you, cloned organs, cloned legs, cloned&nbsp; arms. I just reattach another arm. So, it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp; it doesn't grow back? No, it doesn't grow back.&nbsp; Uh, wounds can regenerate themselves. How quickly,&nbsp;&nbsp; matter of hours? Uh, in seconds sometimes. Yeah.&nbsp; And how is that done? Is that done with your own&nbsp;&nbsp; power of your mind or it is enhanced? It's a&nbsp; it's a kind of automatic process. So it's done&nbsp;&nbsp; by the healing processes of the body naturally.&nbsp; Yeah. It's almost a speeded up healing process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um but then if you suffer catastrophic wounds,&nbsp; you get your legs blown off in Afghanistan. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; the ship you to hospital, they would they would&nbsp; attach new legs. salt. Is that what the coma&nbsp;&nbsp; hospitals are about? I think that was the early&nbsp; experiments of that stuff, but they perfected it&nbsp;&nbsp; now. They don't need that. They only need body&nbsp; parts from other humans for for every enhanced&nbsp;&nbsp; soldier. They'll they'll have all these body parts&nbsp; on ice and cry. Are they grown up grown or do they&nbsp;&nbsp; keep whole versions of you around? Um, no. I&nbsp; mean, how did the practicalities of that work?&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I'm not a scientist or a geneticist,&nbsp; but I know that they take your DNA and then&nbsp;&nbsp; they build the arm and then they just&nbsp; keep it in cryo storage frozen. [Music]&nbsp;&nbsp; In part two, Prince described in 1979 how he&nbsp; survived the rescue of enhanced cyber children as&nbsp;&nbsp; they were in convoy from the Canadian Nelson base&nbsp; and then being taken to Toronto where an MI6 took&nbsp;&nbsp; charge. On actor service in 2007 at a location&nbsp; near the elephant and castle area in London,&nbsp;&nbsp; he described assassinating an enhanced soldier&nbsp; who had stolen a suitcased nuclear bomb or pearl&nbsp;&nbsp; and shooting him seven times in the head with his&nbsp; 9mm Smith and Wesson pistol to destroy the cyber&nbsp;&nbsp; enhancements in the victim's skull. He described&nbsp; how this was done using a strange small cube of&nbsp;&nbsp; ET or ancient origin which was able to control&nbsp; the victim. So for more claims and details back&nbsp;&nbsp; to Michael Prince in the Bases 9 interview 2011&nbsp; that was on the island of Paneang in Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um there's a NSA facility on the island there. Um&nbsp; it's a looking glass facility. What's a looking&nbsp;&nbsp; glass facility? They use looking glass technology&nbsp; there. Um piece of hardware mean project looking&nbsp;&nbsp; glass uh remote viewing thing or it's a it's a&nbsp; piece of hardware looking glass. It looks um I&nbsp;&nbsp; mean I got a photograph of it and is it the set&nbsp; of glass structures or it's almost like a gold&nbsp;&nbsp; colored metallic cannon with um coils on the back&nbsp; of it and they they run mercury through the coils&nbsp;&nbsp; and it opens up portals. So you can um look into&nbsp; different timelines with it on a video screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it uh human derived technology or um I don't I&nbsp; don't think so. No. Um I'd say it's alien derived.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not 100% sure right% sure where it comes&nbsp; from. Um I mean this particular event would um the I was taken there by my carer&nbsp; who I was delivered into her care&nbsp;&nbsp; from Toronto and taken back to London in 81. A mother figure uh like a carer. This was the&nbsp; the woman um I mentioned her name on the on the&nbsp;&nbsp; interview with Richard last night. Um Kate Casbol.&nbsp; Kate Casbol. Right. Okay. Which is where you get&nbsp;&nbsp; your personal James Cas. Yeah. Not my biological&nbsp; mother. Yeah. I mean, we've discussed this and I&nbsp;&nbsp; um there's connections with MI6 with her me. So,&nbsp; she'd uh she's essentially there to keep you happy&nbsp;&nbsp; and healthy and um in a sort of a normal way.&nbsp; Yeah, kind of. It was complicated. Um because&nbsp;&nbsp; there was like a foster mother or Yeah. But&nbsp; then um my her husband um her husband before 81,&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter Kaspar, he was the MI6 agent who was&nbsp; involved in the drug trafficking operations. I&nbsp;&nbsp; mean I've seen some of his file operate uh some of&nbsp; his file data from he's the guy who got killed. Is&nbsp;&nbsp; that right? He died in Doncaster prison in 2003.&nbsp; He was serving 6 months for um possession of false&nbsp;&nbsp; passports and this was in conjunction with his&nbsp; function in MI6. But they why did they let it go&nbsp;&nbsp; through or was it? Um was he operating freelance&nbsp; so to speak? He would sometimes operate freelance.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was he'd take drugs um from the shipments to&nbsp; sell on the side and you know it isn't a drug.&nbsp;&nbsp; So he he extended his brief. Yeah. He didn't like&nbsp; that. Yeah. And there was also um I I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp; that's the reason why he died. There was there's&nbsp; something going on that was dropped off in prison&nbsp;&nbsp; because people knew he was an agent. Now um I'm&nbsp; pretty sure he was bumped off. He was um his file&nbsp;&nbsp; data talks about him being involved in remote&nbsp; viewing programs for the NSA. A program called&nbsp;&nbsp; um All Bright and Clear. All Brighton All Brighton&nbsp; because it was based in Hove and Brighton. All&nbsp;&nbsp; right. And that there was an NSA remote viewing&nbsp; program run from Brighton. All Brighton clear it&nbsp;&nbsp; was called. I was given his um identification&nbsp; number for that program. So he is now MI6. My&nbsp;&nbsp; um the guy who raised me for a few years&nbsp; in Barkshire and Reading, Neil Petit. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; he was never married to Kate Casp. They were&nbsp; never married, but they were together for a&nbsp;&nbsp; number of name. Neil Petit. He worked just near&nbsp; Peasmore. Um Hermitage in Newbury. Yeah. Um they&nbsp;&nbsp; he was a director of an aluminium company there.&nbsp; A big major company. It was a warehouse called&nbsp;&nbsp; um Himets. It's called Service Metals. Now&nbsp; he had defense contracts with the MOD. Um he&nbsp;&nbsp; worked underground at RF Welfford. Um with Can you&nbsp; describe more about Wilford? Is it just deputy for&nbsp;&nbsp; a weapon story jour? I mean I'm not too sure&nbsp; about Welfford. I know he worked under there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um he worked underground Bosam down too. And uh&nbsp; there was there was some sinister aspects of the&nbsp;&nbsp; company. There was some kind of child pornography&nbsp; trade video trade going on in in within the&nbsp;&nbsp; company. Is that connected with the ritual child&nbsp; abuse trauma that I'd say that it's connected with&nbsp;&nbsp; um the the underground facilities. I um when I&nbsp; remember when I was a kid in Reading in Bshire,&nbsp;&nbsp; I found some videos underneath the uh his um&nbsp; dresser and it showed um I put it on, it showed&nbsp;&nbsp; um a group of men in the Masonic Hall dressed&nbsp; in Egyptian robes and they were um sexually&nbsp;&nbsp; abusing little girls. On that particular video,&nbsp; it was a child pornography thing cuz I mean I was&nbsp;&nbsp; being sexually abused by Neil regularly. um his he&nbsp; was multigenerational incest. His stepfather had&nbsp;&nbsp; um come out of a Japanese um concentration camp at&nbsp; the end of World War II. And when um he his name&nbsp;&nbsp; was Jim Merch. Now when he came back to Barkshire,&nbsp; he he started to straight away sexually abuse&nbsp;&nbsp; um Neil and his sister. And there was um there&nbsp; was satanic ritual elements where he kill the&nbsp;&nbsp; animals in front of them. Yeah. I remember Neil&nbsp; always cuz Neil was an alcoholic as well because&nbsp;&nbsp; of all this. And um he used to used to get drunk&nbsp; and sit sit me down. So he always tell me the same&nbsp;&nbsp; stories when he was drunk. used to always tell&nbsp; me about how when Jim took him and his sister&nbsp;&nbsp; down to garden and killed the rabbits in front&nbsp; of killed the pet rabbits in front of them and&nbsp;&nbsp; cut their throats and uh he always he he used to&nbsp; say to me, \"Oh, um do you know what a pedophile&nbsp;&nbsp; is?\" And I was young and he said, \"If I saw you&nbsp; in the pub and you told me you were a pedophile,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd punch you straight in the face.\" He used to&nbsp; say things out but then when he used to get drunk&nbsp;&nbsp; um go into blackout then he'd come in my room&nbsp; start sexually abusing me and I think it was a&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of veilance whereas he was acting out what&nbsp; was done to him in a really drunken state and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh you know I've been interviewed by C in Cornwall&nbsp; about this about the sexual abuse with Neil it's&nbsp;&nbsp; on record. He lives in Australia in New Zealand&nbsp; and uh when I saw him a few years back, he says,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Oh, you know, I got this old German guy lives&nbsp; next door to me and uh I think he's um a Nazi on&nbsp;&nbsp; the run and we we've got really close. He comes&nbsp; around all the time. He he pretends he's senile.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's not. So this whole And now he pretends he's&nbsp; senile. Yeah. But he's maybe is he working for the&nbsp;&nbsp; Nazis still? Well, it's just no coincidence.&nbsp; He's got a a an old Nazi next door to him. He&nbsp;&nbsp; pretends to be seen now, but he's not. Yeah. Okay.&nbsp; Just before I say that, I'd like to say I'm not&nbsp;&nbsp; biologically related to either of the families&nbsp; I just mentioned, the Caspar or the Pettits. Um, I was taken to Malaysia by Kate Casbolt um&nbsp; the island of Panang and uh straight away remember&nbsp;&nbsp; being um walking along a little road in the in&nbsp; the jungle there. There's a picture of me in the&nbsp;&nbsp; jungle at the time holding a snake in front of the&nbsp; temple. I was put on Project Analog and um I just&nbsp;&nbsp; remember being taken um off the road by an army&nbsp; jeep and driven down a windy road in a jungle to&nbsp;&nbsp; a facility, fence facility, went in and separated&nbsp; from Kate Casbolt. um taken underground in a lift&nbsp;&nbsp; and there was kind of some command center um there&nbsp; serious computer operators in their desks and&nbsp;&nbsp; um taken by a American military officer and&nbsp; shown um video footage. I think it was kind&nbsp;&nbsp; some kind of satellite video footage and um I'd&nbsp; honed him something to remote viewers too and it&nbsp;&nbsp; um showed a alien creature in the jungle um a type&nbsp; of um bipedal wolf almost like a small Bigfoot but&nbsp;&nbsp; wearing a like a almost a brown robe with with a&nbsp; belt around it with some kind of hardware around&nbsp;&nbsp; the belt and um it was a still camera shot or&nbsp; it I personally think it was um taken through&nbsp;&nbsp; the eyes of a remote viewer and it connect they&nbsp; were connected to satellite. I think it was a&nbsp;&nbsp; camera shot through. So you can directly you can&nbsp; directly photograph and record what people see&nbsp;&nbsp; either through through their by telepathically&nbsp; ruing in or by an implant or by an implant. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; all physical. And I think that this this was&nbsp; what the remote viewer saw just before he died&nbsp;&nbsp; because this creature, as far as I know, killed&nbsp; that remote viewer and that was the last thing&nbsp;&nbsp; he saw. How did they kill a remote viewer? Uh, I&nbsp; think he shot him with some kind of particle beam&nbsp;&nbsp; weapon cuz I saw these creatures operate those.&nbsp; So, I mean, the remote viewer is physically not&nbsp;&nbsp; where the being was. Now he's physically tracking&nbsp; the um being through the jungle and he's um I think he's seen him from a distance but when I&nbsp; say remote viewing he's like a camera he's zoomed&nbsp;&nbsp; into him from a long using his physical vision&nbsp; but using his remote viewing abilities to zoom&nbsp;&nbsp; in right and uh so when the other being shot him&nbsp; Yeah. Does he shoot the his presence as a remote&nbsp;&nbsp; viewer? Does he see like an orb or something?&nbsp; How does he see? No, he's physically there. The&nbsp;&nbsp; soldier's physically in the jungle tracking this&nbsp; creature through the jungle, but the creature's at&nbsp;&nbsp; a distance far away. So, the soldier has zoomed in&nbsp; with his vision, which is a type of remote view,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it's more physical because it's connected to&nbsp; satellite. But then, how is he shot if he's if&nbsp;&nbsp; he's so far away? because the creature on the&nbsp; still shot that I was showing on the screen,&nbsp;&nbsp; the creature turned around like that and&nbsp; was looked. So, from my understanding,&nbsp;&nbsp; the creature seeing him and then like a sniper&nbsp; shot him from long range these particle beam&nbsp;&nbsp; um devices that they use. So I was shown that&nbsp; and I was um the the creature growled at the&nbsp;&nbsp; same time and that was picked up the sound and&nbsp; uh below the still shot there was a sound wave&nbsp;&nbsp; of the growl and the metrophosis used the word&nbsp; gruff. I'm not exactly sure what that meant. A&nbsp;&nbsp; gruff uh gruff just gruff. Gr u ff gruff. And um&nbsp; they played the soundwave to me under the screen&nbsp;&nbsp; which was the growl and they played it to me once&nbsp; and then they said focus on it and they played&nbsp;&nbsp; it to me again and played it about three or four&nbsp; times and each time was picking up the um energy&nbsp;&nbsp; signature of the creature. What do you mean by&nbsp; the energy signature of the creature? Um, I was a lot of it was to do with the scent. It's picking&nbsp; up its scent, but on by hearing it, I could smell&nbsp;&nbsp; it. So that would help you track it. Yeah. And&nbsp; this where it comes into the condition and we&nbsp;&nbsp; went through with the animals back in Canada.&nbsp; So then bring us to where the event happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; So we were taken I was taken out again above&nbsp; ground put in a uh there was a two jeep convoy&nbsp;&nbsp; soldiers and it was a woman in the front and&nbsp; we were driven through the jungle um to it was&nbsp;&nbsp; like a path in the jungle basically and we got out&nbsp; and we tked through the jungle for hours. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; I was only a little kid. And um after a couple&nbsp; hours, we stopped for a rest in this clearing in&nbsp;&nbsp; the jungle. It's like almost like a little the&nbsp; pathway was turned into almost a crossroads,&nbsp;&nbsp; like one path come this way, one path there, like&nbsp; a crossroads. And um we'd just stop to have a&nbsp;&nbsp; drink and have a rest. And I'd pick something up&nbsp; in the trees. And um what do you mean by picked&nbsp;&nbsp; it up? don't smell it. But it's more than just&nbsp; smell. It's like you can you can see smells. Um I picked something up in the trees and um&nbsp; I mean I looked up and I saw it in the tree.&nbsp;&nbsp; It it we were supposed to be tracking it, but it&nbsp; had been following us. It already knew you were&nbsp;&nbsp; coming. Yeah. And it was there. It was in the&nbsp; tree. And I I shouted up to one of the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp; say, \"It's up there.\" And um and this is where the&nbsp; um the abilities of these soldiers comes in. This&nbsp;&nbsp; was this was the first time I saw the abilities&nbsp; of them. And this was later I would have the same&nbsp;&nbsp; abilities. Um the moment I I saw it and it knew&nbsp; that I'd seen it, it kind of went up like that&nbsp;&nbsp; and it um shot some beam out towards me. Um it was&nbsp; almost like um it it made the air like swish like&nbsp;&nbsp; a rotation like that. I just I just felt the swish&nbsp; like this rotation sort of coming towards me but&nbsp;&nbsp; it was like metallic but it glowed the air. No,&nbsp; the thing that it shot particle beam or whatever&nbsp;&nbsp; it was, you could feel it was so powerful you&nbsp; could feel the air moving to come towards you and&nbsp;&nbsp; it was swiveing as it came through. But it was so&nbsp; fast but my senses picked it up and just before it&nbsp;&nbsp; hit me, one of the soldiers somehow projected some&nbsp; force field around my body and um so this is a&nbsp;&nbsp; relatively slow No, it's very fast. This happened&nbsp; in a split second. I'm not sure. It's almost like&nbsp;&nbsp; time slows down and it all happened in a split&nbsp; second, but the soldier was able to project the&nbsp;&nbsp; force field around my body before it hit me. So&nbsp; he'd already projected this to you as soon as&nbsp;&nbsp; he said where it was. As soon as I clocked him,&nbsp; bang, he shot he fired in the tree. So this is a&nbsp;&nbsp; protection mechanism. Um the soldier projected a&nbsp; force around like an egg. It's almost like water&nbsp;&nbsp; and then boom. It didn't it didn't hurt me at all.&nbsp; him and um and then I it all happened so fast and&nbsp;&nbsp; then I seen another soldier. He he he's up in the&nbsp; standing here and he's up in the tree here on the&nbsp;&nbsp; left hand side. Seen another soldier like in a&nbsp; split second he's there like a cat. He's run to&nbsp;&nbsp; the tree and he's run he's scaled up the tree.&nbsp; He's run up the tree like a cat. Yeah. Um like&nbsp;&nbsp; an animal. you were actually run up this big high&nbsp; tree like a palm tree or some kind of leafy tree&nbsp;&nbsp; or was with with lots and branches or it had quite&nbsp; a thick um trunk enough. It was bigger than his&nbsp;&nbsp; body. Yeah. Maybe one and a half twice the size of&nbsp; his body and he just he's he's standing there. It&nbsp;&nbsp; wasn't a soldier that projected the force field.&nbsp; there was a different one standing behind him and&nbsp;&nbsp; he's there in a split second like a cat is at the&nbsp; base of the tree and like I say then he's running&nbsp;&nbsp; up the tree scaling up the tree like a cat and he&nbsp; gets to the top of the tree and he's like perched&nbsp;&nbsp; it on top of the tree in the branch. He's perched&nbsp; like like a bird or something like squatted on the&nbsp;&nbsp; branch like looking up and his back is um like&nbsp; expanded outwards. Um he's almost like pulled&nbsp;&nbsp; energy up like uh from his from his center and&nbsp; he's like boom and his back boom popped out popped&nbsp;&nbsp; out. His back the muscles in his back have popped&nbsp; out. Yeah. It's like bulging out his um top like&nbsp;&nbsp; um and he's perched in the tree and this thing&nbsp; has um this thing has either jumped um from this&nbsp;&nbsp; tree to the next tree or he's he's some sort of&nbsp; teleportation teleportated to the next tree to the&nbsp;&nbsp; next branch. He's gone woof just Yeah. But it's&nbsp; like he launched himself but then you don't see&nbsp;&nbsp; him flying through the air. He sort of launched&nbsp; himself off the bush and then the reappear. Um he does the same thing. He chases him into&nbsp; the next tree and he like sort of launches&nbsp;&nbsp; himself off the branch. But again, he sort of&nbsp; teleportation. He just appears in the next tree&nbsp;&nbsp; and then the the creatures like boom to the&nbsp; next tree. They're chasing each other through&nbsp;&nbsp; the trees. The the creature and this soldier.&nbsp; I mean it's amazing to watch. And after a while&nbsp;&nbsp; they obviously disappeared. You can't see them&nbsp; anymore. And um the one of the operators had a&nbsp;&nbsp; a type of laptop computer and um he he went this&nbsp; was like really he got it quickly next to me and&nbsp;&nbsp; he wanted me to tune in. And I shut my eyes&nbsp; and I could see a screen in my mind's eye and&nbsp;&nbsp; um I could see the um the creature. There's a&nbsp; red dot on the screen moving forward. Um so is&nbsp;&nbsp; he following the creature or is he following his&nbsp; compatriate following the creature? He the guy&nbsp;&nbsp; in the tree is chasing the creature through the&nbsp; tree. The red dot the actual creature. The red dot&nbsp;&nbsp; is the creature. This is some kind of satellite&nbsp; remote viewing thing link up. And the the um what&nbsp;&nbsp; the the the red dot in my mind's eye is like a map&nbsp; is the creature moving in a certain direction. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um the the the soldier following him is a green&nbsp; dot following him in the same direction. and uh&nbsp;&nbsp; on the screen on the laptop with the soldier next&nbsp; to me. What I'm seeing um the picture the map is&nbsp;&nbsp; on the the screen. So he's trekking it and he's&nbsp; reporting back to the base. Were there more red&nbsp;&nbsp; dots? Yeah. Well, this is it. The other soldiers&nbsp; that were with us started running after them on&nbsp;&nbsp; the ground with their guns. They obviously&nbsp; they didn't have the ability to do all this&nbsp;&nbsp; tree climbing thing. They run through and I&nbsp; saw them as a series of green dots as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; um be following behind the first soldier, not&nbsp; as fast. In other words, he had backup. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; they were going through and um and then I saw&nbsp; another dot moving in a bigger one. Um I think&nbsp;&nbsp; this was a purple dot, a bigger one. And I&nbsp; said to the operating, I said, \"He's calling&nbsp;&nbsp; in his ship.\" So he's calling in his ship. And&nbsp; um in other words, one of ours, one of our No,&nbsp;&nbsp; he the creature was calling in the ship to&nbsp; escape cuz he was being pursued. And um the the operator got on the radio and um&nbsp; said um uh something about air support,&nbsp;&nbsp; calling in air support. Few must have only&nbsp; been maybe 30 seconds or a minute later.&nbsp;&nbsp; um two huge TR3 type of um aircraft, black&nbsp; triangles, come really low over the trees. The&nbsp;&nbsp; whole ground was like rumbling. Come really&nbsp; low over the trees. Um I saw there I could&nbsp;&nbsp; physically see them over the trees. They followed&nbsp; the direction of the the firefight and then after&nbsp;&nbsp; they disappeared from view and um and then I heard&nbsp; um some kind of missiles being fired. I heard shot&nbsp;&nbsp; uh weapons fired. Weapons being fired, but air air&nbsp; weapons. And um I and the ground was rumbling when&nbsp;&nbsp; these missiles were being fired. And um and then&nbsp; that was it. It disappeared. And then the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp; eventually came back. They said, \"He's got away.&nbsp; The creature got away. He got to his He got to&nbsp;&nbsp; his got to his ship and got away.\" And that caused&nbsp; us major problems. What's the reason why? Because&nbsp;&nbsp; this creature was involved in our lives when we&nbsp; were adults. It wasn't isn't coincidence. We were&nbsp;&nbsp; connected to this creature. This creature turned&nbsp; up at Peasmore. This creature turned up at other&nbsp;&nbsp; bases. And um is that the kind of creature that&nbsp; Barry King described? This was a wolf. This was&nbsp;&nbsp; a bipedal wolf like a small Bigfoot. um where&nbsp; uh with a cut type of brown robe. You're not&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about something very tall. Yeah, tall&nbsp; by like a man, but like a wolf, like a big foot&nbsp;&nbsp; um 6T, something like that. And he very similar&nbsp; to the um flying humanoids. The footage you see&nbsp;&nbsp; in South America, it was kind of similar to&nbsp; that, you know. Um I think they're creatures.&nbsp;&nbsp; I I've heard the name um creatures from the Kanes&nbsp; Empire being banded around. Um I think they're&nbsp;&nbsp; extraterrestrials from Sirius. I've never heard&nbsp; of them before. I've nobody's ever talked about&nbsp;&nbsp; them before. They're on YouTube. But well, nobody&nbsp; said there are um sort of bipedal wolf people from&nbsp;&nbsp; Syria, Kanas Empire, but it's just when I saw&nbsp; the footage on YouTube, the flying humanoids,&nbsp;&nbsp; um they were it was similar to what&nbsp; I saw in the jungle in Panang. And&nbsp;&nbsp; uh that was a an unsuccessful mission there.&nbsp; Yeah. But that's a that how long was that in&nbsp;&nbsp; in in the planning of what happened that um that&nbsp; this creature was detected? Um he apparently the&nbsp;&nbsp; creature had come into the area. There was&nbsp; some military conflict going on in Malaysia&nbsp;&nbsp; at the time the SAS the SAS. Is that because that&nbsp; those creatures are used to train uh more of the&nbsp;&nbsp; um enhanced superchild type children by&nbsp; the SS? Um this creature had come in to um it was somehow learning about human emotions.&nbsp; It was learn it was learning from the conflict&nbsp;&nbsp; of the soldiers killing each other in the area.&nbsp; It was something to do there was some military&nbsp;&nbsp; conflict in the SAS on the border of Malaysia&nbsp; and Thailand all the time. And uh the this is&nbsp;&nbsp; a conflict that we could look up. Yeah, it was&nbsp; an official conflict, an official war. And the&nbsp;&nbsp; creature had come in, it was it was learning about&nbsp; the human emotions. It was studying the conflict,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it was almost feeding when the soldiers&nbsp; were killing each other in the jungle. It&nbsp;&nbsp; was almost feeding off the energy almost in&nbsp; a sexual way, feeding off the death and the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh fear and the hate. So, it's very nasty. So&nbsp; then that would be useful for reprogramming&nbsp;&nbsp; or programming more super soldiers or more more&nbsp; enhanced soldiers. Well, the creature turned up&nbsp;&nbsp; at peace more and was used in the programming.&nbsp; So it turned up at peace more before or after.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was years later. Yeah. Oh, years later. This&nbsp; years later. Yeah. If it came back to the planet,&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean it might have never have left the&nbsp; planet. So why were we trying to pursue&nbsp;&nbsp; it to kill it? Or were we going to kill? Were&nbsp; you trying to kill it? Um I think they were&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to kill it. But then I would have&nbsp; then come back in and say hello because it&nbsp;&nbsp; obviously escaped and then it had um it it had&nbsp; its um human collaborators which were probably&nbsp;&nbsp; these factions that we've talked about that&nbsp; have got human race best interest at heart. [Music] [Music]&nbsp;&nbsp; In part three, Michael Prince claimed the Looking&nbsp; Glass project was a piece of hardware involving&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercury. It allowed operators to open portals&nbsp; into different timelines. Could this be related&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Nancy Bell project from World War II?&nbsp; He describes his life as James Casbold with&nbsp;&nbsp; his carer Kate Casbolt. This gave a background&nbsp; to life as James and his stepfather who died&nbsp;&nbsp; in prison in 2003. The MI6 connection is further&nbsp; enhanced. A complex, sickening family arrangement&nbsp;&nbsp; involving child abuse, satanic rituals is familiar&nbsp; territory. In this dark tale of mind control, the&nbsp;&nbsp; Nazi SS in a modern age, and an alien human war.&nbsp; While a young child in 1982, his service on an&nbsp;&nbsp; active mission in Panang, Malaysia is described.&nbsp; The pursuit of a humanoid bipeal wolf type alien&nbsp;&nbsp; is described. [Music] In this final section,&nbsp; Prince's missions in Brazil and an active mission&nbsp;&nbsp; involving Dave Maro, who we saw in Beta 7, and&nbsp; a shootown of a strange octoform alien creatures&nbsp;&nbsp; craft in St. Ives and Cornwall in March 2011.&nbsp; Prince declares, \"World War II is in progress&nbsp;&nbsp; and we're going to win it.\" The viewer must study&nbsp; Prince's voice and mannerisms to see just how much&nbsp;&nbsp; of this is actually true or some kind of wild&nbsp; fiction with access to incredible detail. With&nbsp;&nbsp; more to follow from Caswell's colleague, the Grid&nbsp; Keeper, I'm Barry King. We now bring you Michael&nbsp;&nbsp; Prince in part four. Any further points you want&nbsp; to get across this time? Um, I'd just like to&nbsp;&nbsp; mention two points quickly. Um after that we I was&nbsp; transferred to um a facility in South America uh&nbsp;&nbsp; Manus near Brazil. This was actually a facility&nbsp; in the Andes mountains big underground city and&nbsp;&nbsp; that was another NSA facility code named Plume and&nbsp; um we we were George Bush Senior was there again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was that when he was president? Um this was or&nbsp; as vice president. This was 83 84 mid80s working&nbsp;&nbsp; um and yeah manas Brazil facility code name&nbsp; plume and uh in the Andes mountains and it was&nbsp;&nbsp; it was that was a Nazi training facility that we&nbsp; were trained in a huge hall there and there were&nbsp;&nbsp; groups of children divided into 1520 there hugest&nbsp; hall some of them would be um doing climbing wall&nbsp;&nbsp; climbing some of them be shooting martial arts and&nbsp; it um the hall had two Nazi bands near the door,&nbsp;&nbsp; one on each side, swastikas and um Dr. Green&nbsp; was there because um project Ibis was started&nbsp;&nbsp; in 1972 at Tavistock Institute and um doc Dr.&nbsp; Green was one of the people that started it and&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph Mangallay from Awitz. He was at Bloom.&nbsp; Joseph Mangallay, he programmed us. Um George&nbsp;&nbsp; Brcina programmed us. We did operations there.&nbsp; George Brcina actually gave us medals there for&nbsp;&nbsp; that facility. We all lined up. Is that where the&nbsp; Nazis I mean Brazil or that part of South America&nbsp;&nbsp; is be known for where the Nazis went after World&nbsp; War II? This is Manus. Manas. Yeah. And um yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; the second point is um the we mentioned there's&nbsp; a cloning aspect of this. Um we a couple of years&nbsp;&nbsp; back um 2008 it was um close friend of mine um&nbsp; driving along the motorway in Worththing and C&nbsp;&nbsp; pulls up behind him starts flashing his lights and&nbsp; uh there two guys there one of the guys is going&nbsp;&nbsp; like that to pull over. So my friend pulls over,&nbsp; the car pulls up. Um, guy gets out in his suit,&nbsp;&nbsp; opens the door and says his name. He says, \"Could&nbsp; you come with us, please?\" Uh, and uh, I'd like&nbsp;&nbsp; you to follow my colleague along the road. And um,&nbsp; my friend became very compliant. This guy gets the&nbsp;&nbsp; guy in the suit gets in the passenger seat, cars,&nbsp; says, \"Can you follow my colleague drive along the&nbsp;&nbsp; motorway? Follow it up. Drive into a car park. up&nbsp; there's an SUV in the car park and um they door&nbsp;&nbsp; opens. First person he sees sitting in the SUV&nbsp; is me. Um second person he sees is another person&nbsp;&nbsp; that's here pro um another close friend of ours.&nbsp; Third person he sees is a perfect replica clone&nbsp;&nbsp; of himself sitting in the SUV. Can you mention&nbsp; the other person that's here at Pro? I won't&nbsp;&nbsp; mention his name on camera. We can talk about it&nbsp; afterwards. Okay. Um he it's one of those SUVs&nbsp;&nbsp; um like a little conference room and back table&nbsp; like five seven chairs around it. There's two&nbsp;&nbsp; other young guys that we he'd never seen before&nbsp; and um you get in and say shut the door. The&nbsp;&nbsp; the guy the other guy waits outside and they all&nbsp; sit down. They all just sit there staring at each&nbsp;&nbsp; other. He's got a clone of himself. He's fully&nbsp; conscious. Got a clone of himself sitting there&nbsp;&nbsp; looking back at him. Um the the the operative in&nbsp; the suit says, \"Okay.\" Says his name, \"What have&nbsp;&nbsp; you got to tell us?\" He turns around and says,&nbsp; \"I don't know what you're talking about.\" And uh so I'm sitting there at the time, my clone is&nbsp; in St. I with my with the Casbol family. There's&nbsp;&nbsp; pictures of him there. And um so again, you&nbsp; know, sitting there and he says there's silence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone's just sitting there staring at each&nbsp; other. Really bizarre situation. Again, the guy&nbsp;&nbsp; goes, \"Okay, what have you got to tell us?\" And&nbsp; again, he says, \"I don't know what you're talking&nbsp;&nbsp; about.\" And then the guy say, \"Okay, I think this&nbsp; meeting's over.\" Then when he says that, the guy&nbsp;&nbsp; um just open the guy outside just opens the door&nbsp; like they're communicating telepathically or get&nbsp;&nbsp; out. They just drive off, just leave me standing&nbsp; there in the car park. And um there's a picture&nbsp;&nbsp; of one of my clones, a photograph of one of my&nbsp; clones in Iraq working for Blackwater. And they&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the intelligence community put it on the front&nbsp; cover of Ice Spy magazine. And we've got a copy.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can see the picture on the internet. What&nbsp; edition of Ice Spy? 40 42 or 47. I can I've got&nbsp;&nbsp; the picture. I can send you a link. And um I mean&nbsp; it's a perfect clone, but there's no tattoos. Does&nbsp;&nbsp; he know that it's Did he Is he aware it's a copy&nbsp; of you? Is is the what the clone? Yeah. I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know what he's aware of. It's not Can we talk&nbsp; to him? I mean, there's only one me. Yeah. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; he Yeah, but that's, you know, that's that's&nbsp; there on the front cover. There's also some&nbsp;&nbsp; um crash retrieval video footage taken in Chin.&nbsp; Um there's me at the crash retrieval site just um there's another person here is here at probe and&nbsp; that's two people here. Yeah. No, there's me and&nbsp;&nbsp; another person here at probe now. They're at the&nbsp; site of the crash retrieval footage. There's a a&nbsp;&nbsp; shot down alien ship on the video footage.&nbsp; There's a group of reptilians on the video&nbsp;&nbsp; footage. that there's a body a small alien body&nbsp; as um not tape a body or it's it's filmed by um&nbsp;&nbsp; an associate of ours is connected to the SAS it&nbsp; it's filmed at Goodwood Hill in Chichester near&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodwood airfield at night. Um he's filmed it from&nbsp; about a mile away. It's a series of hills. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; very indistinctive material. But it's not sort of&nbsp; there at the alien or what you can see if if you&nbsp;&nbsp; examine it closely and look at it, you can see&nbsp; that there's a group of beings that if you can&nbsp;&nbsp; compare the other guy who's probably very tall, 6'&nbsp; 3. Yeah. That these group of aliens walk past him.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a tower above him. They must be 8t tall&nbsp; on it. And they're carrying the body away. They're&nbsp;&nbsp; all they're all walking. Are they veil? They're&nbsp; reptilians. Yeah, these creatures with horns. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can make out the horns if you look closely&nbsp; if you blow Are they stuff horns or um not huge,&nbsp;&nbsp; just that here. Short stubs. Yeah, short stubs.&nbsp; And you you can make it out on the video footage&nbsp;&nbsp; if you blow it up and keep stopping it. Look&nbsp; closely. You can see the horns on the head. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um there's they they all walk in perfect&nbsp; sync together like robots. Like they all&nbsp;&nbsp; are collective. You can see that. You can see&nbsp; they're not walking human. on it. They walk,&nbsp;&nbsp; they carry the body back to their ship. You&nbsp; can see their ship on the left hand side.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see an object would have been. Yeah.&nbsp; Come in. And then there's um the fire engine&nbsp;&nbsp; to the right and the vehicles. That's where the&nbsp; SAS were. That's where I was on the right hand&nbsp;&nbsp; side. My friend who's a pro and another two&nbsp; of our associates there stood in front of the&nbsp;&nbsp; um ship. Now the when the reptilians walk past&nbsp; my friend, you can see them if you slow it down&nbsp;&nbsp; again. Look at a few times blow up. You can&nbsp; see he freaks out a lot when they walk past&nbsp;&nbsp; him. That was a shock because they're so close.&nbsp; Scary things and he's they got close. You see&nbsp;&nbsp; him from a distance you have, you know, bit&nbsp; of denial there up close. You can see him,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know. Look at that. And um they're passing&nbsp; some sort of hardware. uh the those operatives,&nbsp;&nbsp; those human operatives near the craft have&nbsp; passed hardware back to the reptilians that&nbsp;&nbsp; they just been loaned and it's again these little&nbsp; these small cube type devices and these cube type&nbsp;&nbsp; devices they do they have many um they do many&nbsp; things and they operate by thought. Yeah, they&nbsp;&nbsp; connect to brain waves. They on this particular&nbsp; night there was my friend doesn't remember&nbsp;&nbsp; everything about the operation. I don't remember&nbsp; everything about it, but there was something to do&nbsp;&nbsp; with we brought this craft down with these cubes&nbsp; against some kind of particle beam weapons. And&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll just end it as you can you can see the&nbsp; craft has been shot down behind my friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever been involved with off mission off&nbsp; off planet functions? Yes. And uh when we talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about off planet was extraterrestrial physically&nbsp; in this universe or is it been through a portal of&nbsp;&nbsp; some kind like often into a different dimension?&nbsp; This was um Sirius a planet on Sirius and this was&nbsp;&nbsp; um how what was involved there? Um this was&nbsp; the a transport from the facility in London.&nbsp;&nbsp; um mid '90s um transported on the underground tube&nbsp; system through a Stargate from London to a planet&nbsp;&nbsp; on Sirius. Is there a particular train station&nbsp; that is a Stargate? Um there's these Stargates&nbsp;&nbsp; in London. London uh CL you go that's so that's&nbsp; basically near Westminster. Yeah. You park there's&nbsp;&nbsp; a hotel on Park Lane and there's an underground&nbsp; car park there. You can drive into that if you got&nbsp;&nbsp; the clearance. Go down the lift. Then you can get&nbsp; into the lower sections. If you got the clearance,&nbsp;&nbsp; get on the train through the Stargate to this&nbsp; planet and see it. It's like a water well with&nbsp;&nbsp; a big land mass in the middle. There's a facility&nbsp; on the ocean bed which is a perfect replica of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Pentagon. Why does have to be perfect replicent?&nbsp; Or the replica or the Pentagon is a perfect&nbsp;&nbsp; replica of this facility. That's more correct.&nbsp; Yes. But I think this facility in Syria has been&nbsp;&nbsp; there thousands of years and they basically So&nbsp; that means they must have known about this and&nbsp;&nbsp; seen it obviously to build it there. Well,&nbsp; they've been there the uh the people I think&nbsp;&nbsp; the people that built the Pentagon have been to&nbsp; this place and it's divi it's interesting because&nbsp;&nbsp; it's I think it's divided into like seven. It's&nbsp; a Pentagon within a Pentagon within the Pentagon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each um section facility houses a different alien&nbsp; race and it's actually an artificial intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp; facility. It's the facility is an intelligent is&nbsp; an artificial intelligence. It's actually an AI&nbsp;&nbsp; based computer system controls the facility&nbsp; and controls each alien race in each section&nbsp;&nbsp; of the facility. And AI is doing experiments&nbsp; to see which of the races um in the universe.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there's seven root races. The artificial&nbsp; intelligence is is doing experiments to see which&nbsp;&nbsp; one is the has the highest survival dynamics,&nbsp; which race is basically the most powerful. And&nbsp;&nbsp; uh so this artificial intelligence uh who was&nbsp; it made by? I think it's really old. But you&nbsp;&nbsp; mentioned in some of your your emails about an&nbsp; artificial intelligence system which has taken&nbsp;&nbsp; over the planet and we are trying to fight against&nbsp; that. Is that is that something? did take over the&nbsp;&nbsp; planet, but there was some operations last year in&nbsp; France in the north of France and it was they it&nbsp;&nbsp; was shut down on how does it manifest itself?&nbsp; I've got a theory that the electricity supply&nbsp;&nbsp; system and the computer supply system and the&nbsp; broadcast system are being used by an artificial&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence to take control of us. That's that's&nbsp; what I summarizes what's going on. Is that related&nbsp;&nbsp; to that? This is a huge subject. It's a huge&nbsp; scientific subject and I know a fair amount of it,&nbsp;&nbsp; but um it's all included in um the project IBIS&nbsp; data that's being released on um Camelot by Kerry&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassidy. Right. So all people need to do is type&nbsp; in James Casbot Ibis and um that will come up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that being released by you personally or is&nbsp; it being released under your name when you're&nbsp;&nbsp; under that? That is my data that's being released&nbsp; by Kerry in that paper in those papers and that&nbsp;&nbsp; data on Camelot. Um I'm talking about the physical&nbsp; um computer system how it operates. Um are they&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially vehicles being used by the agencies&nbsp; to disinform or inform or both? Um probably say&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a m I mean mixture. Yeah, mixture. It's&nbsp; uh there's some good information coming out. What things should we look for? We Okay,&nbsp; it's um alien human war, World War II,&nbsp;&nbsp; alien human war. And that is going to be&nbsp; manifest as sort of 80s running down the&nbsp;&nbsp; street shooting people or flying saucers landing&nbsp; on Blackpool Tower. It's happening all the time,&nbsp;&nbsp; Miles. There's um I told you know I sent you&nbsp; the briefing report about what happened in&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Ives a couple of weeks back which is in&nbsp; broad daylight. A ship was shot down. There&nbsp;&nbsp; was a jets over the over my daughter's school&nbsp; military jet. Next thing this was in 3:15 in&nbsp;&nbsp; the afternoon. The ship was shot down. It came&nbsp; down in the back garden on Park Avenue. police&nbsp;&nbsp; fire brigade and there some kind of octapform.&nbsp; They uh they sealed the roads off that I got sent&nbsp;&nbsp; up there. They got sent in and um an octop would&nbsp; be what I would describe as as an octopus. This&nbsp;&nbsp; was like a This was a physical large octopus.&nbsp; There's nothing about it. This is a kind of This was like a This was a physical large&nbsp; octopus. Yeah, there's nothing lyricic&nbsp;&nbsp; about this. This is the kind of thing&nbsp; that I've seen kind of break into the&nbsp;&nbsp; back of Sky Television. It was um it had&nbsp; come down. It had crashed into the shed,&nbsp;&nbsp; set the shed on fire on Park Avenue. Was this&nbsp; the craft or the glacier itself? No, the the&nbsp;&nbsp; the military jets had shot the craft down. It come&nbsp; down, hit the shed in the back garden of a house&nbsp;&nbsp; on Park Avenue. What size of things are we talking&nbsp; about here? Well, the the ship. The ship. Yeah. 20 not a big 20 30 ft. So this opt form exists&nbsp; really in an old craft in a well the optoform&nbsp;&nbsp; is that high that wide the tentacles maybe you&nbsp; know 6 ft um it basically it's the craft had&nbsp;&nbsp; set the shed on fire the thing had come out the um&nbsp; craft scuttled along the garden that's a good word&nbsp;&nbsp; um and that um climbed up the side of the building&nbsp; and broke the window and was hiding in the attic&nbsp;&nbsp; of this house, you know, and this is and there's&nbsp; there's paper reports in the papers about the fire&nbsp;&nbsp; breaking out and there was just another fire.&nbsp; A car had been set on fire a couple of hours&nbsp;&nbsp; before by by the military shooting alien ships&nbsp; down because it's World War II human alien war&nbsp;&nbsp; and people say people say it's disinformation.&nbsp; Uh they want to create an alien threat. They're&nbsp;&nbsp; sending PLFS in. These are all PLFS and it's all a&nbsp; big setup to um stage World War II stage in alien&nbsp;&nbsp; invasion. It it is not um there is groups working&nbsp; with there's human groups working with aliens to&nbsp;&nbsp; stage an alien invasion, but there's a real alien&nbsp; invasion at the same time. So there's a stage one&nbsp;&nbsp; and a real one at the same time. just in the way&nbsp; seven the 77 bowlings you had a you had a thing&nbsp;&nbsp; stage there and you the other the real yeah the&nbsp; real thing so um this is why this information is&nbsp;&nbsp; coming out this is going to increase this is you&nbsp; know you anytime you see a fire in the street now&nbsp;&nbsp; with police sealing the roads off am um ambulances&nbsp; fire engines and you're not allowed near it be&nbsp;&nbsp; suspicious investigate it find out what went on.&nbsp; So, we're losing the ability to keep the cover up,&nbsp;&nbsp; the lid on the cover up. So, at what point do we&nbsp; have a a holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] situation? Are we getting&nbsp;&nbsp; near to that point? Well, we're kind of in it&nbsp; now, but I don't think it's anything. We're&nbsp;&nbsp; going to win. This is um You don't think we're&nbsp; going to win? No. What I mean is we are going&nbsp;&nbsp; to win. when the when AI did this um these&nbsp; series of scientific tests to work out what&nbsp;&nbsp; race had the highest survival dynamics in this&nbsp; underwater facility. It was determined that the&nbsp;&nbsp; human race have the highest survival dynamics. Now&nbsp; there's um there's philosophies that say the human&nbsp;&nbsp; form is the original form in the universe.&nbsp; It's the most perfect form in the universe.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, and this is why so we got, you know,&nbsp; we're going to win. It's going to be about&nbsp;&nbsp; hering people into safety zones and we're&nbsp; going to have to take care of it. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; the average man on the street isn't not going to&nbsp; be able to do much. There'll be people already in&nbsp;&nbsp; the population who'll be activated to clear, move&nbsp; people along, to get people out of the way. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; at the same time dealing with the threat. So, it's&nbsp; being handled on every level. So, it's dangerous,&nbsp;&nbsp; but situations under control. You got a bit of a&nbsp; scar there. I just thought is this an example of&nbsp;&nbsp; uh of what was involved with your technology or&nbsp; um No, they Yeah, this is connected to it. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is connected to Royal Ber Hospital and&nbsp; there was um this Osiris program body parts. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; cuz sometimes if you get you get your body damaged&nbsp; instead of just surgery putting you back together,&nbsp;&nbsp; they might just cut the body part off and&nbsp; attach a new one. Some people know who my&nbsp;&nbsp; fiance is. We're getting married soon. um her&nbsp; story, her testimony, what she's been through will change the world in many ways. Is she able&nbsp; to discuss her at any time? Able to discuss it&nbsp;&nbsp; at the moment. There's too many implications&nbsp; with her. you know, with we're having constant&nbsp;&nbsp; harassment in many ways and we're having to take&nbsp; the the fight to the people um who are harassing&nbsp;&nbsp; us. We've got constant um protection, bodyguards,&nbsp; you know, we met when we met in France last year,&nbsp;&nbsp; she wasn't allowed into the country. She was&nbsp; detained in in Heathrow when she tried to visit&nbsp;&nbsp; me from America, some very nasty things happened.&nbsp; very nasty things. You I think you know about&nbsp;&nbsp; that. Yeah. And um we had to meet in France. We&nbsp; had a bodyguard there from a private security firm&nbsp;&nbsp; um chauffeur. He he drove us from France to um&nbsp; on the ferry. We came through Plymouth Border&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrol. We were pulled in again at Puma Border&nbsp; Patrol and uh the two MI5 officers turned up&nbsp;&nbsp; um posing as police officers and said&nbsp; they questioning me under um the some&nbsp;&nbsp; anti-terrorism act. They gave me the leaflet um&nbsp; 2006 anti-terrorism act said if I didn't answer&nbsp;&nbsp; that question they were going to arrest me. Um,&nbsp; the woman who taught questioned me look very much&nbsp;&nbsp; like Stella Remington ex head of MI5. Yeah.&nbsp; And when we came back from America recently,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, Director Baro was at the airport. Yeah.&nbsp; Director Bar Alfred Ber from MI6 was there&nbsp;&nbsp; to make sure you got through. Okay. Uh, he&nbsp; was there. We got through. Okay. But he was&nbsp;&nbsp; there just at the end just showing his face.&nbsp; just like the cavalry is there. Yeah. Yeah. So, what about um Nazis? Oh, god. Straight to&nbsp; the point. Um I'm interested in the fact that&nbsp;&nbsp; many many moons ago um in my more young and&nbsp; enthusiastic days I um supposedly allegedly&nbsp;&nbsp; channeled and that's the only way I can put it&nbsp; a whole load of information which seems to be&nbsp;&nbsp; coming true um or at least certainly becoming more&nbsp; mainstream. Um, and I always at the time believed&nbsp;&nbsp; that a lot of what people were experiencing&nbsp; um, in terms of alien abduction was to do more&nbsp;&nbsp; with secret research pro projects that probably&nbsp; originated back in the Third Reich. Um, what kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of secret research program? Well, I mean, I think&nbsp; everything from propulsion systems involving anti&nbsp;&nbsp; anti-gravity to to genetic, you know, research.&nbsp; Um and the um you know obviously they're trying&nbsp;&nbsp; to create an Uber man um an Uber race um genetic&nbsp; knowledge that potentially could cause unrest&nbsp;&nbsp; between racial groups obviously which has happened&nbsp; in the past um and which we don't want to happen&nbsp;&nbsp; again. That's deeper though. Deeper. What are&nbsp; those messages about the alternative technology,&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative propulsion systems and genetic uh&nbsp; research? You know, it probably wasn't clear in&nbsp;&nbsp; the first video, but I was a UFO researcher.&nbsp; I researched with London UFO studies. Uh I&nbsp;&nbsp; researched when I when I moved out of London with&nbsp; another local UFO group. Um so I came at it from&nbsp;&nbsp; that from things that had happened to me obviously&nbsp; got me into UFO research, but once I got into it&nbsp;&nbsp; and started looking at cases and you know, just&nbsp; take the case of Betty and Barney Hill, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole Nazi link there. Um and they were a&nbsp; mixed race family as well, which is interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, so I do think that that, you know, a an&nbsp; agenda, whether that agenda is an alien one&nbsp;&nbsp; or a human one is still happening that potentially&nbsp; started or at least revealed itself in in the in&nbsp;&nbsp; the Third Reich and in in some of the the stuff&nbsp; that was going on back in the Third Reich. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; whether or not, as some people allege, that links&nbsp; back to different alien groups seeding different&nbsp;&nbsp; bloodlines on Earth is anyone's guess. as some&nbsp; people alleged the Nazis believed they were,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, this alleged race that lived in, you&nbsp; know, um, Agata and Shambala. Um, honestly don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know. I mean, I've only just lit out a long&nbsp; time. And it's only recently that things have&nbsp;&nbsp; happened in my life. What's an connection with&nbsp; with Cornwall? Why did they want here? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, that's an interesting one. I don't know&nbsp; why. I mean, I can't I can only theorize. Just&nbsp;&nbsp; interviewed um Michael. Yeah. Prince. Yeah. And&nbsp; he's talking about the Nazi connection a lot in in&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that's right. And that's one of the reasons&nbsp; why I've decided to speak out because you know&nbsp;&nbsp; that he you know I I've only met him once and and&nbsp; he was obviously very much triggered by by Barry&nbsp;&nbsp; King's information. Um and you know obviously&nbsp; that made him remember and recall or connected&nbsp;&nbsp; with him on some level and now he is speaking&nbsp; about the Nazi link. It has made me think well&nbsp;&nbsp; he's in Cornwall more correctly the SS link. The&nbsp; SS. Yeah. Yeah. The SS the thing about the SS it's&nbsp;&nbsp; it's interesting with the SS. I mean the SS on&nbsp; one level was you know a police this is the whole&nbsp;&nbsp; point well is yeah we don't officially it isn't&nbsp; um but I mean yes I accept that there probably are&nbsp;&nbsp; you know operations and and and schemes that are&nbsp; of that ilk and possibly there is an SS now yes&nbsp;&nbsp; but I mean in terms of that what we know that we&nbsp; can prove they don't exist anymore what we do know&nbsp;&nbsp; about the past we can prove we hope we can prove&nbsp; um and there has been an awful lot of of research&nbsp;&nbsp; done on the SS that they were sort of everything&nbsp; from a secret police force, which obviously does&nbsp;&nbsp; link into the whole Big Brother agenda and the&nbsp; potential for chipping people, which again I&nbsp;&nbsp; think resulted from concentration camps and&nbsp; and and that was something they were thinking&nbsp;&nbsp; of doing then if that system had carried on um&nbsp; to um to intelligence gathering. They obviously,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, gathered intelligence. And then there&nbsp; was another side of the SS. But there was a more&nbsp;&nbsp; esoteric side that was definitely born out of&nbsp; um of research from groups like the Chula and&nbsp;&nbsp; the real society who did have um a whole aran&nbsp; race supremacy slant. Um taking that out of the&nbsp;&nbsp; equation however they also looked into exceedingly&nbsp; innovative technology. They had Shaburgger,&nbsp;&nbsp; they had you know a number of other people&nbsp; nonJewish physics in other words. Yeah. Well&nbsp;&nbsp; yes. Yes. I mean, I suppose I don't know if any&nbsp; people who were Jewish were involved. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; there is also a lot of evidence that that&nbsp; demonstrated there were an awful lot of Jewish,&nbsp;&nbsp; part Jewish uh members of the SS. And it does&nbsp; look as though the SS was selective in terms of&nbsp;&nbsp; who they felt they could use and who they felt&nbsp; they couldn't. Um, and I think that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; if you walk the walk and talk the talk and you&nbsp; had a couple of Jewish grandparents, if you were&nbsp;&nbsp; useful to the SS, they might have turned a blind&nbsp; eye as long as you did what they told you and they&nbsp;&nbsp; would have been a file on you as well. So, they&nbsp; you'd have done what you were told. Um yeah um&nbsp;&nbsp; but I think that things like Camela I think is one&nbsp; of the most interesting characters in the SS to go&nbsp;&nbsp; into if anyone's interested seriously in looking&nbsp; at this star. Um he basically took over from&nbsp;&nbsp; Hydrickch um a lot of the issues that Hydrickch&nbsp; was overseeing primarily to do with the final&nbsp;&nbsp; solution um but also the secret the more secret&nbsp; research projects on um on propulsion systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now at the time Hydrick was alive they weren't&nbsp; really very well known. I mean they were still&nbsp;&nbsp; in developmental stages. the Houndibu by that that&nbsp; and Camela took over those duties from Hydrickch&nbsp;&nbsp; and he became central figure in this Camela did&nbsp; and he was alleged he died three times or well&nbsp;&nbsp; there's there's three different Yes that's right&nbsp; there's three different examples of his death one&nbsp;&nbsp; one alleges that he was assassinated in Prague and&nbsp; that's interesting because actually Hydrickch was&nbsp;&nbsp; um assassinated in Prague there's another one I&nbsp; think that he went off to Argentina was it or one&nbsp;&nbsp; of the you know South American states rather like&nbsp; Ikeman did and then there was another one that he&nbsp;&nbsp; disappeared or I don't know. The only connection&nbsp; there was General George Patton. Okay. And he&nbsp;&nbsp; had to be assassinated because he knew too much.&nbsp; That's an interesting one that I haven't picked&nbsp;&nbsp; up on. And I also think Admiral Bird knew too&nbsp; much. And he encountered the German British&nbsp;&nbsp; Bird a year after Bird. I didn't know that. But&nbsp; Admiral Bird obviously went out with a number&nbsp;&nbsp; of battleships and and turned around pretty damn&nbsp; quick and said went back to Washington and said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Look, the next time we have a war, we're going&nbsp; to be dealing with craft that can fly from pole&nbsp;&nbsp; to pole in minutes.\" Um, and and they shut him up&nbsp; because I've interviewed a guy called John Irwin&nbsp;&nbsp; who witnessed two German descriptive saucers in&nbsp; the Jordanian Assyrian desert area until 1959.&nbsp;&nbsp; The original Hound of Technology. And when you&nbsp; when you go back to look, I mean, there's very&nbsp;&nbsp; little around about Maria Ortish. And there's also&nbsp; complications about how her name is spelled. A&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of people spell it Orick. O R S I C. I don't&nbsp; believe it was that. I believe it was Ortish. And&nbsp;&nbsp; I was always told, well, so people can research&nbsp; her if they want to. Maria Ortish. A U S T I C,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think. Um, or A U T I S C. Apologies for that.&nbsp; Um, but I mean again she was a real medium and&nbsp;&nbsp; she is the one who allegedly channeled the houndu&nbsp; blueprints or or certainly the instructions. Was&nbsp;&nbsp; it anything to do with an alleged an alleged crash&nbsp; in Germany in the 30s? There is an allegation&nbsp;&nbsp; involved with that. I don't know about Maronei&nbsp; obviously of course was involved with Cornwall&nbsp;&nbsp; because you've got the Maronei station. I mean&nbsp; crucially to do with broadcasting and yes well&nbsp;&nbsp; that's a possibility. I mean again I haven't&nbsp; looked into that. Um, but I mean there certainly&nbsp;&nbsp; is a rumor that that that in 1936 a a craft did&nbsp; crash in the Bavarian forest and that that's&nbsp;&nbsp; where Hitler got hold of the technology, you know,&nbsp; that they're sort of see having UFO experiences,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and they're coming out with stuff&nbsp; about Nazis. There's a sudden dramatic increase&nbsp;&nbsp; in people wanting to read about Nazi UFOs. It's&nbsp; really becoming quite, you know, a hot topic.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a new film. There's a new film coming&nbsp; out, Iron Sky. Now, that's a comedy. Obviously,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's it's being but it's like the Nazis went to&nbsp; the moon in in 1945 and now they've done they've&nbsp;&nbsp; got their technology now they're coming back to&nbsp; get their planet back and you know so there's all&nbsp;&nbsp; of that coming out as well and it does seem like&nbsp; this is the next stage you know you've had the&nbsp;&nbsp; whole grays everyone knows the gray image now I&nbsp; mean everyone's familiar with that whether or not&nbsp;&nbsp; we can what are the gray images because I've had&nbsp; information of a particular type of gray which is&nbsp;&nbsp; controlling major elements of sky television you&nbsp; see I don't I couldn't possibly comment on any of&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a type of gray with a walnut. Okay.&nbsp; Headed a headed skull. Walnut shell type&nbsp;&nbsp; skull with a very thick rimmed ridge down where&nbsp; the two halves of skull join. Okay. The um we're&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about the the mid-cranial bone ridge&nbsp; here uh where um the center of the skull joins&nbsp;&nbsp; together. That's because the two halves of the&nbsp; brain are completely isolated. Is that correct?&nbsp;&nbsp; in the what's known as the zeta reticular&nbsp; zeta reticulent or the gray. Um the shape of&nbsp;&nbsp; the brain is split in half by a mid-cranial&nbsp; bone ridge. The zeta reticulent's brain is&nbsp;&nbsp; uh not connected. The two halves of the brain&nbsp; are split uh by a solid ridge of calcium right&nbsp;&nbsp; down the middle of the skull. And it's interesting&nbsp; that um couple of years after uh being told that&nbsp;&nbsp; uh Puerto Rican drawing is I read the Spanish&nbsp; language and I started subscribing to a Spanish&nbsp;&nbsp; language magazine from Puerto Rico and uh one of&nbsp; the uh UFO witnesses drew an alien gray as having&nbsp;&nbsp; a midcranial bone ridge quite distinct line down&nbsp; the middle of the heads to make sure he conveyed&nbsp;&nbsp; what he had seen. So it's a very interesting&nbsp; correspondence there. uh do think Martin's&nbsp;&nbsp; uh evidencia of is a very useful reservoir of&nbsp; information for people who want to get sportive&nbsp;&nbsp; data albeit it is in Spanish. Nevertheless, for&nbsp; people to see exactly the same thing on a highly&nbsp;&nbsp; isolated island out in the middle of the Atlantic&nbsp; Ocean is uh surely quite strange. But with regards&nbsp;&nbsp; to Ron, I mean I'm fascinated in Ron. Um, but&nbsp; what happened to Ron? What happened to Ron? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, that's a really interesting question.&nbsp; What was Ron? What did he do? What did Ron do? Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I met Ron when I started um a UFO special&nbsp; interest group with Mensah when I was a&nbsp;&nbsp; member of Mensah. Um, and I wanted to get people&nbsp; with brain power to look at the situation and for&nbsp;&nbsp; a while it happened and Ron was one of the ones&nbsp; that offered to help me run the newsletter. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; now Ron lived quite locally to me. This was in&nbsp; North London. He, this is all I know of Ron. He&nbsp;&nbsp; originally ran an esoteric bookshop in um Hibbury&nbsp; um in Islington. Um I don't know when he closed&nbsp;&nbsp; that, but he was a Crowley. He believed very much&nbsp; in Alistister Crowley. Um he was also an amateur&nbsp;&nbsp; radio enthusiast and very skilled with that and&nbsp; was very big into sort of finding I you know more&nbsp;&nbsp; about this than me because I'm not a radio buff&nbsp; at all, but Scalar wave. Yeah. Over the Horizon,&nbsp;&nbsp; Woodpecker signal, which we filmed all those years&nbsp; ago, short before he died. That's right. And he&nbsp;&nbsp; was starting to to come out with this stuff and&nbsp; and starting to to really talk about it and and&nbsp;&nbsp; he had an interesting background and and actually&nbsp; the thing that that this is interesting that we&nbsp;&nbsp; bring Ron up because it is down to Ron. This&nbsp; started with me. I wanted to find out if I had&nbsp;&nbsp; been abducted by a UFO because I was having all&nbsp; these experiences and dreams and what have you&nbsp;&nbsp; that led to to my becoming quite overenthusiastic&nbsp; and probably making a total idiot of myself,&nbsp;&nbsp; but that's just how things worked out. Um, and&nbsp; I said to Ron, \"You really have got to help me&nbsp;&nbsp; find out what's going on.\" So he said, \"Look,&nbsp; I'll hypnotize you.\" Yes. I said, \"You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't mind you doing that because I trusted&nbsp; him.\" And he hypnotized me and all I did was come&nbsp;&nbsp; out with stuff about Hitler. all I just came out&nbsp; with all this stuff about Hitler and the SS and&nbsp;&nbsp; and I don't remember all of it because he didn't&nbsp; record it. He didn't write it all down, but he got&nbsp;&nbsp; extremely engrossed in what I was saying. And it&nbsp; wasn't that night, but it was a few weeks later&nbsp;&nbsp; where he actually told me that he looked into some&nbsp; of what I'd said. And he had this little sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; esoteric book that came from Germany. Um, and it&nbsp; was all in German. And I don't understand German,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I understood enough to know that what he was&nbsp; pointing out to me was true. And as he was reading&nbsp;&nbsp; and translating it to me that you know it was from&nbsp; what my limited knowledge of German and it looked&nbsp;&nbsp; certainly looked as though a lot of what I had&nbsp; alleged about the kind of experiences Hitler had&nbsp;&nbsp; um and say what those were. Well, yeah. I mean,&nbsp; again, you know, I can't prove or disprove this,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, but I can throw it out there and somebody&nbsp; else might know, um, that Hitler had visitations&nbsp;&nbsp; in the night from tall blonde beings, that&nbsp; Hitler, um, was basically in a nightmare state,&nbsp;&nbsp; that he was completely a fever pitch by this and&nbsp; and it completely engulfed him, and he had all&nbsp;&nbsp; these really kind of strange beliefs about being&nbsp; chosen to do something in particular and to bring&nbsp;&nbsp; in this new world and all of that with, you know,&nbsp; this this alternative technology, free energy,&nbsp;&nbsp; all of that kind of stuff. Um, and you know,&nbsp; that's basically what it was. And because the&nbsp;&nbsp; first question, excuse me, that Ron had asked me&nbsp; is, you know, have you, you know, not have you,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, you know, can you tell me, you know, what's&nbsp; happened to you in terms of UFOs and, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and do you have any sort of recall about having&nbsp; an experience with a UFO? And I and I laughed and&nbsp;&nbsp; said, \"No, well, they're not going to to bother&nbsp; with me because I know too much about it anyway.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; And proceeded to talk about Hitler and the SS.&nbsp; What was talking about in the SS? What? It was&nbsp;&nbsp; basically saying that most UFOs weren't even&nbsp; alien. They're not going to bother abducting&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody who was involved back then and who&nbsp; knew what was going on and and I didn't make the&nbsp;&nbsp; connection. You know, I I just We're referring&nbsp; to Nazi flying saucers. We're referring to the&nbsp;&nbsp; Houndibu and the Real Society and the Chula,&nbsp; which I knew very little about in those days.&nbsp;&nbsp; You're talking 1994. There was very little&nbsp; about any of that. I think the the video&nbsp;&nbsp; Secrets of the Third Reich Secrets of the Third&nbsp; Reich came out around I think. Yeah, I think he&nbsp;&nbsp; was around already. Michael Herman. Yeah. But I&nbsp; mean that it was only literally I hadn't seen it&nbsp;&nbsp; at that point. Um because it was after that that&nbsp; I went and bought it. Um when I saw it. So yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um but yeah, it was just basically that. Um,&nbsp; and then of course Ron and I being, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; that we were very interested in in the situation&nbsp; anyway, we just used to sort of talk about stuff&nbsp;&nbsp; that went on back in the war and he he he he felt&nbsp; stuff that went on. Well, with the final solution&nbsp;&nbsp; mainly and again it was I didn't really see what&nbsp; was the purpose of the final solution. What really&nbsp;&nbsp; was the purpose of it? Oh my god, that's a diff&nbsp; how can anyone say an awful lot of people? Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's some horrible theories. There's some&nbsp; horrible theories. What is the theory? the this is&nbsp;&nbsp; not my this is not my theory. Okay, this is not my&nbsp; theory just to categorically state that. I've been&nbsp;&nbsp; doing some research and I found everything ranging&nbsp; from it was a sacrifice that the um there's a&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a website that I found the other day that&nbsp; alleged that the the actual camps, concentration&nbsp;&nbsp; camps formed particular sacred geometry shapes&nbsp; and and various other things and that that there&nbsp;&nbsp; was some kind of an organized Yes. Yes. That&nbsp; that is the implication. Does this all seem to&nbsp;&nbsp; be pointing to that level into some other this is&nbsp; this is the implication and of course you know one&nbsp;&nbsp; wonders whether there is some kind of an agenda&nbsp; with another race of beings who potentially did&nbsp;&nbsp; give technology in return for this soul energy.&nbsp; out to bring in Can I bring in Well, I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp; anything about them and I don't I don't usually&nbsp; sort of Yeah, the Anunnaki. I do I think of them&nbsp;&nbsp; as the Anunnaki because I've read stitching.&nbsp; So, I suppose that's where I kind of came from&nbsp;&nbsp; with that. But my friend um basically alleges that&nbsp; that they are stuck in the she says it's they're&nbsp;&nbsp; stuck in the fifth dimension. Apparently, they&nbsp; falsely ascended themselves with monotomic gold.&nbsp;&nbsp; um and they're stuck. They basically be ascended&nbsp; without going through the the process that you're&nbsp;&nbsp; supposed to to get there. Again, my friend&nbsp; says that we are multi-dimensional, but the&nbsp;&nbsp; whole point is to bring all the aspects from all&nbsp; the dimensions into the one you are now. Yes. So&nbsp;&nbsp; that you that's what Chris Thomas said. Yes, I&nbsp; know. Because I looked at Chris Thomas. I thought&nbsp;&nbsp; that's exactly what my friend says. So I trust&nbsp; that because I trust my friend and that's the&nbsp;&nbsp; process that I've been going through myself which&nbsp; is why integrating some of my past life aspects&nbsp;&nbsp; has been pretty hard. I was blown away by some of&nbsp; what he said. Some of it I I didn't resonate with,&nbsp;&nbsp; but then that's the same with everything, you&nbsp; know. You don't you resonate with some stuff&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't with others. And but I felt that there&nbsp; was a hell of a lot of truth in the truest sense&nbsp;&nbsp; about what he said. Um, and I felt very much that&nbsp; that this is a truth that actually could appeal&nbsp;&nbsp; to the ordinary person on the street because it's&nbsp; nothing you have to become a particular guru or&nbsp;&nbsp; Buddha to actually experience. All you got to do&nbsp; is really find who you are. It's quite simple.&nbsp;&nbsp; My own personal theory, however crazy it sounds,&nbsp; is that, you know, we can affect our reality by&nbsp;&nbsp; our state of consciousness. And I don't think is&nbsp; this my take on this is that our our consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp; is being deliberately manipulated. So we do&nbsp; possibly that's a strong point. I mean that that&nbsp;&nbsp; that is a very strong possibility. Yeah. That you&nbsp; know that directly engineering reality and this is&nbsp;&nbsp; well this is again this is again the whole concept&nbsp; of creating one's reality with consciousness. If&nbsp;&nbsp; people are feeling like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] excuse my language,&nbsp; you know, they are going to respond accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're talking about scuttlers right now. Do&nbsp; you know them as scuttlers? I've never known&nbsp;&nbsp; them as scuttlers because they scuttle.&nbsp; Black spider crab type things. Yes. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; what happened? What did we see? Well, before&nbsp; I had an extremely weird experience in 1999,&nbsp;&nbsp; which I do not know whether it had a lot of weird&nbsp; experiences. I've had a hell of a lot of weird&nbsp;&nbsp; experiences. Weird. How weird is it? This was off&nbsp; the scale weird because I can't explain any of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, you know, I can't even really explain it with&nbsp; psychology because I went to see psychologists and&nbsp;&nbsp; none of them said that there was anything wrong&nbsp; with me. No, the trouble the trouble is that there&nbsp;&nbsp; was nothing wrong with me. That's the problem. I&nbsp; wanted there to be something wrong with me so I&nbsp;&nbsp; could take a pill and make it go away. But, but&nbsp; they could, you know, there was nothing wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; And because I was, you know, getting this whole&nbsp; load of information about what was happening in&nbsp;&nbsp; Bosnia and and every week I was predicting what&nbsp; was going to happen next. I kind of proved to the&nbsp;&nbsp; psychologists that that precognition is real.&nbsp; So actually he was very interested in me. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; but what we had before this strange experience&nbsp; that involved a signal going into my ear and the&nbsp;&nbsp; playing out of that's blue bean thing. I have no&nbsp; idea. This is the thing. I need to find this out.&nbsp;&nbsp; But but before that happened, we had my partner&nbsp; and I, my then partner and I had a whole load of&nbsp;&nbsp; nighttime visitations by something that made&nbsp; a noise under the bed. And I thought we had&nbsp;&nbsp; a mouse or a rat. Um, and you know, my exartner&nbsp; went under the bed when we heard this one night,&nbsp;&nbsp; screamed his head off. He wasn't the kind of&nbsp; man to be prone to flights of fancy at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said there was something black, like a crab&nbsp; under the bed. Uh, and he said it just shot past&nbsp;&nbsp; him. He was terrified. We were both went under&nbsp; the bed at that point and and with a torch and&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing was there. Um then the following night my&nbsp; youngest son saw it in his room. Um my eldest son&nbsp;&nbsp; uh who was young at the time um saw it in his room&nbsp; and we um What did he see? He saw a similar thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; He described it as being like a black hand moving&nbsp; around on its own. So it sounds very similar to&nbsp;&nbsp; what you saw. And that was about a week or so&nbsp; before I had this hugely dramatic experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; which did feel like a complete altering of&nbsp; my reality. I must admit reality. It was a&nbsp;&nbsp; reality reality. Well, it was it was the most&nbsp; bizarre thing. I was actually in the grounds of&nbsp;&nbsp; the place where my very wellressearched past&nbsp; life had lived. And I didn't realize it was&nbsp;&nbsp; my past life at the time at all. I had no inkling&nbsp; whatsoever. Wasn't interested in past lives in the&nbsp;&nbsp; slightest. But I took a step and as I took this&nbsp; step, I heard this God almighty clunking noise&nbsp;&nbsp; and it sounded like a big vault being opened. It&nbsp; sort of went like that like a big like a massive&nbsp;&nbsp; vault being open metallic. It went clockwise. It&nbsp; sound the sound went clockwise around me. It went&nbsp;&nbsp; like that like a kind of big metal seal opening.&nbsp; And simultaneously as this happened, there was a&nbsp;&nbsp; ripple of light that went all the way around the&nbsp; trees and made everything look really fluid. And&nbsp;&nbsp; it also felt at exactly the same time that my&nbsp; spirit had literally flipped around in my body.&nbsp;&nbsp; call it fluidic reality. I don't know what a&nbsp; fluidic space. But anyway, I just I said looked&nbsp;&nbsp; at my partner and said, \"Did you hear anything?\"&nbsp; He's like, \"No.\" And I was like, \"Okay.\" Feeling&nbsp;&nbsp; very very scared by it because it's about one of&nbsp; the only times that I've ever had something that&nbsp;&nbsp; no one else heard or or could see cuz you know&nbsp; when I've seen UFOs, there's been other people&nbsp;&nbsp; there and even when I had the strange channeling&nbsp; that, you know, it corresponded with a lot of what&nbsp;&nbsp; Barry King said. So, I've always been able to&nbsp; verify the things that I've had. And I couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; verify that at all. That was completely something&nbsp; that I had no understanding or comprehension of.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it was after that happened, a couple of days&nbsp; after that happened, that I had this signal going&nbsp;&nbsp; into my ear. Um, and it basically, what was it&nbsp; like? What was it sounded like white noise like,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, going into and it literally went into&nbsp; my ear. You know, sometimes when you pick up the&nbsp;&nbsp; telephone and you listen to your computer. Yeah.&nbsp; Like it did sound like a modem kind of thing,&nbsp;&nbsp; like an oldfashioned Yeah. Yeah. So, I don't&nbsp; know why they take that, but but of course,&nbsp;&nbsp; James Casbalt has alleged that that there's some&nbsp; that I'm involved in in one of these programs at&nbsp;&nbsp; Brecon Beacons, and I would like clarification on&nbsp; that. Really? Okay. You're talking to James Casp&nbsp;&nbsp; or Michael Prince. What exactly do you want&nbsp; to say to him or about that program? I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know anything about it. I mean, I don't honestly&nbsp; don't know anything about it. I I know that that&nbsp;&nbsp; Breham Beacons is a military facility. it's SAS&nbsp; training and things like that, but James has gone&nbsp;&nbsp; or Michael Prince has has elaborated more recently&nbsp; and he is alleging that that there's a lot of SS&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff going on. Um, and I don't know if that's a&nbsp; part of it. Um, I'd be very interested to talk to&nbsp;&nbsp; him about that. Um, I really would because I want&nbsp; to get things straight in my mind about the SS,&nbsp;&nbsp; about what's going on, what's what potentially&nbsp; started back in the Third Reich, um, and what,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, potentially is still happening now.&nbsp; So, that's something I would be very interested&nbsp;&nbsp; to talk to him about. But he has alleged that um,&nbsp; that there is a clone of me and he said on one of&nbsp;&nbsp; these forums and I can't remember which one it&nbsp; was. I never probably Yes, I think it was. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; it was Avalon, I think. and and he said that it's&nbsp; this clone of me is called Proax something with&nbsp;&nbsp; um with numbers after it. What numbers? Didn't&nbsp; say, but the post is up. Proact P R Oyphen AX.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I I honestly don't know. I mean, all I can say&nbsp; is that when I wrote when I had that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; whole thing going on, I wrote that that vanity&nbsp; published fact-based fiction about the grays.&nbsp;&nbsp; um that in the dreams I was getting I was having&nbsp; very high level conversations with what appeared&nbsp;&nbsp; to be high-ranking military personnel of what US&nbsp; yes American yes they weren't British where we&nbsp;&nbsp; having these conversations in some kind of base&nbsp; I mean but these were dreams you know I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; to make that distinction I don't know if this is&nbsp; real or whether it happened right but but that&nbsp;&nbsp; but the dream I mean the last dream I had was&nbsp; it was almost like you know massive debriefing&nbsp;&nbsp; between me and these generals and and I was being&nbsp; treated on their level in this dream. This is&nbsp;&nbsp; what's so strange. Any location recently? No. God,&nbsp; no. This is going back to before I spoke to Barry&nbsp;&nbsp; King. Jesus, you're going back 92 90 uh middle&nbsp; 94. It was around about summer 94. September I&nbsp;&nbsp; think it was. Do you have anything you want to say&nbsp; to Barry then just to round this off? Well, yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean it's you know I'm I'd love to catch up with&nbsp; him actually. Um I'd be very interested and how is&nbsp;&nbsp; he a bit ill. We remember talking to him yesterday&nbsp; but uh he wasn't able to do well give him my very&nbsp;&nbsp; best wishes. Um and you know obviously apologies&nbsp; for the fact that I did get quite excited in that&nbsp;&nbsp; early video. I mean it was excited I suppose what&nbsp; was really and there's an awful lot in that video&nbsp;&nbsp; which is even more important but I was talking&nbsp; to Barry on Skype the other day. He was saying&nbsp;&nbsp; that he put more information into the documents&nbsp; and people need to look at the documents that he&nbsp;&nbsp; was released and that's why the documents are&nbsp; available on on basis 2 take two. If you put&nbsp;&nbsp; the disc one into the computer and don't look at&nbsp; it as a DVD but look at as an ordinary data disc&nbsp;&nbsp; entire scan of the voice. Yeah, I've still got&nbsp; all my hard copies of the voice and there is a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of information in there. He's saying that he&nbsp; got more information out than he wasn't allowed&nbsp;&nbsp; to within the voice. Okay, that's the last&nbsp; thing he said to me the other day. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; certainly that's the first time I've spoken to&nbsp; him since 2001. Well, certainly from my point&nbsp;&nbsp; of view as somebody who experienced phenomena that&nbsp; I couldn't explain, meeting Barry, which is again&nbsp;&nbsp; why I was enthusiastic. Meeting Barry was, you&nbsp; know, amazing because I could, it was like, wo,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, this is like, oh my god, you know, this&nbsp; man is kind of coming from a completely different&nbsp;&nbsp; place to me. He hasn't had all the dreams and&nbsp; the psychic stuff, you know, but he's kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; confirming what I've been led to believe. And I&nbsp; suppose that in a way you do get a bit sort of,&nbsp;&nbsp; oh my god. Well, it is here, is it? It is. It's a&nbsp; It's a very big thing. It's a very big deal. And&nbsp;&nbsp; I was young, you know. Um and I and I do sort&nbsp; of, you know, think that perhaps I got a bit&nbsp;&nbsp; overenthusiastic about it. And there's a machine&nbsp; in there that's and they start seeing projected&nbsp;&nbsp; reactivated uh dead German soldiers, right? And&nbsp; they reanimate. Wow. And they also reanimate and&nbsp;&nbsp; come out of existence. They just suddenly just&nbsp; appear. And their task is to protect the outpost.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, that sounds very similar to what Ron Adams&nbsp; suggested was at Coped Hall. Cop hall. Yes. That&nbsp;&nbsp; we went to. And he mentioned this thing like a&nbsp; v a vending machine. He mentioned that there was&nbsp;&nbsp; a machine that was like a, you know, looked like&nbsp; a vending machine, but it effectively, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; did, you know, make kind of reanimated.&nbsp; No, we never we never got that. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; he said that that that it triggered stuff off&nbsp; and then all of a sudden military people would&nbsp;&nbsp; turn up. That's what I remember him saying. I&nbsp; mean, I might have got part any more in there&nbsp;&nbsp; because this is very important. All I remember&nbsp; when we went there, we obviously saw my camera&nbsp;&nbsp; started failing at I know it did. I know it did.&nbsp; But but he said that there'd been this rumor of&nbsp;&nbsp; of you know this machine that was like a vending&nbsp; machine um that had been seen there or that people&nbsp;&nbsp; had known to existed there that it was involved&nbsp; with some kind of secret project and that whenever&nbsp;&nbsp; this thing was there if you went there basically&nbsp; military people would turn up. Now I remember&nbsp;&nbsp; when we went there just arrive out of nowhere&nbsp; and see you off you know get rid of you. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; which happened like protect. Yeah, which happened&nbsp; to us. Yes, it did happen to us. We were seen off&nbsp;&nbsp; in no uncertain terms. Somebody turned up. Nobody&nbsp; was around, but somebody turned up in a Land Rover&nbsp;&nbsp; if I remember rightly. I don't know. I think it&nbsp; was a Land Rover. It was something. It wasn't a&nbsp;&nbsp; military vehicle, but it was a sort of, you know,&nbsp; it could have been sort of it could have looked a&nbsp;&nbsp; bit paramilitary to me. The whole thing about&nbsp; the guy looked paramilitary to me. Yeah. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; he definitely was military. Yeah, definitely had&nbsp; Yeah, he had links to that and he just turned up&nbsp;&nbsp; out of thin air when we were there filming and&nbsp; and got very interested in why we were there and&nbsp;&nbsp; and that's that's when Ron was actually quite a&nbsp; decent head. He looked healthy and yeah, Ron it&nbsp;&nbsp; wasn't very long before he died actually. So what&nbsp; what happened about the story about about Ron? The&nbsp;&nbsp; earring his earring he's wearing is a skull with&nbsp; a little snake a skull on the top of a snake.&nbsp;&nbsp; most interesting odd symbol, you know, for an&nbsp; earring. In what respect? Well, they're definitely&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of occultings or whatever. Esoteric,&nbsp; for want of a better word. You're not there. That was very interesting, wasn't it? No. He's faster than military. I think we interviewed Ron and uh we did the&nbsp; scale wave thing then went off to Rishion I&nbsp;&nbsp; think I think that day and he died. He died. He&nbsp; rang me up actually um a couple of weeks before&nbsp;&nbsp; he died. He was getting very very paranoid, very&nbsp; frightened. What happened to Ron? What happened&nbsp;&nbsp; to Ron? What do you know about his history with&nbsp; I don't know very much about his history with&nbsp;&nbsp; Rendles because we never talked about that.&nbsp; We talked about the Third Reich, which he&nbsp;&nbsp; was extremely involved with in terms of his own&nbsp; research. Um, but he phoned me up and he he got&nbsp;&nbsp; really frightened and he said, \"Look,\" he said,&nbsp; \"Something's going to happen to me.\" He said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"They're coming more and more,\" meaning grays,&nbsp; because that's what he was having, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; experiences with. He said, \"Something's going to&nbsp; happen to me.\" Now, his wife had said that he was&nbsp;&nbsp; getting to the point where he actually wanted to&nbsp; turn his study into a Faraday cage. He wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp; put chicken wire all the way around it because&nbsp; he felt that was the only way that they couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; get at him. Now she was very worried about he's an&nbsp; esoteric specialist. Yes, he was. So he would have&nbsp;&nbsp; known of all forms of protection and crystals and&nbsp; salts and all sorts of other things. He was he was&nbsp;&nbsp; a true occultist and he was then reduced to the&nbsp; stage of using chicken wire to protect himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was that frightened. He was that something&nbsp; was frightening him or something was making him&nbsp;&nbsp; paranoid. I don't you know I mean he he seemed he&nbsp; didn't seem paranoid to me when I spoke to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; His wife felt that he was but obviously she was&nbsp; with him all the time. Well that's the impression&nbsp;&nbsp; she gave me. But I mean that was that was the&nbsp; implication that he felt that something was out to&nbsp;&nbsp; get him. He said that's it. They're going to get&nbsp; me. Now he had mentioned that he thought he had an&nbsp;&nbsp; implant. And of course, I tried to calm him down&nbsp; by saying, \"No, they won't. They won't.\" Because,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, what else can you say, you know, when&nbsp; you've got somebody really upset on the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, somebody you really care about, too.&nbsp; Cuz I did, you know, not over what period of time&nbsp;&nbsp; did this happen? This happened 2 weeks before he&nbsp; died. Approximately 2 weeks before he died. And&nbsp;&nbsp; which would have been a week or so after I did the&nbsp; interview. Yeah, it was it was Yeah, exactly. It&nbsp;&nbsp; was within weeks that all this happened. Um, and&nbsp; and that was it. The next thing I knew, you rang&nbsp;&nbsp; me and said, \"Mom's dead.\" And I was absolutely&nbsp; flabbergasted by that. I was complet I felt I felt&nbsp;&nbsp; also like I failed him because obviously I was&nbsp; you know I didn't I didn't really believe that&nbsp;&nbsp; that he was as in as much risk as he felt he was.&nbsp; Um but I didn't know about the Bentwaters thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Adams family is a family I met around&nbsp; about 1994 and they were the only civilian&nbsp;&nbsp; family to have lived in US Air Force headwaters&nbsp; from 1970 to 1976. They were um surrounded by&nbsp;&nbsp; military personnel and were very friendly with&nbsp; all of the military personnel. Uh they would go&nbsp;&nbsp; on all the dances, go to the all the Christmas&nbsp; parties, birthday parties of children, all the&nbsp;&nbsp; um you see the new year in you know uh so from&nbsp; 1917 to 1976 they left in 1976 and Ron started&nbsp;&nbsp; running a bookshop in Ivory in London. Uh the shop&nbsp; is just a kind of supernatural orientation type of&nbsp;&nbsp; bookshop um in Ivory and Ron kept it going. But&nbsp; I would think that the most uh important thing&nbsp;&nbsp; about the whole family is that Ron, his wife, his&nbsp; two sons and a daughter-in-law all believed that&nbsp;&nbsp; while during any stay at uh Yuru for Fetch Waters,&nbsp; they were abducted by aliens. The whole family,&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole lot. I talked to the wife. I talked to&nbsp; Ron the father. I talked to one of the sons and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the son indeed whose name I can't remember uh&nbsp; was very traumatized and had an instantaneous fear&nbsp;&nbsp; of terror of spiders. I think it was the younger&nbsp; of the two sons. Uh he was the only one that I&nbsp;&nbsp; met when I was at Bronze uh in Chase Road in&nbsp; 1984. But he was uh very traumatized looking&nbsp;&nbsp; in my opinion. He had a sudden fear of spiders&nbsp; as I said after induction which is like another&nbsp;&nbsp; abductee in Edinburgh that I've met saw you this&nbsp; guy all of a sudden he whole whole life he's had&nbsp;&nbsp; an absolute terror of spiders to get on to the&nbsp; family living away from US Air Force Bwaters&nbsp;&nbsp; from 1976 to 1980 they carried on their connection&nbsp; with US Air Force Bwaters personnel socially. So&nbsp;&nbsp; they carried on going to all the birthday parties&nbsp; and all that. So I would say it's also interesting&nbsp;&nbsp; that the daughter-in-law uh to obviously betrothed&nbsp; to one of Ron Adam's sons coming from a completely&nbsp;&nbsp; different family also stated that she thought&nbsp; she'd had incredible experiences whilst staying&nbsp;&nbsp; overnight in US Air Force Bwaters. uh she believed&nbsp; that aliens had come through the walls and ran&nbsp;&nbsp; around her bed and that was very similar to what&nbsp; Ton Adams wife was talking about whom I did speak&nbsp;&nbsp; to personally but um I don't really see why two&nbsp; completely separate families should be wanting to&nbsp;&nbsp; claim the same thing which is utterly fantastic to&nbsp; us then you know right now even in 2010 sounds too&nbsp;&nbsp; unbelievable too difficult to believe. Well, Ron&nbsp; certainly was being abducted a hell of a lot and&nbsp;&nbsp; it worried him and it worried him enough to try&nbsp; to put the grace off abducting him by smoking a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot. Uh he would say to me that he was uh smoking&nbsp; just simply to put the grays off to pollute his&nbsp;&nbsp; blood deliberately and make his blood useless&nbsp; to the gray. So he definitely had this picture&nbsp;&nbsp; which I'd uh been told about a couple of years&nbsp; before by another source who was MI5 connected and&nbsp;&nbsp; um Ron was uh smoking pretty badly and dangerously&nbsp; just simply in terror of being abducted by the&nbsp;&nbsp; grays. So we're a little bit suspicious that&nbsp; Ron's death at the age of 65 while recorded as&nbsp;&nbsp; being of a heart attack does relate to his being&nbsp; abducted by the aliens. be not beyond the kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of conversations we'd all had together cuz when&nbsp; we met privately to do the newsletter, we always&nbsp;&nbsp; ended up talking about the SS. It was bizarre. We&nbsp; would talk about everything from from the ovens at&nbsp;&nbsp; Avitz to to you know to the sort of the howibu&nbsp; which you know obviously we knew that they had&nbsp;&nbsp; flying discs. Yeah. didn't mention Bell that we&nbsp; didn't you know that didn't come up at all but I&nbsp;&nbsp; mean it was like yes we both believed the Nazis&nbsp; had these these machines these and that you know&nbsp;&nbsp; these foo fighters were connected and things like&nbsp; that and and theories about the Tibetans and about&nbsp;&nbsp; how when when the allies stormed Berlin that's&nbsp; the well apparent I don't I mean again you know&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know but I mean Madame Glavatzky went out&nbsp; to Tibet um I know that and um you know we talked&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot about Madame Bllovatzky and we talked a lot&nbsp; about theosophy um and the the rumor that they&nbsp;&nbsp; they found um you know Tibetan soldiers dressed&nbsp; in SS uniforms in Berlin and again this this is&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of flaky stuff you can't really verify a&nbsp; lot of it you know I mean but I mean it is an&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting thing and we did used to spend quite&nbsp; a long time talking about stuff like that and&nbsp;&nbsp; was it true you know we sort of both felt that it&nbsp; probably was and we both felt that there was hell&nbsp;&nbsp; of a lot more than meets the eye about the whole&nbsp; SS situation and that it all goes back there. It&nbsp;&nbsp; always felt like it all went back to the SS. It&nbsp; really did. But, you know, then I mean he actually&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he did imply to me that he that he cuz he&nbsp; was obviously a lot older than me and I think he&nbsp;&nbsp; was born in in the late 40s. So, it's possible he&nbsp; could have been a reincarnated person from that&nbsp;&nbsp; era. It is possible whether or not he I think&nbsp; I'm sure he mentioned something like that once,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I can't be certain. But I know he's come back&nbsp; into our consciousness. top of conversation now in&nbsp;&nbsp; the same way as some other people. Well, he's come&nbsp; back to me very much because obviously since more&nbsp;&nbsp; and more stuff has come to me about this SS stuff&nbsp; of Nazis here, you know, um but but definitely a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of what is going on now in terms of secrets uh&nbsp; secret um agendas and not so secret agendas um you&nbsp;&nbsp; know initiatives to depopulate potentially like&nbsp; Codex Elementaris and FEMA camps, fusion centers,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of the thing weather engineering, a lot of&nbsp; that I believe goes back to the essay And I think&nbsp;&nbsp; you could take it all all roads lead to Rome and&nbsp; I think that you just got to go back to the SS&nbsp;&nbsp; and we need to get more people who are prepared to&nbsp; speak about what they know like you know my thing&nbsp;&nbsp; called practical reality and practical reality&nbsp; is very very interesting. I mean, I'm I'm very&nbsp;&nbsp; interested in that because it did feel to me term&nbsp; I came up with that. That's a good That's a good&nbsp;&nbsp; term because it did feel like that. It felt when&nbsp; I was going through my experience, it felt like&nbsp;&nbsp; I was simultaneously living in between three or&nbsp; four different realities and that whichever way&nbsp;&nbsp; I went in terms of how I felt was going to affect&nbsp; the wider, you know, the wider implications for&nbsp;&nbsp; my life. I was basically choosing paths and they&nbsp; would lead to different points. Um, so yeah, that&nbsp;&nbsp; that's kind of an interesting one. Okay. Any final&nbsp; words this time? No, the information speaks for&nbsp;&nbsp; itself. Is there any sort of one summation phrase&nbsp; you want to get across? One, what's the what's the&nbsp;&nbsp; bottom line? What's the what's the essence? It's&nbsp; a dangerous situation, but it's all under control.&nbsp;&nbsp; People shouldn't panic. But should they read up&nbsp; things, look up things, watch it? if they want&nbsp;&nbsp; to do their own research, this is that will help&nbsp; them. And where is the best place to stay across,&nbsp;&nbsp; stay tuned to deeper things. Um, again, they&nbsp; can check out um the project IBIS information&nbsp;&nbsp; if they just Google James Casbot Ibis. That's very&nbsp; detailed. It's very there's a lot of data there.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the one of the things which which which I&nbsp; get is is emails from a character very important&nbsp;&nbsp; person called the Reverend Anthony J. Pike. Okay.&nbsp; Anything you want to tell Mr. Pike? Lord St. Pike.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything honest? Tell any message you want to&nbsp; say to Mr. Pike? Um why why have you pulled&nbsp;&nbsp; his name out out of everyone? Well, he's he he's&nbsp; disappeared off. He said his saint his saintly um&nbsp;&nbsp; his saintly duties on earth had had finished. and&nbsp; uh about 4 weeks ago I a couple of months ago and&nbsp;&nbsp; he's off to a different planet but he's come back&nbsp; so I thought we'd send him a welcoming message on&nbsp;&nbsp; YouTube to say you know Lord St. Anthony say hello&nbsp; Anthony St. Anthony, God bless. Jehovah blesses&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Cosmic research.&nbsp; The chairman, Jehovah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He keeps&nbsp;&nbsp; he keeps the world informed. Yeah. He's good.&nbsp; Okay. He's got a good sense of humor. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; And anything for Barry? Barry? Yeah. You seen&nbsp; Barry recently? We're a bit worried about No,&nbsp;&nbsp; for Barry. No hard feelings. He He did what he&nbsp; had to do. He's a bit ill now. I gather he's&nbsp;&nbsp; not. Yeah. And I hope he gets better. And he no&nbsp; hard feelings. He I know who he is and uh he he&nbsp;&nbsp; did what he had to do. Okay. Okay. Good luck.&nbsp; God bless. Have mercy, Mr. Hall. Thanks, Miles. [Music] Yeah. [Music] Heat. [Music] After over 5 years, we now bring you the second&nbsp; video interview with James Casbolt. In bases 4,&nbsp;&nbsp; Casmalt expanded on Barry King's material,&nbsp; first released in bases 1 and two.&nbsp;&nbsp; King talked about generated life forms,&nbsp; horrendous mind and population control programs,&nbsp;&nbsp; mannequin and puppet master, all going on in&nbsp; Britain's Barkshire countryside at a base under&nbsp;&nbsp; the village of Peacemore. Casbolt highlighted&nbsp; even more horrific programs involving children,&nbsp;&nbsp; genetic experimentation, and further terrifying&nbsp; details. And even a base under parliament itself&nbsp;&nbsp; called CLC1. In bases two and four, a further&nbsp; witness, Matt Todd, gave us even more detail&nbsp;&nbsp; with the involvement of the US military in the&nbsp; abductions or myabs and how he killed four grays&nbsp;&nbsp; at a base where people's souls were kept in cages.&nbsp; Bases 7 gave a super soldier Dave Maro and his&nbsp;&nbsp; trauma-induced monarch programming selected at&nbsp; birth and trained to fight off planet. Perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp; Matt Todd demonstrated radio signals coming from&nbsp; his many implants. the existence of some other&nbsp;&nbsp; form of dimensional reality and a war with super&nbsp; beings is implied. So now in bases 9 we present&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Prince aka James Casbolt. This time the&nbsp; SS comes into focus and the nightmare continues.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is if any of these claims can ever be&nbsp; proved with factual evidential data. James&nbsp;&nbsp; Casbold. [Music] James, we met in a previous&nbsp; persona as James on previous edition of uh the&nbsp;&nbsp; basis series. You've got a different persona now&nbsp; or you've got two different um ways you portray&nbsp;&nbsp; yourself to the public. Can you explain what the&nbsp; difference is or why you've changed or has there&nbsp;&nbsp; been a change? Michael Prince, James Carpool.&nbsp; It's just a simple matter of I'm using the name,&nbsp;&nbsp; my birth name, Michael Prince. It's a name I&nbsp; was given at birth by my biological mother.&nbsp;&nbsp; So So where where's the story of the Casbold&nbsp; story? Um that was a family I was adopted into&nbsp;&nbsp; the Casbolt family. Yeah. So um that was um 81.&nbsp; Yeah. I need to go back to the beginning when I&nbsp;&nbsp; was a baby. The origins of Project Ibis. Um it was&nbsp; the name of the project I was um involved in uh or&nbsp;&nbsp; born into effectively um was named project&nbsp; Ibis and it was run by the NSA and MI6 and&nbsp;&nbsp; um it was it was um tracking of 42 children&nbsp; from different countries and um all those&nbsp;&nbsp; children were brought to a facility in Canada&nbsp; in the Rocky Mountains um underneath a small&nbsp;&nbsp; town called Nelson. And in what what countries?&nbsp; Why were they selected? Um according to the file&nbsp;&nbsp; information I've seen, they were se selected&nbsp; for cuz their DNA the um the NSA information&nbsp;&nbsp; I've seen um says that we have what they call&nbsp; blood prime which um it states anunnaki DNA.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is blood prime? What's what specifically are&nbsp; the differences? I think some type of alien DNA,&nbsp;&nbsp; human um alien hybrid. Is there any particular&nbsp; Reese's negative positive or anything like that?&nbsp;&nbsp; Um I think it there's that the Reese's negative&nbsp; factor in it. I think the the negative factor. So&nbsp;&nbsp; that how are the ch children selected as such?&nbsp; I mean does that mean there's some means of&nbsp;&nbsp; uh selecting is it proclusive from different&nbsp; you know at birth people's bloodline medical&nbsp;&nbsp; records I think the mothers were um selected&nbsp; and um the embryos were cloned embryos grown&nbsp;&nbsp; in a artificial environment um test tube babies&nbsp; and I think those from my understanding those&nbsp;&nbsp; um embryos were then implanted into specific women&nbsp; who gave birth and And then at the time of birth,&nbsp;&nbsp; the children were transported to the um&nbsp; underground facility at Nelson in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of that facility was a Q552. Where's&nbsp; Nelson? Is it in Manito Winnipeg or somewhere?&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a small town in the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; It's in uh British Columbia, Canada. um that so we were all taken there at the time of birth.&nbsp; Some some from America I think. Um there was some&nbsp;&nbsp; from South America obviously some from the UK. Um&nbsp; I don't know who the other 42 children are. I've&nbsp;&nbsp; got a rough idea now. Why 42? I don't know. Is&nbsp; it just just that's what the sample was? a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; significance in it. I don't know. I'm sure there's&nbsp; massive shoulders. Um, very blonde hair going&nbsp;&nbsp; almost white now cuz he's getting a bit older.&nbsp; Um, wears your classic MIB outfit, the fedora hat.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's his style of dress. There's the fedora hat,&nbsp; black suit. Um, piercing blue eyes. Has a scar&nbsp;&nbsp; down his left side. That's from the officer class&nbsp; from fighting. I'm not sure where he got the scar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, this guy amazing guy. The characteristic of&nbsp; German upper class is to have a a a scar. That's&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting. From sword fighting. It's interesting&nbsp; you say that. I didn't know that. Um, very&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting character. He um from Bavaria, close&nbsp; friends with Henry Kissinger. Henry Kissinger also&nbsp;&nbsp; from Bavaria. who seems to have an amazing ability&nbsp; to stay young and healthy, relatively speaking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, Alfred Bonner was the director of uh, security&nbsp; at Duly at the time of the Duly rescue. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's been a book published by Pilington, I&nbsp; think it is. Um, I could stand correcting saying&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole Doulsece thing is a fraud. They've stuck&nbsp; bits on the mountain to make it look as if what's&nbsp;&nbsp; going on. No, Dulce is real. Dolce is 100% there.&nbsp; So, I mean, why do you think there'd be elements&nbsp;&nbsp; within MI5 publishing books saying this stuff's&nbsp; wrong and it's shadows and it's it's a it's a&nbsp;&nbsp; fraud. I'm not really interested in the whole it's&nbsp; in your recent book has been published. Um, you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, I'm not really interested in all that. It's&nbsp; I know it's DOS is real. It's um it's a important&nbsp;&nbsp; place for the new world order. So, what's what's&nbsp; the function of Dulce? I mean, we've heard that&nbsp;&nbsp; there certain underground things in it which&nbsp; were released in the late '7s. Is there anything&nbsp;&nbsp; new about it? Is it current? I don't I've got a&nbsp; friend um in the CIA who works at Oakidge National&nbsp;&nbsp; Laboratories in Tennessee and he often works down&nbsp; at Dulce. Um I mean he sent me pictures of the&nbsp;&nbsp; first level color photographs and it's not really&nbsp; the first level isn't high tech. It's kind of just&nbsp;&nbsp; a damp old base, you know, like sort of it's a bit&nbsp; run down the first level. Not what you'd expect&nbsp;&nbsp; to see at all. The old elevator shafts and things.&nbsp; Are you able to try those pictures at all? Yeah, I&nbsp;&nbsp; can. I've um I think they were released on Project&nbsp; Avalon a couple of years back, right? I can show&nbsp;&nbsp; you those pictures. Um you know, but when you go&nbsp; down the levels, it does get more advanced down&nbsp;&nbsp; there. It's a essentially um Have you been down to&nbsp; those levels or have you been shown them? Um there&nbsp;&nbsp; is connections with um IBIS and Dulce Doulsece&nbsp; is essentially a um officially it's a psychiatry&nbsp;&nbsp; center. Um they when the um employees walk around&nbsp; the facility, there's certain sections with&nbsp;&nbsp; um people in like hospital rooms with um almost&nbsp; like prison rooms in a way, but not with bars,&nbsp;&nbsp; like um plastic windows and thick plastic. And&nbsp; um you know, you have people there in in hospital&nbsp;&nbsp; gowns and um sitting on their beds and it the the&nbsp; briefing is that they're um incurably insane and&nbsp;&nbsp; that they're doing high-risk um drug treatments&nbsp; on the insane and it's actually a top secret&nbsp;&nbsp; um psychiatry facility. That's what they're&nbsp; first told when they go in there. So uh and&nbsp;&nbsp; then they they never come out these people. Yeah.&nbsp; Um I think a lot of them don't come out. There's&nbsp;&nbsp; um as you go the hall these particular hallways&nbsp; um at these rooms in um the corridor curved round&nbsp;&nbsp; and every kind of 12 rooms you have an operating&nbsp; theater. These people are taken out as operating&nbsp;&nbsp; theaters there. And uh the Q552 facility in&nbsp; Canada in Nelson was um there was a lot of uh&nbsp;&nbsp; Nazi psychiatry um going on there. What sort of&nbsp; what are you talking about conditioning? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; for instance um at the facility they were um it&nbsp; was essentially a trauma center. Now they did a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of conditioning with us with wild animals&nbsp; and what they were doing there they they used&nbsp;&nbsp; um Canadian wolves, they used snakes, they used&nbsp; um cats, wild cats and tigers and things. Um they&nbsp;&nbsp; were giving us the attributes of wild animals. Um&nbsp; they were subjecting us to um um for when we were&nbsp;&nbsp; older um for allterrain warfare, jungle warfare,&nbsp; artic warfare. So we had the attributes of wild&nbsp;&nbsp; animal. How do you get the attribute of a wild&nbsp; animal? They used um they set up I think it was&nbsp;&nbsp; the second level down at the Q552. Um they set up&nbsp; a kind of pen. Um 30 ft 30 ft wide. Um they set up&nbsp;&nbsp; this pen. They put the babies in the pen and um&nbsp; they put wild animals in the pen. They might put&nbsp;&nbsp; snakes in there or you know wolves. Only one type&nbsp; of animal at a time. They didn't mix the animals.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was always one type. Now this um pen was&nbsp; very similar to a Skinner box they use in psych&nbsp;&nbsp; significance in it somewhere but I don't have that&nbsp; information. Many of the children were transported&nbsp;&nbsp; on private CIA jets small small jets or just just&nbsp; like le jets. Yeah. And um transported there. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; so what's the program? What specifically is the&nbsp; purpose of it? There's a lot of effort being put&nbsp;&nbsp; into this then. Why? Um, project IBIS is again&nbsp; the Nazi connection. The name comes from the&nbsp;&nbsp; um the Giza Intelligence Group underneath the Giza&nbsp; Pyramids. The Nazi group in World War II. What&nbsp;&nbsp; Nazi group is this? Um, it's known as the Giza&nbsp; Intelligence. The Nazi group. Which part of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Giza Plateau were they involved in? I don't know.&nbsp; I just know they were um based underneath the Giza&nbsp;&nbsp; pyramids. It was a facility, the Nazis in World&nbsp; War II. And um the name connects to Thoth, the um&nbsp;&nbsp; the immortal, the Egyptian. Is um some connection&nbsp; with an ibis bird would represent Thoth in Egypt.&nbsp;&nbsp; What are they were they trying to find in Egypt&nbsp; or what did they find in Egypt? I think they&nbsp;&nbsp; found some kind of life extension technology and&nbsp; this was effectively that this was a major part of&nbsp;&nbsp; the IBIS program was life extension regeneration.&nbsp; Is there is there some kind of chamber that you&nbsp;&nbsp; could mention or any any particular area? Yeah,&nbsp; there's the emerald chambers. The emerald the or&nbsp;&nbsp; the emerald rooms, but I think that is that's in&nbsp; more than one location. Um I'd rather not talk&nbsp;&nbsp; too much about the emerald rooms. I'd rather just&nbsp; focus um because it's such a complex subject. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; um is this to do with the storage of souls on&nbsp; the earth and the recreation on earth? This is&nbsp;&nbsp; very much physical um this is they at the um Q552&nbsp; we were being indoctrinated with Nazi principles&nbsp;&nbsp; um Germanic principles um were you indoctrinated&nbsp; by Nazis? Yeah, it was Nazi. It wasn't just Nazis&nbsp;&nbsp; there, but there was a big Nazi presence. Um, some&nbsp; of the philosophies were indoctrinated with there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, you see those philosophies in um, Germanic&nbsp; organizations to this day like the Odinist&nbsp;&nbsp; Fellowship in this country. Um, the philosophies&nbsp; are based around obviously the creation of an&nbsp;&nbsp; Uber man, a Superman. But, um, they see life on&nbsp; Earth as a means to an end. They're not trying&nbsp;&nbsp; to get somewhere else. They're not trying to get&nbsp; to heaven or another planet. They want to become&nbsp;&nbsp; physically immortal in this body on this earth&nbsp; and stay here. Now um we're also indoctrinated&nbsp;&nbsp; with the the Germanic belief in um endless&nbsp; warfare. Um is that would be our reality once&nbsp;&nbsp; we stayed here physically. We um our reality would&nbsp; be endless warfare and there'd be periods of rest.&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to maybe reorganize the the logistics&nbsp; or um they talked about the thousand-year Reich,&nbsp;&nbsp; a thousand years of peace. Um which would be&nbsp; periods of rest in between the warfare and then it&nbsp;&nbsp; would just be a continuous cycle. And um that was&nbsp; effectively um how they had indoctrinated us to&nbsp;&nbsp; be assassins when we were older so we could keep&nbsp; functioning. If we were concerned about the next&nbsp;&nbsp; um hit and had anxiety about that we wouldn't&nbsp; be able to carry out and function. But if in our&nbsp;&nbsp; mindset, if we believe that we were designed&nbsp; for endless warfare and it would never stop,&nbsp;&nbsp; um we would just accept that and be able and be&nbsp; relaxed when we were involved in assassination.&nbsp;&nbsp; And what kind of assassination or what kind of&nbsp; missions are we are we talking about here? Um this is in numerous countries. um many different&nbsp; ways. So it's it's um is it I mean we are we sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of going and doing a one two three bump somebody&nbsp; off or or just just that different types of of&nbsp;&nbsp; assassination. Um a lot of it was standard um&nbsp; gunplay. Um I mean that that came later on down&nbsp;&nbsp; the road. Obviously we were actually raised&nbsp; in this facility as babies. So from 1976 to&nbsp;&nbsp; 1979 we were raised in this base. Um the where&nbsp; it was in the mountains um it was underground&nbsp;&nbsp; but there was um it was above ground the main&nbsp; entrance. It was like an aircraft hanger and&nbsp;&nbsp; um what kind of general area are we talking&nbsp; about? What can you describe any? It's in&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountains. It's um it's a very private&nbsp; location near Nelson. Just near Nelson in&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountains. Would there be a mountain&nbsp; name you could name? It's near I think it I'm not sure the mountain name. I know that&nbsp; there's a um a logging compound nearby and&nbsp;&nbsp; there's an old um access route near the logging&nbsp; compound that actually takes you to the base in&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountain and Nelson's a very small town. Um&nbsp; again the above ground um section of it was a&nbsp;&nbsp; aircraft hanger and um when we were first brought&nbsp; there as bait is is it a is it got a runway and&nbsp;&nbsp; landing place or um it's fenced off high fences&nbsp; and um it has yeah it has a runway in front of&nbsp;&nbsp; the aircraft hanger if you come in but the um the&nbsp; aircraft hanger sits or fenced around the runways&nbsp;&nbsp; here and the aircraft hangers here. Yeah, it's&nbsp; quite a big building. Um but as babies we were&nbsp;&nbsp; um we slept in the aircraft hanger often&nbsp; because um it was essentially a trauma&nbsp;&nbsp; center. So they wanted us to be exposed to the&nbsp; cold and there was um sets of cops in there. So&nbsp;&nbsp; this is high up maybe a couple of thousand feet&nbsp; up high over the Rocky Mountain. Very high. Um it's near B National Park right where um so they&nbsp; we were kind of being exposed to the elements&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially. We slept there um in the aircraft&nbsp; hang with the doors open and there was rows of&nbsp;&nbsp; cops and we were under 24-hour armed guard all&nbsp; at all times. So we couldn't be rescued from&nbsp;&nbsp; that facility because there were factions there&nbsp; that would rescue us at the first opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The people that like the parents or or the&nbsp; well special forces groups um people that&nbsp;&nbsp; guarded us were they wore um they wore black&nbsp; uniforms. um some and they wore black masks,&nbsp;&nbsp; but sometimes they wore the um ultramodern SS&nbsp; uniform, which it's um it's kind of like your&nbsp;&nbsp; standard SAS Black Ops uniform. um black boots,&nbsp; black trousers, black top, but the um it has chest&nbsp;&nbsp; plates and there's leather around the arms and it&nbsp; has the um SS double rune on the double. Yeah. The&nbsp;&nbsp; the SS symbol and um so that's a modern uniform.&nbsp; When you're saying a modern uniform, you're&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about post World War II. Yeah. This is the&nbsp; the the modern SS uniform. So getting back to this&nbsp;&nbsp; SS uniform, I think what era are we talking about?&nbsp; '7s. This was 1976 and we were first taken there&nbsp;&nbsp; as babies. So that means that the that's the SS&nbsp; wearing those uniforms in Canada. So they must&nbsp;&nbsp; have authority to do so. um there was some kind of&nbsp; internal war going on in the military and in the&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence community. So is this this is um are&nbsp; you saying this is therefore a Nazi organization&nbsp;&nbsp; that's that's doing this? Um yeah. Yeah. So by by&nbsp; inference it means that the connections with AL499&nbsp;&nbsp; and the other places in the UK must be essentially&nbsp; under Nazi control or is that NSA control? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is it. You see, there's a big Nazi element&nbsp; within the NSA because this was a officially an&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA facility, the Q552 at Nelson. This was a NSA&nbsp; base officially the Q552 facility at Nelson. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, there's a there's a major Nazi element within&nbsp; the NSA. So, that essentially is saying that the&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA is a Nazi organization and a survivor&nbsp; organization from World War II. Um, yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd say that's a fairly accurate statement. So, de&nbsp; facto World War II was won by the by the Nazis. I&nbsp;&nbsp; wouldn't say they won, but I wouldn't say they&nbsp; lost either. It survived. Survived. Yeah. In&nbsp;&nbsp; an underground fashion. If the NSA is essentially&nbsp; protecting the Nazis or the Nazis are running the&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA. Yeah. Is is that what you're you're saying?&nbsp; Um I'd say that the Nazis faction is running MI6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um just to go off topic slightly before I carry&nbsp; on about what happened at the AL um Q552. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; my main contact in MI6, um, he's a director of&nbsp; special operations, a man named Alfred Bonner. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; is this your current contact or was your&nbsp; contact? He's been my contact for years&nbsp;&nbsp; and he's my current contact. I've carried out&nbsp; many assassinations under his instructions. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; so you're saying this publicly? Is this um he's&nbsp; not he's not publicly known but people can contact&nbsp;&nbsp; MI6 and ask to speak to director Bonner you can&nbsp; contact MI6 on the website the phone number and&nbsp;&nbsp; MI6 will admit they do have a director Bonner&nbsp; there so what is the function of of telling&nbsp;&nbsp; us about this now is are they inviting people&nbsp; to to ask those questions or do they want that&nbsp;&nbsp; information out they want this information out&nbsp; they want this information out um Alfred Bonner&nbsp;&nbsp; he's from Bavaria. Um German effectively. He's um&nbsp; he you see him very interesting looking man. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; you your classic Aryan giant. The guy's 6'6. Um&nbsp; looks about 52 huge guy. Skinner box. A Skinner&nbsp;&nbsp; box is um famous psychiatrist Skinner. I forget&nbsp; his first name. Um he would he designed this box&nbsp;&nbsp; and he they put babies in it and they put animals&nbsp; in with the babies and they were doing cognitive&nbsp;&nbsp; behavior test. See, now the babies would react to&nbsp; the animals and um they would in this partic this&nbsp;&nbsp; this particular device um they put us in there and&nbsp; they set up screens in the corners of the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh people's the people's faces would be put on&nbsp; the screens um enlarged and uh the faces would&nbsp;&nbsp; call us and get our attention. We'd look and the&nbsp; faces would start talking to us people and then&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the faces would look like they were um changing&nbsp; into uh half human, half whatever the animal&nbsp;&nbsp; was. So if it was a snake, if they were putting&nbsp; snakes in the pen, this the person talking would&nbsp;&nbsp; um start talking to us and then his face would&nbsp; change into half human, half snake lizard and&nbsp;&nbsp; um they George Bush senior was the main um handler&nbsp; of that particular Phil facility and um his face&nbsp;&nbsp; would often come on the screen and talk to us and&nbsp; he would do the very much the rep the reptile with&nbsp;&nbsp; the snakes. That would be his area. Was that&nbsp; something that was done on a recorded type&nbsp;&nbsp; of a level or was it he did it personally? He was&nbsp; on the screen. I'm not sure if he was that he was&nbsp;&nbsp; there sometimes physically but I mean the guy&nbsp; travels all around the world to all different&nbsp;&nbsp; bases. He's a major programmer so I don't know he&nbsp; could have been over the other side of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and he would come on and um Did this something&nbsp; you experienced directly? This Yeah, I I saw him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He used to talk to us, talk to me. And um And what&nbsp; age were you when this happened? I was this was&nbsp;&nbsp; 76. I was a baby. Yeah. And this, you know, this&nbsp; carried on. I spent from 76 to 79 there and grew&nbsp;&nbsp; up there. Um the uh Queen Mother as well, she was&nbsp; a programmer there. She would um her face would&nbsp;&nbsp; be flashed on the screen, but her specialtity was&nbsp; wolves. Whenever they put the walls in with us,&nbsp;&nbsp; um she would come on and she'd talk to us and&nbsp; um she would start to change into halfwoman,&nbsp;&nbsp; half wolf like face on the screen. Was this done&nbsp; by some kind of electronic video effect or I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know. I don't know. Um, can you name any other&nbsp; animals associated with different other people?&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, the only ones I remember is um George&nbsp; Brcina with snakes and the queen mother with&nbsp;&nbsp; um wolves. It's the place was very dark. I'm still&nbsp; starting to It's difficult to remember everything&nbsp;&nbsp; that happened there. Still coming back in bits and&nbsp; pieces. Um, I remember being put in the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp; um toy the group of babies and um there were toys&nbsp; put in and um one of the babies um took a toy off&nbsp;&nbsp; another baby and the um the little baby turned&nbsp; around and hissed at the other child like a snake&nbsp;&nbsp; and his face sort of went like a snake. So we this&nbsp; was absorbed into them psychologically or Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; into their psyche. Yeah. And with the DNA anyway&nbsp; that an anarchy DNA that the NSA were looking for. [Music] In part one, we heard how Michael&nbsp; Prince is the birth name for James Casbolt&nbsp;&nbsp; and how he was taken to a base in Canada near&nbsp; the small mountain town of Nelson in British&nbsp;&nbsp; Columbia for cyborg enhancement as mind control&nbsp; children selected by their specific blood types&nbsp;&nbsp; on how they were exposed to the open cold&nbsp; night in a large aircraft style hanger to&nbsp;&nbsp; sort out the men from the boys just as in ancient&nbsp; Sparta then guarded by Nazi SS troops. in modern&nbsp;&nbsp; type uniforms in the late 1970s. Michael sent this&nbsp; scan of one of his security clearances. However,&nbsp;&nbsp; in earlier images he sent claiming to be at&nbsp; the Dulce base, this could be anywhere. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; if anyone really knows what these forms refer&nbsp; to, please contact me at blue yonder.co.uk. What age were you when this happened? I was&nbsp; a this was 76. I was a baby. Yeah. And this,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, this carried on. I spent 76 to 79 there.&nbsp; and grew up there. Um the uh queen mother as well,&nbsp;&nbsp; she was a programmer there. She would um&nbsp; her face would be flashed on the screen,&nbsp;&nbsp; but her specialtity was wolves.&nbsp; Whenever they put the walls in with us,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, she would come on and she'd talk&nbsp; to us and, um, she would start to",

We've heard over the&nbsp;&nbsp; last 3 weeks a lecture by Dr. Colin Ross about&nbsp; the history of the CIA and military mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; experimentation programs uh documented history.&nbsp; Today we're going to start a an interview part&nbsp;&nbsp; one of a two-part interview with Dr. Colin&nbsp; Ross as we go into a bit more detail and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh explore the other many issues around this&nbsp; situation. You're listening to CKLN 88.1. I'm speaking with Dr. Colin Ross, a psychiatrist&nbsp; and researcher practicing in Dallas, Texas. And&nbsp;&nbsp; uh uh Dr. Ross, I wonder if you could just&nbsp; uh briefly describe who you are and what your&nbsp;&nbsp; current work is. Sure. I'm a Canadian by birth and&nbsp; training. I went to medical school in Edmonton and&nbsp;&nbsp; did my psychiatry training in Winnipeg. I moved&nbsp; down here to Dallas just a little over 5 years&nbsp;&nbsp; ago. I'm a specialist in multiple personality&nbsp; disorder and I've written a number of different&nbsp;&nbsp; books and lots of research papers and so on on&nbsp; that. Right now I'm working at a hospital in the&nbsp;&nbsp; Dallas area here. We have a program that we run&nbsp; on contract for the hospital which treats mostly&nbsp;&nbsp; people with multiple personality disorder. also&nbsp; uh other related disorders. Most of the people&nbsp;&nbsp; that we treat describe very traumatic and abusive&nbsp; childhoods. Now um what is a dissociative identity&nbsp;&nbsp; disorder and is it the same thing as multiple&nbsp; personality disorder? Dissociative identity&nbsp;&nbsp; disorder is the official new name for multiple&nbsp; personality disorder hasn't really caught on&nbsp;&nbsp; in the general language. It's a professional&nbsp; technical term. In 1994, that new diagnosis was&nbsp;&nbsp; introduced. It just replaces multiple personality&nbsp; disorder and the criteria for diagnosing it&nbsp;&nbsp; have been changed a little bit basically by&nbsp; adding a requirement for some type of amnesia,&nbsp;&nbsp; but basically it means the same thing as multiple&nbsp; personality. So, what does it mean when somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; has this disorder? What Well, the basic criteria&nbsp; for diagnosing are pretty straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have these different personality states or&nbsp; identities that take turns being in control of the&nbsp;&nbsp; body and there's some sort of amnesia or memory&nbsp; barrier between the different personality states.&nbsp;&nbsp; The several important points to understand about&nbsp; this disorder are first of all it's not literally&nbsp;&nbsp; true that they have different personalities.&nbsp; They just have these fragmented components of&nbsp;&nbsp; one personality and those have been referred to&nbsp; as different personalities for over 100 years but&nbsp;&nbsp; they're not literally different personalities.&nbsp; There isn't really more than one person there.&nbsp;&nbsp; And there's several different ways you can end&nbsp; up having multiple personality. One way, which is&nbsp;&nbsp; what we think we see most of the time clinically,&nbsp; is where you've basically been physically,&nbsp;&nbsp; sexually, emotionally abused or neglected as a&nbsp; child, and you create these different identities&nbsp;&nbsp; to cope with it and hold different memories and&nbsp; feelings about it and so on. And that can be,&nbsp;&nbsp; as I said, a combination of various types&nbsp; of trauma in childhood. It has to be fairly&nbsp;&nbsp; serious trauma usually. Then another way that&nbsp; you can get multiple personality is um where&nbsp;&nbsp; it's created either by mistake or deliberately by&nbsp; somebody else. And that could be in a bad therapy&nbsp;&nbsp; which is all out of control and not being handled&nbsp; properly. And then the other major way of arriving&nbsp;&nbsp; at multiple personality disorder is people&nbsp; who have what's called a factitious disorder.&nbsp;&nbsp; That means that they deliberately fake having&nbsp; it either to get into the patient role or get&nbsp;&nbsp; attention or get out of something or for some&nbsp; specific purpose. Now, have you seen this disorder&nbsp;&nbsp; occur um due to trauma as an adult or does it&nbsp; specifically happen while while a child? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's some cases reported in the literature and&nbsp; there's the odd case where it's trauma that starts&nbsp;&nbsp; in adulthood, but vast majority of time it seems&nbsp; to be childhood. Right. We've uh listened to your&nbsp;&nbsp; lecture um talking about the history of uh US mind&nbsp; control. You refer to the term yatrogenic. What&nbsp;&nbsp; does that mean? Yatrogenic is just a Greek word&nbsp; that means created by the doctor. So yatrogenic&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple personality is multiple personality&nbsp; that's created by mistake by a bad therapist&nbsp;&nbsp; who's using improper techniques. Okay. How did you&nbsp; get involved in working with people suffering from&nbsp;&nbsp; DID? Well, I actually diagnosed my first case&nbsp; when I was a medical student in Edmonton and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh just instantly found it really fascinating&nbsp; and interesting. And then when I was doing my&nbsp;&nbsp; four years of psychiatry training in Winnipeg,&nbsp; I saw one more case and I thought it was going&nbsp;&nbsp; to be too rare to really specialize in. But then&nbsp; in ' 85 when I finished my psychiatry training,&nbsp;&nbsp; I diagnosed another case and then I got some&nbsp; referrals and then more referrals and then I&nbsp;&nbsp; got a reputation for it and ended up getting lots&nbsp; of referrals from all kinds of different people in&nbsp;&nbsp; Western Canada and gradually sort of switched over&nbsp; to that being my specialty. And this this was when&nbsp;&nbsp; you were operating a practice in is it Winnipeg or&nbsp; Edmonton at the time? Yeah, Winnipeg. Right. I was&nbsp;&nbsp; a full-time uh university professor of psychiatry&nbsp; at one of the hospitals there. And and what did&nbsp;&nbsp; you find from what were your findings from working&nbsp; with people with DID or MPD? Well, I've published&nbsp;&nbsp; just on multiple personality and related things.&nbsp; I've published probably about 60 or so papers in&nbsp;&nbsp; the professional literature. So, I've found quite&nbsp; a few different things, but the main theme is&nbsp;&nbsp; really goes through the whole multiple personality&nbsp; literature. And that is that people who have this&nbsp;&nbsp; diagnosis clinically uh have lots of other things&nbsp; going on at the same time. lots of depression,&nbsp;&nbsp; lots of anxiety, drug and alcohol problems,&nbsp; eating disorder problems, sleep problems. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; they don't just have multiple personality,&nbsp; they got all kinds of different symptoms. They&nbsp;&nbsp; also tend to be in the health care system for&nbsp; quite a long period of time. Not all the time,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the majority of cases are in the health care&nbsp; system getting psychiatric treatment for one thing&nbsp;&nbsp; or another for quite a while. On average about&nbsp; uh 7 years before the multiple personality is&nbsp;&nbsp; diagnosed. And the other theme that we see going&nbsp; all the time is this childhood trauma that arises&nbsp;&nbsp; as a way of coping with childhood trauma. And then&nbsp; we just uh actually just found out this week that&nbsp;&nbsp; a paper has been accepted at the American&nbsp; Journal of Psychiatry where we assessed 103&nbsp;&nbsp; people with this diagnosis here in Dallas about&nbsp; uh almost exactly four years ago now. We gave&nbsp;&nbsp; them a whole bunch of different questionnaires&nbsp; and standardized tests and interviews and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then we followed up as many as we could two&nbsp; years later. And we were able to follow up 54 of&nbsp;&nbsp; them. And the uh reduction in all these different&nbsp; symptoms was really impressive. And 12 already in&nbsp;&nbsp; the first two years of follow-up, 12 of the 54&nbsp; people were all integrated back into one person.&nbsp;&nbsp; So they had a really dramatic and meaningful&nbsp; reduction in not just the amount of multiple&nbsp;&nbsp; personality related symptoms, but depression,&nbsp; anxiety, substance abuse, all kinds of things.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is the first uh scientifically designed&nbsp; kind of treatment outcome study that really&nbsp;&nbsp; shows that good treatment can be very helpful. So&nbsp; these people that you're talking about did undergo&nbsp;&nbsp; treatment with you or other other therapists came&nbsp; they came to our hospital usually for an average&nbsp;&nbsp; of about 17 days or so. Mhm. Uh 70% of our people&nbsp; are from outside Texas. So they're from all over&nbsp;&nbsp; the United States and we've had probably about&nbsp; 15 admissions of people from Ontario and they&nbsp;&nbsp; were then go home and are followed up by their&nbsp; therapists. So they only get about usually two,&nbsp;&nbsp; three, sometimes four weeks with us and they may&nbsp; go into our day hospital program for a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp; as well, but basically they're followed up by&nbsp; therapists all over the country. And are these&nbsp;&nbsp; therapists in contact with you in terms of um&nbsp; methods of therapy? Yeah, they've usually read&nbsp;&nbsp; my books and been to some of my workshops and&nbsp; are aware of my approach, but they don't have&nbsp;&nbsp; to necessarily follow my approach. Right. And&nbsp; these other symptoms that you were talking about,&nbsp;&nbsp; do you feel that they were also a result of&nbsp; childhood trauma? Yeah, the whole package seems&nbsp;&nbsp; to be related to childhood trauma. Uh now we got a&nbsp; lot of controversy about this going on in society&nbsp;&nbsp; in the psych psychology, psychiatry, sociology&nbsp; and so on, right? And we need a lot more research,&nbsp;&nbsp; but that's the best understanding I have right&nbsp; now. And there's fair bit of research data that&nbsp;&nbsp; backs that up. It's not totally nailed down&nbsp; scientifically. Mhm. Um, I'm wondering from&nbsp;&nbsp; your experience working in in Canada, how has the&nbsp; Canadian medical system responded to your your&nbsp;&nbsp; findings in in MPD research? Well, roughly about&nbsp; the same as American. Overall, there's a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; skepticism, a lot of political agitation, fair bit&nbsp; of negative hostile propaganda and backstabbing&nbsp;&nbsp; about it. And u, and then there's also quite a&nbsp; lot of support. And obviously if I've gotten 50&nbsp;&nbsp; or 60 professional papers published, I'm getting a&nbsp; reasonable reception. The main difference between&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada and the United States was in Canada, I just&nbsp; couldn't get the financial or clinical support to&nbsp;&nbsp; set up and run a program. And the reason that's&nbsp; possible down here is because there's a private&nbsp;&nbsp; for-profit sector in the mental health system&nbsp; that's profit driven. That's a business. and&nbsp;&nbsp; the the hospital corporation I contract with&nbsp; is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and so&nbsp;&nbsp; on. And since I attract patients, then there's a&nbsp; financial motive for the hospital to be interested&nbsp;&nbsp; in me providing that service. So that financial&nbsp; motive allows the system to sort of set aside all&nbsp;&nbsp; of these ideological and political debates that&nbsp; go on and so therefore I'm able to run a program.&nbsp;&nbsp; So for the uh survivors of childhood abuse that&nbsp; you're dealing with, I I guess they would have to&nbsp;&nbsp; have access to some kind of um funds to be able&nbsp; to undergo therapy. What what what is your sense&nbsp;&nbsp; of of uh people um that have undergone this in&nbsp; childhood that do not have access to to therapy?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the uh breakdown in terms of insurance&nbsp; coverage that we have in our program is roughly&nbsp;&nbsp; about 50% are on Medicare, which is a government&nbsp; disability program. So, they're sort of like&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian healthcare system people in that their&nbsp; health insurance is basically paid for by the&nbsp;&nbsp; government. And they also get disability welfare&nbsp; type payments for their basic support and living.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, half of our people are really insured in a way&nbsp; fairly similar to Canada. Then the other half have&nbsp;&nbsp; some sort of private insurance through their&nbsp; employers or their spouse's employers. The if&nbsp;&nbsp; you're in the one-third of people in the United&nbsp; States who don't have proper medical insurance,&nbsp;&nbsp; then you can't get proper medical care, including&nbsp; psychiatric and including the kind we provide. So&nbsp;&nbsp; that would seem to be uh probably a reason to&nbsp; think that the Canadian health care system is&nbsp;&nbsp; superior to the US. The funny thing is that if you&nbsp; have multiple personality or a related disorder,&nbsp;&nbsp; your odds of getting treatment are actually&nbsp; better in the United States because there's&nbsp;&nbsp; more programs and more therapists available. In&nbsp; Canada, even though you have universal access&nbsp;&nbsp; and universal coverage and actual practical&nbsp; reality, you can't get the treatment. So, you&nbsp;&nbsp; got theoretical universal coverage for multiple&nbsp; personality and trauma related disorders, but you&nbsp;&nbsp; don't have real practical coverage in reality.&nbsp; Well, the sort of paradox is that in the United&nbsp;&nbsp; States actually a higher percentage of people who&nbsp; could benefit from psychotherapy for all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp; problems arising from their childhoods um who&nbsp; can actually get therapy is higher in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting. Um now in your previous lecture you&nbsp; did uh go into a lot of um uh detail outlining the&nbsp;&nbsp; history of mind control. What is the link between&nbsp; MPD and mind control experimentation? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; how I got into this is a sort of a backdoor&nbsp; route. I I didn't really have any interest in&nbsp;&nbsp; the CIA or the military or mind control research&nbsp; or all of that. Particularly when I left Canada,&nbsp;&nbsp; hadn't read about it. Hadn't really heard&nbsp; any other doctors talking about it. Hadn't&nbsp;&nbsp; heard any patients talking about it. And pretty&nbsp; soon after I arrived in Texas in early 1992,&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple personality patients started talking&nbsp; about kind of real strange experiences I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; know what to make of that involved either going&nbsp; into hospitals, some sort of research setting&nbsp;&nbsp; somewhere on a military base and having different&nbsp; kinds of experiments done on them which involved&nbsp;&nbsp; um EEG machines or some kind of scientific&nbsp; equipment and sensory deprivation,&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe physical spinning, maybe hallucinogens,&nbsp; and it wasn't any kind of uh cult and obviously&nbsp;&nbsp; wasn't just their parents or something going&nbsp; on in their family. And initially I thought&nbsp;&nbsp; that was really too much to believe. But then I&nbsp; decided I should at least look into it a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit. So I started basically in early '92 doing a&nbsp; little bit of reading. And the more reading I did,&nbsp;&nbsp; what amazed me was that instead of coming to the&nbsp; conclusion, oh well, this is not possible. There's&nbsp;&nbsp; no documentation of this kind of stuff. Actually,&nbsp; the more I read, the more documentation I got that&nbsp;&nbsp; all kinds of absolutely unbelievable and bizarre&nbsp; and unethical and harmful mind control research&nbsp;&nbsp; has been done in Canada and the United States&nbsp; since the Second World War. And I've actually&nbsp;&nbsp; um interviewed and spoken with a number of people&nbsp; who have documented mind control research. Most of&nbsp;&nbsp; the patients that we work with who we hear these&nbsp; kind of things from, we get zero documentation&nbsp;&nbsp; that it's actually real. So I kind of disconnected&nbsp; my my research or my study about this from the&nbsp;&nbsp; stories I was hearing from the patients and did it&nbsp; as a separate research project. And what I've done&nbsp;&nbsp; then over the last 5 years is uh talked to lots&nbsp; of other people in the field who are interested in&nbsp;&nbsp; this. Read pretty well everything that's written&nbsp; on it. And through the Freedom of Information Act,&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got somewhere in probably in the ballpark&nbsp; of six or 7,000 pages of documents from the CIA&nbsp;&nbsp; which I've reviewed. And then I've gone to the uh&nbsp; medical school library and I've sent my secretary&nbsp;&nbsp; to five or six different places in the United&nbsp; States to go into archives in special collections&nbsp;&nbsp; and library resources and so on. So I've ended&nbsp; up now with probably more than almost two full&nbsp;&nbsp; four drawer filing cabinets full of documentation&nbsp; on all kinds of things. how I got into this and&nbsp;&nbsp; the connection with multiple personality for me&nbsp; personally was just that my multiple personality&nbsp;&nbsp; patients were the ones who started telling these&nbsp; kind of stories and got me interested in it. Right&nbsp;&nbsp; now from from a therapist point of view, how&nbsp; how do you tell if somebody is giving you an&nbsp;&nbsp; account of actual abuse or whether they're just&nbsp; fabricating something? Well, basically all the&nbsp;&nbsp; professional associations including the Canadian&nbsp; Psychiatric Association that have made statements&nbsp;&nbsp; on this and all the scientific research completely&nbsp; supports the conclusion that you can't tell. And&nbsp;&nbsp; that goes both ways. You cannot tell. You can't&nbsp; tell for sure just by listening to the patient's&nbsp;&nbsp; story. You can't tell that it's true. Also, you&nbsp; can't tell for sure that it's false. In other&nbsp;&nbsp; words, you can't tell one way or the other without&nbsp; some sort of outside proof. that is proof that&nbsp;&nbsp; it really happened or proof that it really didn't&nbsp; happen. And what I've learned in the especially in&nbsp;&nbsp; the last five years is there's really no limit to&nbsp; how detailed, how compelling, how full of feeling,&nbsp;&nbsp; how detailed a bunch of memories can be and&nbsp; be either totally real or never have happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; M I've worked with people who had really really&nbsp; really elaborate memories of all kinds of things&nbsp;&nbsp; with tremendous amount of detail and then we've&nbsp; been able to prove it never happened. Right. So&nbsp;&nbsp; that uh can't tell and that's why I decided to&nbsp; do this research kind of separated off from what&nbsp;&nbsp; the patients were telling me. right now. What&nbsp; um what uh similarities have you come across&nbsp;&nbsp; in within the survivor accounts and what you've&nbsp; discovered in the CIA documentation about their&nbsp;&nbsp; mind control programs? Well, basically, if you&nbsp; take a a typical elaborate story that you'll hear&nbsp;&nbsp; from one of multiple personality patients who have&nbsp; these kind of memories and you break it down into&nbsp;&nbsp; the elements or components of the mind control&nbsp; techniques that they describe, I've been able to&nbsp;&nbsp; document just about every one with maybe one or&nbsp; two exceptions. And all of this was carried out&nbsp;&nbsp; in a series of programs that um really began in&nbsp; the Second World War with what was called the OSS,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor&nbsp; to the CIA. Yeah. It was set up immediately after&nbsp;&nbsp; Pearl Harbor when it became obvious that there&nbsp; was a huge problem with US military intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp; gathering because they were totally surprised&nbsp; by the Japanese. And so it was set up in about&nbsp;&nbsp; 1941. And then at the end of the war, the OSS was&nbsp; disbanded. And then two years later, the personnel&nbsp;&nbsp; were rolled over into the CIA, which was created&nbsp; in September 1947 through the National Security&nbsp;&nbsp; Act. Basically the same people who had been in&nbsp; the OSS. And the OSS did various kinds of drug&nbsp;&nbsp; research and mind control research uh including&nbsp; with hallucinogens and so on and marijuana and&nbsp;&nbsp; sodiuml and so on and different types of drugs.&nbsp; Also they did experiments with hypnosis. There's&nbsp;&nbsp; um then a little bit of a gap before the CIA&nbsp; started up a series of programs in 1951. There was&nbsp;&nbsp; two programs called Artichoke and Bluebird that&nbsp; ran until about 1953 and they were rolled over&nbsp;&nbsp; into MK Ultra which ran from 1953 to 1964. Then MK&nbsp; Ultra was rolled over into MK search which ran up&nbsp;&nbsp; till 1973 and then running concurrently with MK&nbsp; Ultra and MK search. There's about roughly about&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 other programs that are declassified. There's a&nbsp; little smattering of information on each of those.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have names like MK Naomi and QK Hilltop&nbsp; and MK Delta. The the by far the best known and&nbsp;&nbsp; the one that I have the most documents on is MK&nbsp; Ultra. Mhm. It involved 149 different uh separate&nbsp;&nbsp; contracts at about 80 different institutions all&nbsp; around Canada and the United States. And in MK&nbsp;&nbsp; Naomi, MK Ultra and MK search, there's basically&nbsp; about three major blocks of types of mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; research. about uh half the projects in MK Ultra&nbsp; for instance were on some sort of procurement of&nbsp;&nbsp; chemicals, supplying chemicals or manufacturing&nbsp; chemicals which is mostly hallucinogens sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp; uh biological warfare weapons such as bacteria and&nbsp; viruses and sometimes other types of chemicals for&nbsp;&nbsp; mind control research. So it was just straight&nbsp; contracting to get the chemicals. An example of&nbsp;&nbsp; that would be in 1953, one of the MK Ultra sub&nbsp; projects, was a $400,000 grant to Eli Liy, which&nbsp;&nbsp; is the drug company that manufactures Prozac. Mhm.&nbsp; And that was for manufacturing LSD. So the the&nbsp;&nbsp; first major supplier of LSD in North America was&nbsp; actually Eli Lilly Drug Company. And and there's&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence that the CIA had uh was responsible for&nbsp; the distribution of this throughout the United&nbsp;&nbsp; States and North America. Yeah, they used it in&nbsp; actual experiments. Uh, and they also turned some&nbsp;&nbsp; of it over to the military through their MK Naomi&nbsp; program. A lot of the army mind control and drug&nbsp;&nbsp; research was done at Edgeware Arsenal, which&nbsp; has been in the news a lot recently because of&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of sexual assault and rape of female&nbsp; um, army personnel there. And it's in uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's linked to Fort Detric and Aberdine Proving&nbsp; Ground in Maryland, sort of north a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp; north of Washington DC. Is this the same military&nbsp; base that uh the BBC documentary was done about uh&nbsp;&nbsp; them giving um very powerful drugs to US soldiers?&nbsp; Yeah. Yeah. That it's was the major center for all&nbsp;&nbsp; kinds of hallucinogen and other drug research.&nbsp; Um the main one would that's best known as LSD,&nbsp;&nbsp; but actually the army released a list of about 130&nbsp; different compounds that it tested in mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; research that was released in 1975. So there's at&nbsp; least 130 different uh drugs and different types&nbsp;&nbsp; of compounds that they admit using on experimental&nbsp; subjects and they admit to um again in the mid70s&nbsp;&nbsp; they admitted to testing LSD on at least 1500&nbsp; subjects. So if you just do the arithmetic very&nbsp;&nbsp; roughly, if if they gave LSD to 1500 people and&nbsp; they tested 130 different drugs, that was just&nbsp;&nbsp; the army and you figure there's four branches of&nbsp; the military in the United States plus the CIA,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're talking about a huge number of people,&nbsp; potentially hundreds of thousands of people who&nbsp;&nbsp; got at least one dose of some experimental&nbsp; mind control drug, usually without any kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of adequate informed consent at all. Now, who&nbsp; typically would these people be? Where where are&nbsp;&nbsp; they drawing their their subjects from? Actually,&nbsp; I'd just like to pop back to um talking about Eli&nbsp;&nbsp; Liy for a second, just finish off that part of&nbsp; the story, and then I'll answer that question.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. Uh LSD was discovered accidentally in&nbsp; 1943 by a man named Albert Hoffman working at&nbsp;&nbsp; Sand Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland. Mhm. Which&nbsp; is a drug company. And uh what happened was that&nbsp;&nbsp; in the late 40s early 50s a rumor developed that&nbsp; the Russians might try to buy up the entire world&nbsp;&nbsp; supply of LSD. So that's why the CIA decided to&nbsp; contract with um the uh drug company in the United&nbsp;&nbsp; States that manufactures Prozac, which is Eli Liy,&nbsp; so they could have a secure North American supply.&nbsp;&nbsp; And one of the things that amazed me absolutely&nbsp; the most doing this background research was to&nbsp;&nbsp; find out who the original acid heads were in North&nbsp; America. Cuz you would assume it'd be beatnicks&nbsp;&nbsp; or criminals or musicians or somebody or other.&nbsp; Turns out that the original acid heads in North&nbsp;&nbsp; America were actually the psychiatrists&nbsp; and the CIA and military personnel. in in&nbsp;&nbsp; uh conferences that were financially sponsored by&nbsp; the CIA that resulted in books. I've got dozens of&nbsp;&nbsp; these psychiatrists who are some of the major drug&nbsp; researchers and major psychiatrists in the second&nbsp;&nbsp; half of the 20th century all describing the acid&nbsp; trips they were on, how much they enjoyed them,&nbsp;&nbsp; how useful they thought they were, and describing&nbsp; using LSD to treat all kinds of different things&nbsp;&nbsp; from alcoholism to anxiety to even homosexuality,&nbsp; which they considered to be a disease. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; they were themselves turning themselves and each&nbsp; other on. And then they were using all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp; different subjects. The majority would be either&nbsp; psychiatric patients who are already in treatment&nbsp;&nbsp; um army personnel, prisoners in several different&nbsp; prisons in the United States or in one project&nbsp;&nbsp; which was through MK Ultra. They actually had uh&nbsp; prostitutes that they hired through MK Ultra and&nbsp;&nbsp; they uh set up safe houses in San Francisco, New&nbsp; York. The prostitutes would go out on the street&nbsp;&nbsp; and recruit people for tricks. uh the CIA people&nbsp; would watch the tricks through one-way mirrors and&nbsp;&nbsp; monitor the sex and the prostitutes would slip&nbsp; the John's LSD and other hallucinogens and the&nbsp;&nbsp; these people were totally unaware that they were&nbsp; involved in any kind of government experiment&nbsp;&nbsp; totally unaware that they were going to get LSD&nbsp; at all. Gave no consent whatsoever. So most of the&nbsp;&nbsp; time the subjects were somebody who was one one&nbsp; notch down in the power setup. They were either an&nbsp;&nbsp; employee of the institution where the doctor was&nbsp; doing the research, they were a patient, they were&nbsp;&nbsp; um somebody in the military who loosely speaking&nbsp; volunteered but really didn't have much choice&nbsp;&nbsp; or they were prisoners. So usually was somebody&nbsp; who was under the control of the administration&nbsp;&nbsp; and under the control of the doctors somehow&nbsp; to some extent. Now, what uh specifically what&nbsp;&nbsp; prisons were involved in the uh the mind control&nbsp; experiments? Uh one of the prisons that was the&nbsp;&nbsp; New Jersey Reformatory at Bordontown, which is&nbsp; in Pennsylvania. The investigator there was Carl&nbsp;&nbsp; Feifer, who had a lot of uh MK Ultra and MK search&nbsp; money. He was also um besides being at the New&nbsp;&nbsp; Jersey neurosychiatric research institute which&nbsp; is where he did the work at Bordontown. He was the&nbsp;&nbsp; chairman of the department of pharmarmacology&nbsp; at one of the major universities in Atlanta,&nbsp;&nbsp; Emory University. And while he was there he&nbsp; did LSD experiments on people in the Atlanta&nbsp;&nbsp; uh penitentiary. Uh there was the um narcotics&nbsp; farm in Lexington, Kentucky, which was a prison&nbsp;&nbsp; that was uh mainly for drugrelated offenders.&nbsp; And then uh one of the more sinister ones is&nbsp;&nbsp; Vakavville State Prison in California. Mhm.&nbsp; Vakavville State Prison was an MK search site&nbsp;&nbsp; where they did um drug research related to the&nbsp; drug pemoline which is called Silert. The trade&nbsp;&nbsp; name is Silert. It's used for attention deficit&nbsp; disorder in kids. They were using it to study&nbsp;&nbsp; memory enhancement through drugs. And that was at&nbsp; the same time as Donald Dreeze was an inmate at&nbsp;&nbsp; Vakavville. Donald Defze was the head of the SLA&nbsp; liberation army that captured Patty Hurst. Uh at&nbsp;&nbsp; the same time that there was drug research going&nbsp; on at the New Jersey Reformatory at Bordontown,&nbsp;&nbsp; a man was then imprisoned there whose name was&nbsp; Louis Castillo and he was uh later arrested in&nbsp;&nbsp; the Philippines on suspicion of being there to&nbsp; assassinate Marcos for Nan Marcos and he exhibited&nbsp;&nbsp; uh five distinct personalities on um 40 different&nbsp; interviews conducted by the Philippines FBI.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was consultation from the Philippines FBI to&nbsp; the American FBI his case also because he alleged&nbsp;&nbsp; that he was involved in the Kennedy assassination.&nbsp; There was a consultation with uh Gerald Ford who&nbsp;&nbsp; was on the Warren Commission. So all of this&nbsp; is sort of tied into all kinds of aspects of&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole second half of the 20th century.&nbsp; This very very twisted convoluted history.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mhm. people who um were the expert witnesses&nbsp; for Patty Hurst uh who were saying that she&nbsp;&nbsp; had been captured by the Simines Liberation Army&nbsp; and brainwashed by them using the mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; techniques of destructive cults which are very&nbsp; similar to the mind control techniques of the&nbsp;&nbsp; CIA military mind control. The those witnesses&nbsp; included uh Robert Lifton, Margaret Singer,&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin, and a psychiatrist named Jolly West. and&nbsp; Jolly West and Martin Orin were had top secret&nbsp;&nbsp; clearance and had MK Ultra money. Their testimony&nbsp; about Patty Hurst was that a new identity named&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanya had been created through these brainwashing&nbsp; techniques and Patty Hurst identified herself as&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanya when she robbed a bank. She was convicted&nbsp; and found guilty and actually sentenced to jail&nbsp;&nbsp; for that. So the uh experts in a lot of the CIA&nbsp; mind control programming were very aware of the&nbsp;&nbsp; possibility of creating an artificial multiple&nbsp; personality through mind control techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp; And they testified that this had been done by this&nbsp; character Donald Defreeze who was a black criminal&nbsp;&nbsp; who was basically a petty criminal and thief. The&nbsp; there's several strange twists of that story. Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the strange twists which is somewhat&nbsp; documented but not completely documented is&nbsp;&nbsp; that Donald Def's according to several different&nbsp; sources and according to Patty Hurst uh biography&nbsp;&nbsp; as well was actually an employee of the CIA during&nbsp; the Vietnam War who's a psychological warfare oh&nbsp;&nbsp; sorry there's a not Donald Dere himself another&nbsp; man named Coloulston Westbrook was an employee of&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the CIA full-time and was a psychological&nbsp; warfare expert in Vietnam camp and according&nbsp;&nbsp; to these several different books, he came back&nbsp; uh and got a job at the University of Berkeley&nbsp;&nbsp; as a language instructor. And then he entered&nbsp; Vakavville prison under cover of the Black&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultural Association, which was a black prisoners&nbsp; and inmates program. And undercover of that black&nbsp;&nbsp; cultural association, he used mind control&nbsp; techniques on Donald Defreeze and actually&nbsp;&nbsp; gave him his code name of Sank and designed the&nbsp; seven-headed Cobra logo of the Symbian Liberation&nbsp;&nbsp; Army. Then Donald Dreeze was transferred&nbsp; from a maximum security facility at VAC,&nbsp;&nbsp; namely Vakavville to a low security facility from&nbsp; which he immediately escaped and several months&nbsp;&nbsp; after then captured Patty Hurst and used fairly&nbsp; sophisticated mind control techniques on her and&nbsp;&nbsp; created this Manurion candidate second identity&nbsp; bank robber and her named Tanya. So unless all of&nbsp;&nbsp; this is highly coincidental, um what you're saying&nbsp; is that the SLA was a CIA creation. That's I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know for a documented fact that that's true, but&nbsp; um that's what these several different books are&nbsp;&nbsp; alleging and the information is fairly detailed&nbsp; and I'm trying to research up on that. But it's&nbsp;&nbsp; absolutely known for a fact that um these do&nbsp; two doctors, Dr. West and Dr. Or had extensive&nbsp;&nbsp; uh funding from all branches of military and and&nbsp; he published off starting in 1943 and going all&nbsp;&nbsp; the way up to 1971 very very detailed accounts&nbsp; of creating multiple personality during the&nbsp;&nbsp; Second World War for uh various branches of the&nbsp; US military. And basically these people were he&nbsp;&nbsp; called them multiple personality. uh he talked&nbsp; about the multiple personality literature and he&nbsp;&nbsp; referred to them as super spies. So the the idea&nbsp; is that you create somebody artificially using&nbsp;&nbsp; hypnosis and other mind control techniques who&nbsp; had no multiple personality before but now has&nbsp;&nbsp; this second identity and the second identity&nbsp; is hidden behind a memory barrier or amnesia&nbsp;&nbsp; barrier and there's a verbal access code that's&nbsp; used to call out the second identity. And so now,&nbsp;&nbsp; say the person is a marine, they'll be given&nbsp; some kind of a courier assignment to take some&nbsp;&nbsp; documents say to Tokyo, but GHS then calls out the&nbsp; second personality and sticks in some classified&nbsp;&nbsp; information into the second personality. The then&nbsp; there's a switch back to the main identity. The&nbsp;&nbsp; person is just going on this routine trip to take&nbsp; some sort of documents or technical materials over&nbsp;&nbsp; to Tokyo. when it gets to the far end then uh he&nbsp; uses the example of a Colonel Brown. Colonel Brown&nbsp;&nbsp; in Tokyo then uses the code signal and the example&nbsp; that he gives and one of the description is that&nbsp;&nbsp; this Colonel Brown says the moon is clear. As&nbsp; soon as he says the moon is clear then the other&nbsp;&nbsp; identity pops out gives the classified message.&nbsp; Colonel Brown inserts a classified response. Then&nbsp;&nbsp; the person pops back to their regular identity,&nbsp; goes back home and thinks that they've just been&nbsp;&nbsp; on a routine assignment. But Esther Brooks again&nbsp; says the moon is clear. The identity comes out&nbsp;&nbsp; and Esther Brooks gets the classified message&nbsp; from this Colonel Brown. So he describes using&nbsp;&nbsp; these people in hypnotic uh courier u missions&nbsp; and for actual operations extensively many times&nbsp;&nbsp; during the second world war. So this is in George&nbsp; Eterbrook's own documentation that he's describing&nbsp;&nbsp; this right and he also describes using them for in&nbsp; infiltration operations. So the idea there is you&nbsp;&nbsp; take somebody who's a loyal patriotic marine and&nbsp; you create in them a new identity of a communist&nbsp;&nbsp; and you submerge the previous identity of the&nbsp; patriotic marine. Now this person who's a a really&nbsp;&nbsp; diehard communist goes and infiltrates various&nbsp; communist cells or political organizations or&nbsp;&nbsp; does whatever spy work is required. And the idea&nbsp; is if one of these couriers or these infiltration&nbsp;&nbsp; agents is captured and interrogated, they actually&nbsp; have no idea that they're spies. They genuinely&nbsp;&nbsp; think they're either on just a routine mission or&nbsp; they generally believe that they're communists. So&nbsp;&nbsp; then they can't be interrogated and they can't&nbsp; be uh made to reveal information so easily.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then what of course they go in and they&nbsp; do whatever infiltration operation is required&nbsp;&nbsp; and then they come back and they're debriefed by&nbsp; Esther Brooks who knows how to get through to the&nbsp;&nbsp; original personality and some of these people are&nbsp; actually g according to Esther Brooks were given&nbsp;&nbsp; dishonorable discharges as part of their cover.&nbsp; Now one question about that is is Etorbrooks&nbsp;&nbsp; just telling tall tales? Well, I've been able to&nbsp; build up a lot of documentation about him and his&nbsp;&nbsp; uh personal archives are still housed at this&nbsp; Colgate College. I photocopied probably what&nbsp;&nbsp; would be a pile of paper at least a foot deep. And&nbsp; what did that those documents reveal to you? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's all his personal papers, correspondence,&nbsp; background, and so I've got uh actual original&nbsp;&nbsp; documents photocopied now showing that he in&nbsp; fact was employed by the War Department during&nbsp;&nbsp; the Second World War. um he uh marketed his ideas&nbsp; to every branch of military intelligence in the&nbsp;&nbsp; United States. There's tons of correspondents&nbsp; with him from all kinds of navy, army, air force&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence people. Uh he did a lot of training&nbsp; at Fort Hullird and other locations. Um, and one&nbsp;&nbsp; of the most interesting things about him is that&nbsp; he corresponded pretty regularly with Jay Edgar&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoover from the 1930s through into the 1960s. He&nbsp; had a lot of correspondence with Jed Garoover.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a lot of FBI personnel who came out and&nbsp; visited him, attended his different teachings and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh a lot of these people talked about reading&nbsp; his textbook which came out in 1943 that's called&nbsp;&nbsp; hypnotism and in that textbook he describes&nbsp; these um artificial multiple personalities in&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of detail. I've got good documentation of&nbsp; the CIA in Bluebird and Artichoke did pretty much&nbsp;&nbsp; the same experiments. They describe several&nbsp; different things. They they don't describe&nbsp;&nbsp; actual operations, but they describe real life&nbsp; simulations where they're testing these people.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, they describe the same thing that Sbrooks is&nbsp; talking about where they uh hypnotize somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; and condition them and create a second identity&nbsp; that can stand up on to a lie detector test.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, they describe creating amnesia barriers&nbsp; and having people go on assignments where they&nbsp;&nbsp; go into another building and rifle through&nbsp; some materials and take some documents and&nbsp;&nbsp; bring them back and then have no memory of doing&nbsp; that whatsoever. And uh in MK Ultra there was a&nbsp;&nbsp; contractor named Alden Sears who did experiments&nbsp; at the University of Minnesota and the University&nbsp;&nbsp; of Denver which were very similar and there's&nbsp; a lot of documentation of him uh procuring CIA&nbsp;&nbsp; safe houses for some of his experiments coming and&nbsp; doing demonstrations of these kind of techniques&nbsp;&nbsp; for military and CIA personnel and uh creating&nbsp; hypnotic couriers and so on. So there's several&nbsp;&nbsp; sets of documents that back up that this was done&nbsp; at an experimental level by the CIA successfully,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I don't have documents about their use in&nbsp; operations. Now you mentioned that there were&nbsp;&nbsp; three areas of of interest in the mind control&nbsp; experimentation. Um wonder if we could just review&nbsp;&nbsp; those again. You you mentioned drugs. A big chunk&nbsp; was just uh manufacturing and supplying drugs,&nbsp;&nbsp; chemicals, and biological weapons. Another uh&nbsp; large chunk was actually using the drugs in&nbsp;&nbsp; experiments on people to try and create amnesia&nbsp; to create altered states of consciousness to test&nbsp;&nbsp; the drugs for interrogation purposes and also to&nbsp; test them for detecting hypnotically programmed&nbsp;&nbsp; agents. There was a team called the Artichoke team&nbsp; that was created as part of Project Artichoke that&nbsp;&nbsp; would use different chemical and mind control&nbsp; sensor deprivation techniques to try and figure&nbsp;&nbsp; out if somebody had been hypnotically programmed&nbsp; by another intelligence agency. In other words,&nbsp;&nbsp; they were trying to pick up these hypnotically&nbsp; controlled double agents that had been created&nbsp;&nbsp; either by the KGB or whoever. Then about a quarter&nbsp; of the research projects were just kind of odds&nbsp;&nbsp; and ends of all different types, different&nbsp; psychology and sociology experiments. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; a man named R. Gordon Wson who wrote a book&nbsp; called Soma, the divine mushroom of immortality,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is about that uh toad stool that you always&nbsp; see in fairy tales, which has got a white stock&nbsp;&nbsp; and a red cap with white flexcks on it. That's&nbsp; a mushroom ammonita mascara. It's a hallucinagen&nbsp;&nbsp; that was used by circumpolar shamans in both&nbsp; uh northern Canada, Alaska, and Siberia for&nbsp;&nbsp; centuries. So this R. Gordon Wson, who called this&nbsp; mushroom soma, divine mushroom of immortality,&nbsp;&nbsp; he had an MK Ultra grant through JP Morgan company&nbsp; to go on an expedition to northern Mexico to try&nbsp;&nbsp; and find hallucenic mushrooms. And just to give&nbsp; you an example of how all these things kind of tie&nbsp;&nbsp; into our culture at large, J. Chester Brooks gave&nbsp; uh three or four major symposia that he set up at&nbsp;&nbsp; Colgate College and he invited all kinds of people&nbsp; to them which included Martin Or um in one of the&nbsp;&nbsp; actually two of the different uh conferences&nbsp; or symposia that he put on Aldis Huxley came&nbsp;&nbsp; and talked and Aldis Huxley used hallucinogens&nbsp; himself and wrote the novel the brave new world&nbsp;&nbsp; in the brave new world which is a science fiction&nbsp; book, the government controls the people by giving&nbsp;&nbsp; them a mind control drug called soma. So all these&nbsp; things are kind of very strangely interconnected&nbsp;&nbsp; with each other. Not as part of a huge conspiracy,&nbsp; but just because all these people knew each other,&nbsp;&nbsp; talked to each other, influenced and affected each&nbsp; other. One of the um purposes of a lot of the sub&nbsp;&nbsp; projects, four of the MK Ultra sub projects were&nbsp; on children and three of those investigators knew&nbsp;&nbsp; that it was did not know it was CIA money and&nbsp; one did know it was CIA money. But the research&nbsp;&nbsp; projects themselves were pretty bland and not very&nbsp; alarming. So the purpose there as stated by the&nbsp;&nbsp; CIA is not really the research as such. One of&nbsp; them MKlra sub project 103 was at the children's&nbsp;&nbsp; international summer camp in Maine and it was a&nbsp; camp basically where children from all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp; different countries would come and spend uh weeks&nbsp; or a summer and the purpose of the research was to&nbsp;&nbsp; study how children communicate and solve problems&nbsp; when they don't share a common language but the&nbsp;&nbsp; purpose of the CIA funding which was secret was&nbsp; that they wanted to establish contact with a&nbsp;&nbsp; whole bunch of foreign international children who&nbsp; were as young as 11 years old because they might&nbsp;&nbsp; be of potential intelligence use in the future. In&nbsp; other words, they were just interested in getting&nbsp;&nbsp; an inn so they could make a list of people&nbsp; and start figuring out who might be an good&nbsp;&nbsp; person to recruit for whatever CIA purpose in the&nbsp; future. And they were doing this with really just&nbsp;&nbsp; children. Now you also you mentioned that um uh&nbsp; multiple personalities are much easily much more&nbsp;&nbsp; easily created um within children and if the&nbsp; um uh if the military and CIA's um goals were&nbsp;&nbsp; to use multiple personalities for intelligence&nbsp; purposes um is there evidence of experimentation&nbsp;&nbsp; on children? uh not experimentation to&nbsp; create multiple personality directly,&nbsp;&nbsp; but there's experiments on children that were&nbsp; you would think were totally un unbelievable,&nbsp;&nbsp; impossible, could never happen. And if if you&nbsp; heard somebody telling you about them, you just&nbsp;&nbsp; think the person was making it up or was diluted,&nbsp; but actually I have the publications that describe&nbsp;&nbsp; the research. One thing is that GH Esster Brooks&nbsp; himself did some kind of hypnosis experiments on&nbsp;&nbsp; children at two different orphanages in northern&nbsp; New York. So he did create multiple personality&nbsp;&nbsp; experimentally. He did correspond with Jed&nbsp; Garoover about using hypnosis and drugs&nbsp;&nbsp; on juvenile offenders and he did actually do&nbsp; some kind of research at these two orphanages,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I don't know the exact nature of the research&nbsp; except that it involved hypnosis in some form.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if if you think this is too much to believe,&nbsp; there's no way that the CIA, the military would&nbsp;&nbsp; do experiments to create multiple personality&nbsp; in children. That's just too off-the-wall and&nbsp;&nbsp; too bizarre. Uh it'd be helpful if you know what&nbsp; actually is documented and what actually was done.&nbsp;&nbsp; And one of the most revered psychiatrists who had&nbsp; her obituary in the American Journal of Psychiatry&nbsp;&nbsp; recently is a woman named Loretta Bender. She was&nbsp; a child psychiatrist and you could interview any&nbsp;&nbsp; child psychiatrist around the country and he would&nbsp; speak in glowing terms about her contribution to&nbsp;&nbsp; child psychiatry. In a publication uh that I have&nbsp; on file that I photocopied that you can just get&nbsp;&nbsp; at the medical school library. It's not hard&nbsp; to get. She describes giving LSD in uh dosages&nbsp;&nbsp; of 150 micrograms which is a big street level dose&nbsp; for a kid to children aged 5 to 10 for days, weeks&nbsp;&nbsp; and sometimes months in a row. She also described&nbsp; giving hallucinogenic doses of psilocybin which&nbsp;&nbsp; is the main compound in magic mushrooms to kids&nbsp; as young as 5 years of age. So this network of&nbsp;&nbsp; doctors whose drugs were supplied either by&nbsp; the CIA or the military or by drug companies&nbsp;&nbsp; funded by the CIA and the military gave massive&nbsp; doses of LSD and other hallucinogens to kids&nbsp;&nbsp; uh five 6 7 8 years old and they would keep them&nbsp; on uh full acid trips up to months in a row. And&nbsp;&nbsp; this was documented in the journals at the time.&nbsp; Yeah, it was published in the reg regular medical&nbsp;&nbsp; journals. You can just go to the library and&nbsp; photocopy. And there was no outcry in the in the&nbsp;&nbsp; profession against this. I mean, this sounds like&nbsp; torture. No, it was just regarded as psychiatrist&nbsp;&nbsp; doing research and trying to help kids. That's&nbsp; the thing that's most amazing about all of this&nbsp;&nbsp; is you don't have to have a conspiracy theory. Uh,&nbsp; and really conspiracy theories are interesting,&nbsp;&nbsp; but kind of beside the point. I think the thing&nbsp; that's most amazing is that all this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff is just straightforward everyday regular&nbsp; activity of psychiatrists and psychologists. It&nbsp;&nbsp; gets published. It gets presented at conferences&nbsp; and nobody comments on it or gets outraged about&nbsp;&nbsp; it or does anything about it. Incredible. Another&nbsp; thing, another type of research that's fully&nbsp;&nbsp; documented and again if you know the references,&nbsp; any medical school library has these references on&nbsp;&nbsp; file and you can go and photocopy them. There's&nbsp; a whole body of research on brain electrode&nbsp;&nbsp; implants. The main people who were doing that were&nbsp; um this Jolly West tried to set up a program in&nbsp;&nbsp; u Los Angeles to do that which was approved&nbsp; by Ronald Reagan but then got shut down by&nbsp;&nbsp; public protest. The main work was done at Tlane&nbsp; University in New Orleans by Robert Heath, at Yale&nbsp;&nbsp; by Joseé Delgato and at Harvard by a team that&nbsp; included Frank Irvin and William. So these are the&nbsp;&nbsp; the major universities in the western world. What&nbsp; they basically did was they would stick very fine&nbsp;&nbsp; electrodes into a human being's brain often up&nbsp; to 15 20 25 electrodes at one time and they would&nbsp;&nbsp; stick them in specific centers in the brain or&nbsp; specific areas in the brain. And then they would&nbsp;&nbsp; stimulate the electrodes electrically through&nbsp; wires and that would cause the electrode to&nbsp;&nbsp; discharge which would cause that part of the brain&nbsp; to fire. And then uh Joseé Delgado at Yale made a&nbsp;&nbsp; technical advance which was he invented a remote&nbsp; transmitter box that in the 1960s had a range of&nbsp;&nbsp; up to 100 ft. So he could push a button on the&nbsp; box that would transmit a signal to the electrode.&nbsp;&nbsp; There'd be a firing of the electrode and that part&nbsp; of the brain would then get activated. And in the&nbsp;&nbsp; u books and the papers that are published, he&nbsp; describes also doing this in cats and in monkeys.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he refers to these monkeys as mechanical toys&nbsp; because he could control their body movements and&nbsp;&nbsp; control their behavior. An example of what he did&nbsp; with monkeys was he had uh a group of monkeys who&nbsp;&nbsp; are all in the same species living in a large&nbsp; cage. And they have a dominance hierarchy. That&nbsp;&nbsp; is they have a boss monkey who runs the whole show&nbsp; and then they have a whole bunch of submissive&nbsp;&nbsp; males and females. And in the normal setup, the&nbsp; boss monkey has half the cage to himself and all&nbsp;&nbsp; the other monkeys get to use the other half. And&nbsp; if they try and come in his space, then he gets&nbsp;&nbsp; mad or gets angry or beats them up or threatens&nbsp; them or whatever. And this is just the sort of no&nbsp;&nbsp; normal social structure of these monkey troops.&nbsp; What he did then was he implanted an electrode&nbsp;&nbsp; in the brain of the boss monkey. And when he&nbsp; pushed a certain button on his transmitter box,&nbsp;&nbsp; the boss monkey became completely passive. And so&nbsp; the other monkeys started to figure this out and&nbsp;&nbsp; would start getting bold and would come into his&nbsp; part of the cage and would rough him up and not&nbsp;&nbsp; pay attention to him. And so the next step in the&nbsp; experiments was he put a lever in the actual cage&nbsp;&nbsp; that the different monkeys could get their hands&nbsp; on. They could press the lever. When they pressed&nbsp;&nbsp; the lever, it then transmitted a signal to the&nbsp; electrode in the boss monkeyy's brain, making him&nbsp;&nbsp; be passive. So the other monkeys learned this. So&nbsp; the other monkeys started practicing mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; on the boss monkey by pressing the lever to make&nbsp; him have these seizures in this part of the brain&nbsp;&nbsp; that made him passive. They actually learned&nbsp; how to control the boss monkey. And it shows&nbsp;&nbsp; a picture of the other monkeys all over the cage&nbsp; and not paying any attention to the boss monkey&nbsp;&nbsp; at all. What he did then was he did this in human&nbsp; beings, including children. And he describes an&nbsp;&nbsp; 11-year-old boy that he put brain electrodes in.&nbsp; And when he pressed the uh the right button on&nbsp;&nbsp; the box, the boy would start talking about&nbsp; maybe being a girl and would start talking&nbsp;&nbsp; about wanting to marry a male therapist. So they&nbsp; were using brain electrol implants to modify the&nbsp;&nbsp; identity and the worldview and the behavior of&nbsp; uh children as young as 11. Incredible. Robert&nbsp;&nbsp; Heath who who did the same sort of stuff at Tulain&nbsp; University. There's a he actually describes the&nbsp;&nbsp; same case in several different publications and&nbsp; the guy's referred to as subject B19 and he was&nbsp;&nbsp; uh I forget if he was 18 or 20. He was in around&nbsp; 1820 maybe 19 and he was a homosexual guy and they&nbsp;&nbsp; viewed homosexuality as a medical disease which&nbsp; needed to be treated. So they put brain electrodes&nbsp;&nbsp; in this guy, one of which went into the area of&nbsp; the brain called the septum, which was one of the&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure centers of the brain. And then they would&nbsp; push the button uh which would cause the electrode&nbsp;&nbsp; to fire. And he would not have excuse me, not have&nbsp; a full orgasm, but would be sort of 3/4 of the way&nbsp;&nbsp; to orgasm, feeling really really good as a result&nbsp; of the button being pushed. And they they kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of studied that and practiced it. And while they&nbsp; were pushing the box, they would get him to watch&nbsp;&nbsp; heterosexual pornography films so that he would&nbsp; be experiencing a near orgasm while he's watching&nbsp;&nbsp; heterosexual pornography. They were trying to&nbsp; switch him over to being interested in women. And&nbsp;&nbsp; then they did two further things. They set him&nbsp; up with a little box of his own where he could&nbsp;&nbsp; push the button on the box himself. And they have&nbsp; a chart of different three-hour periods and they&nbsp;&nbsp; show how many times he pushed the button himself.&nbsp; He in one three-hour period got up to pushing the&nbsp;&nbsp; button 1500 times to give himself an artificial&nbsp; near orgasm. And then the final step they did in&nbsp;&nbsp; the research was they brought in a 20-year-old&nbsp; prostitute. This is to the medical school and&nbsp;&nbsp; had her have sex with him. And while they were&nbsp; having sex, they recorded the brain electrode&nbsp;&nbsp; output because they it was a two-way communication&nbsp; system. they could send a signal to the guy's&nbsp;&nbsp; brain to fire off that part of the brain or they&nbsp; could just use the electrodes to monitor the brain&nbsp;&nbsp; activity that was going on naturally. So they&nbsp; actually took brain electrode activity recordings&nbsp;&nbsp; from deep inside his brain while he was having an&nbsp; orgasm with this female prostitute. And then they&nbsp;&nbsp; report that over an 11-month period of follow-up,&nbsp; he was mostly heterosexual with a few relapses.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is just the the stuff that really went on.&nbsp; A guy at uh Harvard who was part of the Harvard&nbsp;&nbsp; brain electrode team, his name was William. He&nbsp; was um testifying at the recent hearings and&nbsp;&nbsp; there was a committee set up by Bill Clinton&nbsp; to look into all the radiation experiments.&nbsp;&nbsp; The radiation experiments are all intertwined&nbsp; and overlap with all this mind control stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; And Williamu, who was part of the brain electrode&nbsp; team at Harvard, described injecting plutonium&nbsp;&nbsp; into people at Harvard as part of um atomic energy&nbsp; commission military and CIA radiation research.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he claimed that all of the subjects there gave&nbsp; informed consent. But one of the subjects who was&nbsp;&nbsp; named HP12, I think HP was initials for human&nbsp; product. So they referred to their experimental&nbsp;&nbsp; subjects as human product and then they would&nbsp; have a series of numbers. So this guy was HP12.&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived at the emergency department at one of&nbsp; the Boston hospitals which was part of the Harvard&nbsp;&nbsp; system unconscious and unidentified. He was&nbsp; injected with plutonium obviously without giving&nbsp;&nbsp; informed consent. And he died uh without regaining&nbsp; consciousness and without being identified. So&nbsp;&nbsp; that didn't quite fit with the idea that everybody&nbsp; gave informed consent. Mhm. And uh recently the uh&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinton government uh approved a settlement of 4.8&nbsp; million for just 12 of these plutonium subjects.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's probably hundreds and hundreds and&nbsp; hundreds of them. And this was the outcome of the&nbsp;&nbsp; presidential hearing on radiation experiments. But&nbsp; what I think and what I'm going to start logging&nbsp;&nbsp; for is that there should be another hearing on&nbsp; the mind control side of things. Right. and uh&nbsp;&nbsp; the mind control experiments were introduced uh&nbsp; at the end of um the hearings. Um can you can you&nbsp;&nbsp; talk about that? What what evidence was introduced&nbsp; and what the response was by the US government?&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a number of different people. It was a&nbsp; typical uh kind of presidential commission which&nbsp;&nbsp; is like the various commissions of inquiry that&nbsp; go on in Canada where they receive all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp; mail and correspondents and then they go around&nbsp; the country having hearings that anybody can&nbsp;&nbsp; testify at and they had hearings in Washington&nbsp; that people went down to. So there's a number of&nbsp;&nbsp; people who testified about um two aspects of this.&nbsp; the documented stuff like I've been describing and&nbsp;&nbsp; then the memories of individual patients of&nbsp; stuff that they claim has gone on which isn't&nbsp;&nbsp; documented. So the the things that uh I know for&nbsp; sure went on and include that includes went on in&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada were use of hallucinogens uh implantation&nbsp; of these brain electrodes massive uses of electric&nbsp;&nbsp; shock and that's electric shock is an ECT&nbsp; treatment to make you have a seizure and also&nbsp;&nbsp; just electric shock to different parts of your&nbsp; body as part of behavior modification. um sensory&nbsp;&nbsp; deprivation experiments where people were kept in&nbsp; chambers for uh long periods of time until they&nbsp;&nbsp; started hallucinating. Um uh you Cameron who's&nbsp; the best known CIA contractor in Cameron did a&nbsp;&nbsp; what's called psychic driving where he would make&nbsp; people listen to tape loops for literally hours&nbsp;&nbsp; and hours and hours and hours and hours per day&nbsp; with repeated messages trying to modify their way&nbsp;&nbsp; of thinking. So all of these different elements&nbsp; have been used absolutely totally documented in&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff that's published in medical school library&nbsp; type journals. Mhm. One of my sort of favorite and&nbsp;&nbsp; most bizarre series of experiments like that was&nbsp; done at the University of Minnesota by a man named&nbsp;&nbsp; Amado Morazzi who had an Air Force grant for LSD&nbsp; research while at the University of Minnesota and&nbsp;&nbsp; previous to that he was the uh one of the sort&nbsp; of administrative managerial guys at Edgeware&nbsp;&nbsp; Arsenal for their mind control research. uh he&nbsp; besides just giving people LSD and so on he made&nbsp;&nbsp; use of what's called the Ames leaf room that's&nbsp; am a guy named Ames developed this room funded&nbsp;&nbsp; by the office of naval research which is heavily&nbsp; involved in all this mind control research themes&nbsp;&nbsp; leaf room is uh has different forms can either&nbsp; be a room that's usually built out of plywood&nbsp;&nbsp; that's got walls that are at all kinds of weird&nbsp; angles or this particular room was cubic So it's&nbsp;&nbsp; a just a normal shaped kind of cube and you would&nbsp; sit inside the room stuck one side would have no&nbsp;&nbsp; wall at all. It would be open and that's a side&nbsp; that you would be looking into and you would be&nbsp;&nbsp; sitting just inside the room so that you couldn't&nbsp; see anything except the walls and then the entire&nbsp;&nbsp; room was lined with leaves. So leaves were glued&nbsp; to all the walls. So there you are in this sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of environment where you can't exactly see where&nbsp; the corners are because of all these leaves. And&nbsp;&nbsp; then when you're in the Ames leaf room either in&nbsp; the research by Ames or this guy at University of&nbsp;&nbsp; Minnesota, you would put on special glasses called&nbsp; anchonic lenses. And the anoconic lenses would&nbsp;&nbsp; distort all of the angles. So like the ceiling&nbsp; would be sort of coming down at you. The floor&nbsp;&nbsp; would be slam sliding some other weird angle. One&nbsp; wall would be coming in at you and the other wall&nbsp;&nbsp; going away. The leaves on one side of the room&nbsp; would be all big and coming out at you and the&nbsp;&nbsp; leaves on the other side would be kind of flat and&nbsp; receding. And all of the different perspectives&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't fit together properly. And then the subject&nbsp; who's sitting in there looking through these&nbsp;&nbsp; lenses has a little control mechanism to control&nbsp; a bar that's at the far end of the room to try and&nbsp;&nbsp; set it to horizontal. And it shows a photograph of&nbsp; this guy sitting in there and the bar is like at a&nbsp;&nbsp; 40° angle, but he thinks it's horizontal. And then&nbsp; the extra twist that Morazzi did was while he had&nbsp;&nbsp; these people sitting in the Ames leaf room with&nbsp; these weird goggles on, he gave them LSD. That's&nbsp;&nbsp; all done on Air Force contracts. So this is pretty&nbsp; weird and bizarre stuff. Yeah. Um what uh what if&nbsp;&nbsp; any was the US government's response to the test&nbsp; specifically the mind control experimentation&nbsp;&nbsp; testimony at the um hearings on uh radiation?&nbsp; Uh they just kind of acknowledged it and really&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't comment or do much of anything with it. So&nbsp; nothing has been done to follow up. Not nothing&nbsp;&nbsp; systematic that I'm aware of. No. Right. I just&nbsp; want to go back to uh when you were talking about&nbsp;&nbsp; brain implants. Um, have you have you or other&nbsp; therapists come across direct evidence of implants&nbsp;&nbsp; in clients? Uh, nothing really conclusive. There's&nbsp; kind of a a conspiracy literature about that that&nbsp;&nbsp; exists that you can see find on the internet&nbsp; and find in various publications and so on where&nbsp;&nbsp; people will show x-rays and they there always&nbsp; is somewhere in the x-ray what is supposed to&nbsp;&nbsp; be an implant but it's kind of vague usually&nbsp; and not really absolutely documented. I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; think that's because it's not going on. I think&nbsp; it's just because the documentation hasn't been&nbsp;&nbsp; fished out yet. I haven't myself uh had a patient&nbsp; who comes in for treatment and I've been able to&nbsp;&nbsp; document that there's implants in this person's&nbsp; brain. So the documented evidence indicates that&nbsp;&nbsp; they're able to use implants for control purposes&nbsp; and also to receive information from a person's&nbsp;&nbsp; brain. Is that correct? Guy Jolly West who is the&nbsp; expert witness for uh Patty Hurst who is also the&nbsp;&nbsp; military and CIA contractor who's an expert on&nbsp; multiple personality and different things. He&nbsp;&nbsp; actually mentions multiple personality in his CIA&nbsp; MK Ultra proposal. uh he tried to set up this UCLA&nbsp;&nbsp; violence center that was going to be funded by&nbsp; Ronald Reagan and Frank Irvin from the Harvard&nbsp;&nbsp; brain electrode implant team was going to come and&nbsp; one of the uh things that was going to be done at&nbsp;&nbsp; the UCLA violence project and also was going to&nbsp; be done at Vakavville State Prison under separate&nbsp;&nbsp; administrative structure but which got shut down&nbsp; by public protest was they were going to implant&nbsp;&nbsp; brain electrodes in violent uh sex offenders and&nbsp; then they were going to do two things. They were&nbsp;&nbsp; going to use the electrodes as kind of like a&nbsp; electronic bracelet inside the person's head. So&nbsp;&nbsp; they were going to monitor the person's location&nbsp; because of transmissions from the implanted&nbsp;&nbsp; electrodes and then they would know if the person&nbsp; had gone out of this is after their discharge&nbsp;&nbsp; from prison. They would know if the person had&nbsp; gone outside their restricted area. Also they&nbsp;&nbsp; would be able to monitor the person's level of&nbsp; sexual arousal through the brain electrodes.&nbsp;&nbsp; So if the guy was outside his restricted area&nbsp; and was starting to get sexually aroused, what&nbsp;&nbsp; they would do would be then transmit a signal to&nbsp; him that would just paralyze him. And one of the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh things that was going to be done at the&nbsp; UCLA violence project and also was going to be&nbsp;&nbsp; done at Vakavville State Prison under a separate&nbsp; administrative structure but which got shut down&nbsp;&nbsp; by public protest was they were going to implant&nbsp; brain electrodes in violent uh sex offenders and&nbsp;&nbsp; then they were going to do two things. They were&nbsp; going to use the electrodes as kind of like a&nbsp;&nbsp; electronic bracelet inside the person's head. So&nbsp; they were going to monitor the person's location&nbsp;&nbsp; because of transmissions from the implanted&nbsp; electrodes and then they would know if the person&nbsp;&nbsp; had gone out of this is after their discharge&nbsp; from prison. They would know if the person had&nbsp;&nbsp; gone outside their restricted area. Also they&nbsp; would be able to monitor the person's level of&nbsp;&nbsp; sexual arousal through the brain electrodes. And&nbsp; so if the guy was outside his restricted area and&nbsp;&nbsp; was starting to get sexually aroused, what they&nbsp; would do would be then transmit a signal to him&nbsp;&nbsp; that would just paralyze him, just make him like&nbsp; go catatonic or stop in his tracks and not move.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then they would notify the police who would&nbsp; go pick him up. And the there's a book called&nbsp;&nbsp; Violence in the Brain by two of these Harvard&nbsp; brain electrode people. and they discuss maybe&nbsp;&nbsp; using these kind of electrodes to deal with people&nbsp; who are w rioting like the Watts riots and so on&nbsp;&nbsp; that were going on at that time. So there was a&nbsp; whole scheme about how we were going to control&nbsp;&nbsp; bad people in the population that we didn't&nbsp; like and and this is their own uh literature&nbsp;&nbsp; and own documentation that uh you're getting&nbsp; this information from. This is all completely&nbsp;&nbsp; published, objective, real, exists type stuff.&nbsp; And does it go into detail about uh how the the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh um electronic delivery mechanism is it by&nbsp; satellite or by some kind of radio that they would&nbsp;&nbsp; receive and send signals? Yeah, some um I don't&nbsp; know a whole lot about the technical side of it,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it was uh this is back in the 60s and 70s, so&nbsp; they wouldn't have been doing satellite uplinks&nbsp;&nbsp; on that at that point yet. Uh it would be some&nbsp; sort of line of sight radio beam of some kind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing that uh also is documented in um&nbsp; there's a journal called Defense Electronics in&nbsp;&nbsp; the July 1993 issue. Uh there's a one-page article&nbsp; there that describes technology that's under&nbsp;&nbsp; development. There's a Russian guy who specializes&nbsp; in this stuff. His name is Igor Smirnov. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp; basically technology for beaming different forms&nbsp; of radiation at people's heads. can either and&nbsp;&nbsp; there's about four or five MK Ultra projects that&nbsp; were on this kind of stuff. So, it can be either a&nbsp;&nbsp; sound energy uh percussion sound percussion waves&nbsp; uh or different types of light and radio frequency&nbsp;&nbsp; and all kinds of different types of energy. So,&nbsp; the Igor Smirnov is a specialist in this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff who has technology that he's developed. He&nbsp; was brought has technology that he's developed. He&nbsp;&nbsp; was brought over in um March of 1993 to a meeting&nbsp; in Northern Virginia that was attended by the CIA,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Defense Intelligence Agency. I think I&nbsp; remember the list, right? One of these might be&nbsp;&nbsp; wrong, but definitely the CIA, definitely the FBI,&nbsp; I think the Defense Intelligence Agency, I think&nbsp;&nbsp; the National Security Agency, a representative&nbsp; from General Electronics, and a representative&nbsp;&nbsp; from one of the universities who all got&nbsp; together to discuss the possibility of using this&nbsp;&nbsp; technology on David Kuresh and this was during&nbsp; the branch devidian siege. And according to the&nbsp;&nbsp; article, the reason they decided not to use this&nbsp; technology on him was uh problems with software&nbsp;&nbsp; compatibility between the Russian software and&nbsp; the American hardware. And what happened as an&nbsp;&nbsp; upshot at the meeting was that a term called a&nbsp; firm called Psycho Technologies that's based in&nbsp;&nbsp; uh in Virginia, I forget which town in Virginia,&nbsp; actually contracted with the Russians to develop&nbsp;&nbsp; this kind of technology for possible American&nbsp; usage. So that's all stuff that's actually real&nbsp;&nbsp; that's actually going on that's undergoing some&nbsp; sort of research and development. Currently in the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh MK Ultra projects, they also describe&nbsp; implanting brain electrodes in various kinds&nbsp;&nbsp; of animals including dolphins and using them&nbsp; as delivery systems for biological and chemical&nbsp;&nbsp; weapons. So that's actually in the CIA materials&nbsp; and they describe further research to fine-tune&nbsp;&nbsp; those kind of systems that were already&nbsp; in successful operational use. Do you have&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence of DIA involvement in the mind control&nbsp; experiments? Have you been able to get any DIA&nbsp;&nbsp; documentation? The for listeners that don't know,&nbsp; the DIA is the Defense Intelligence Agency. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that's the DIA is something like uh&nbsp; 10 times the size of the CIA as well. Actually,&nbsp;&nbsp; the CIA, the the director of the CIA controls&nbsp; only about 10% of the financial assets of the&nbsp;&nbsp; American intelligence community, meaning that the&nbsp; CIA is really a tiny fragment of all of military&nbsp;&nbsp; and civilian intelligence in the United States.&nbsp; The National Security Agency and the Defense&nbsp;&nbsp; Intelligence Agency are both quite a bit bigger.&nbsp; Um, the answer to your question is yes and no. The&nbsp;&nbsp; no part is I don't have uh direct documentation of&nbsp; defense intelligence agency mind control contracts&nbsp;&nbsp; but it's really kind of beside the point&nbsp; because all of these intelligence agencies&nbsp;&nbsp; are all interconnected with each other right for&nbsp; instance the CIA had two programs MK Ultra and MK&nbsp;&nbsp; Naomi and they uh got federal funds which they&nbsp; then put into MK Naomi and NK Naomi then funded&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the special operations division at Fort&nbsp; Detectric and Edgeware Arsenal to do mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; research. So, and that's the way it is with the&nbsp; radiation experiments too. The atomic energy&nbsp;&nbsp; commission, health, education, welfare, the CIA,&nbsp; all kinds of different government agencies are all&nbsp;&nbsp; interlin and interconnected. One of the um Defense&nbsp; Intelligence Agency programs was called Stargate.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a liaison between the CIA and the&nbsp; Defense Intelligence Agency on that. It was just&nbsp;&nbsp; declassified about roughly within the last year.&nbsp; Um, and there was a a program on in December on uh&nbsp;&nbsp; ABC TV, ABC's Night Line program in December where&nbsp; Bill Gates, who was a former head of the CIA,&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the guys who was the CIA person who was in&nbsp; responsible for less on between the CIA and the&nbsp;&nbsp; military on Stargate and one of the guys who was&nbsp; a Stargate contractor all talking about Stargate.&nbsp;&nbsp; uh which they admitted ran up until at least&nbsp; 1984 and had funding of at least $20 million,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is probably just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; And Stargate was a remote viewing program. So the&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence agencies all in an interconnected&nbsp; fashion uh spent millions of dollars on remote&nbsp;&nbsp; viewing, which is basically having psychics lie&nbsp; down on a table and try and see what's going on&nbsp;&nbsp; at some location in a foreign country to gather&nbsp; intelligence information. There's a book that was&nbsp;&nbsp; just published by um uh something Joseph Michael&nbsp; Joseph I think it is which is a branch of Penguin&nbsp;&nbsp; and British branch of Penguin books called Psychic&nbsp; Warrior where a guy describes being one of these&nbsp;&nbsp; remote viewers. A lot of that work was done at&nbsp; the Stanford Research Institute in uh PaloAlto,&nbsp;&nbsp; California. So I mentioned that partly because&nbsp; it's interesting partly because if you think&nbsp;&nbsp; that creating multiple personality disorder&nbsp; is too bizarre and strange to be real. Again,&nbsp;&nbsp; you have to look at this LSD, this brain electrode&nbsp; research, some of the sensory deprivation that&nbsp;&nbsp; Ames leaf room with those anisonic lenses using uh&nbsp; millions and millions and millions of dollars to&nbsp;&nbsp; pay psychics to spy on other countries while lying&nbsp; on tables in the United States. Once you have that&nbsp;&nbsp; context, then creating multiple personality just&nbsp; seems kind of small. Now what what is like uh I&nbsp;&nbsp; understand that the what's driving this was the&nbsp; cold war uh you know back from the information&nbsp;&nbsp; that we've got back late that's true and not&nbsp; true right but let me explain why it's true&nbsp;&nbsp; and not true okay just briefly that's actually&nbsp; a disinformation setup the term brainwashing was&nbsp;&nbsp; invented by uh a man named Edward Hunter who wrote&nbsp; a book about brainwashing in the early 1950s that&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a copy of. So he invented that term and&nbsp; described how the um American pilots and prisoners&nbsp;&nbsp; of war in the Korean War who were captured by&nbsp; the Chinese and then were made to sign false germ&nbsp;&nbsp; warfare confessions and were converted to being&nbsp; communists had been brainwashed. And then the&nbsp;&nbsp; whole idea was that the CIA and other intelligence&nbsp; agencies had to figure out how that happened. and&nbsp;&nbsp; Jolly West, Margaret Singer, and Robert Lifton&nbsp; who testified at the Patty Hurst trial. They all&nbsp;&nbsp; interviewed these returning prisoners of war&nbsp; in the Korean War and became experts on mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control and cult thought reform techniques and so&nbsp; on. So, the idea was that because the communists&nbsp;&nbsp; were doing that, we had to figure out how to&nbsp; combat that. So, it was mainly defensive and&nbsp;&nbsp; it was reactive to what the communist Chinese&nbsp; were doing. But that's not true. uh because&nbsp;&nbsp; GHBs was already doing that stuff in the second&nbsp; world war or you know way before the Korean war.&nbsp;&nbsp; So actually there was an offensive program of mind&nbsp; control by the OSS and other intelligence agencies&nbsp;&nbsp; uh 10 years before the Korean War. So the whole&nbsp; idea that it was got started because of the cold&nbsp;&nbsp; war is disinformation but then it obviously got&nbsp; fueled and entrenched by the cold war. And then&nbsp;&nbsp; the question becomes well the cold war is over.&nbsp; Why do we need that stuff anymore? Right? And&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the answer is severalfold. One is we in&nbsp; fact do need to have intelligence agencies. The&nbsp;&nbsp; world is not a safe place. And for us not to be&nbsp; living in Siberia and getting sent to labor camps&nbsp;&nbsp; in Siberia, we've got to protect ourselves from&nbsp; all kinds of forces in the world. And to do that,&nbsp;&nbsp; we have to have intelligence agencies. So I I&nbsp; have no beef with the CIA as such or the existence&nbsp;&nbsp; of intelligence agencies. I think they're&nbsp; essential to maintaining freedom and democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp; But once you've got intelligence agencies, you&nbsp; got the military and you got a bunch of budgets,&nbsp;&nbsp; you got people who like any federal bureaucrats&nbsp; have to justify their exper their budgets and&nbsp;&nbsp; their programs and everything. You got people&nbsp; who are already into this and you've got actual&nbsp;&nbsp; applications of it. And so it it'll just carry on,&nbsp; I think, indefinitely. And the fact that the Cold&nbsp;&nbsp; War is over, I don't see as being a major item&nbsp; in this stuff stopping. Now you mentioned in your&nbsp;&nbsp; previous lecture that you as you said you don't&nbsp; blame the CIA per se but uh the psychiatrists&nbsp;&nbsp; and doctors that are involved in this. Do you not&nbsp; feel that the CIA is uh hold some responsibility&nbsp;&nbsp; in funding and allowing the uh the doctors and&nbsp; psychiatrists to operate? Oh absolutely. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like these people definitely were I mean the&nbsp; victims of all of this definitely did not give&nbsp;&nbsp; informed consent. Uh definitely it was unethical.&nbsp; It was harmful. there was damages, they deserve&nbsp;&nbsp; compensation and the federal government's on&nbsp; the hook for that. And so the idea is not that&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sort of soft on the CIA or apologetic for&nbsp; them. It's just that I'm basically psychiatrist,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? So my number one concern is with all&nbsp; this bizarre, unethical, destructive conduct by&nbsp;&nbsp; my colleagues and the medical ethics of it and&nbsp; getting the medical profession under control.&nbsp;&nbsp; So what I think needs to happen is that it&nbsp; should no longer be allowed that psychiatrist,&nbsp;&nbsp; psychologists, doctors have funding from the&nbsp; CIA or the military without the subjects of the&nbsp;&nbsp; research knowing where the money is coming from&nbsp; and knowing that it's not really medical research&nbsp;&nbsp; as such. It's military intelligence warfare,&nbsp; psychological warfare, mind control research.&nbsp;&nbsp; um in some of the literature uh seems to suggest&nbsp; that Canada was offered up to supply so-called&nbsp;&nbsp; guinea pigs for the US mind control experiments.&nbsp; Um I'm particularly referring to um the Al&nbsp;&nbsp; Memorial at McGill University in Montreal with Dr.&nbsp; Cameron. What do you think has Canada's role been&nbsp;&nbsp; in in the US military mind control experiments?&nbsp; Well, the uh Canadian Psychiatric Association&nbsp;&nbsp; um put out some disinformation that's been&nbsp; pretty well bought by the Canadian public&nbsp;&nbsp; and that is that you and Cameron, it was just an&nbsp; isolated incident. Happened a long time ago back&nbsp;&nbsp; in the ' 50s that he had CIA funding. There were&nbsp; sort of different ethical standards back then.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, we wouldn't approve it now, but it was&nbsp; just a one-time deal and he was such a great man,&nbsp;&nbsp; we can overlook it. Well, that's not true because&nbsp; that research completely violated the ethical&nbsp;&nbsp; standards of the time. But also, it wasn't an&nbsp; isolated incident. In fact, you Cameron wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp; even the only person at McGill at that time with&nbsp; CIA funding. Dr. Raymond Prince was funded through&nbsp;&nbsp; MK Ultra sub project 121 to do um anthropological&nbsp; psychiatry research in Nigeria. He didn't know at&nbsp;&nbsp; the time it was CIA money. Donald Heb who is the&nbsp; chairman of the department of psychology there did&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of sensory deprivation experiments funded&nbsp; by Canada's defense research board when the CIA&nbsp;&nbsp; stopped funding you and Cameron's work health&nbsp; education and welfare Canada just picked it up&nbsp;&nbsp; and continued this incredibly unethical harmful&nbsp; destructive research that wiped out people's&nbsp;&nbsp; memories for their whole lives um there's a man&nbsp; named Hassan Azima who is a psychiatrist who died&nbsp;&nbsp; of cancer in his early 40s who was being groomed&nbsp; assumed to be a mind control researcher who was&nbsp;&nbsp; doing LSD and sensory deprivation experiments at&nbsp; McGill and who was presenting u at conferences&nbsp;&nbsp; where all these other military and CIA funded&nbsp; people were at. So he was in the loop. Um James&nbsp;&nbsp; Tyhurst who in 1951 was part of a committee&nbsp; meeting to oversee Bluebird and Artichoke in&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada before you and Cameron got his money. uh&nbsp; was also uh funded by Canada's defense research&nbsp;&nbsp; board. He did LSD research also at MC Hollywood&nbsp; Hospital in Vancouver and uh doctor named Ross&nbsp;&nbsp; Mlan who was a director at Hollywood Hospital in&nbsp; Vancouver attended a CIA sponsored LSD symposium&nbsp;&nbsp; and described giving LSD to 338 different patients&nbsp; at Hollywood Hospital. So there's a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; military LSD flowing into Vancouver. Then Abram&nbsp; Hoffer and Humphrey Osman did a lot of military&nbsp;&nbsp; LSD research in Saskatchewan. And Humphrey&nbsp; Osman then left and moved down to the New Jersey&nbsp;&nbsp; neurosychiatric institute in Pennsylvania where&nbsp; Carl Feifer was which is where the Louis Castillo&nbsp;&nbsp; guy was who was over in the Philippines and got&nbsp; arrested by the FBI over there. So there's been&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of connections with Canadian psychiatry. A&nbsp; spin-off of all of that. Some of the research is&nbsp;&nbsp; funded by the military or the CIA or whoever&nbsp; and then that gets published and presented&nbsp;&nbsp; at conferences and talked about and then other&nbsp; civilian psychiatrists who aren't directly funded&nbsp;&nbsp; by the CIA start doing the same kind of stuff. Hm.&nbsp; An example of that was at uh Penitentanglishing&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospital which is the up on Lake Hiron there where&nbsp; there's a basically a heavy duty facility for&nbsp;&nbsp; people who are criminally insane, not guilty by&nbsp; reason of insanity, unfit to stand trial. In the&nbsp;&nbsp; years about 1968-69, there's four papers published&nbsp; in the Canadian Psychiatric Association Journal,&nbsp;&nbsp; which you can go to any of the medical school&nbsp; libraries in Canada and just pull it off the&nbsp;&nbsp; shelf and read it. This psychiatrist named Elliot&nbsp; Barker, who's still alive, was working there. He&nbsp;&nbsp; invented a little room called the capsule that was&nbsp; about 8 by 10 ft. He would put prisoners as young&nbsp;&nbsp; as 15 going up into early 30s in this capsule in&nbsp; groups of either two up to uh seven at a time for&nbsp;&nbsp; periods of days up to as 11 days at a time all&nbsp; naked and often on LSD. So there's all these&nbsp;&nbsp; violent offenders, murderers, arsonists, rapists&nbsp; and so on. And he would have them in this little&nbsp;&nbsp; small capsule all naked on LSD kind of doing&nbsp; rap sessions and therapy groups with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the um room would be monitored by other&nbsp; prisoners through the uh either video link&nbsp;&nbsp; or camera link or through a mirror in the ceiling&nbsp; and other prisoners were responsible for supplying&nbsp;&nbsp; them food and so on. There was a one toilet inside&nbsp; the capsule and they would be signaled to change&nbsp;&nbsp; from one kind of therapy group to another by&nbsp; changing the kind color of the light that was&nbsp;&nbsp; shown into the room. So they were in this kind of&nbsp; group sensory deprivation with changing colored&nbsp;&nbsp; lights and um the idea was that this would get&nbsp; through their defenses and then get to the real&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff and do real therapy. One of the co-authors&nbsp; on one of these patients is an HM Mason who's at&nbsp;&nbsp; the bottom of the paper it says that he was a&nbsp; patient at this Oakidge facility in Penitentang&nbsp;&nbsp; on a ward called F-Ward that a documentary was&nbsp; made about it by the CBC. actually have a copy&nbsp;&nbsp; of a video of it. So, this HM is both one of these&nbsp; patients who are all murderers and arsonists and&nbsp;&nbsp; rapists and so on who's in this capsule getting&nbsp; LSD and he's also a co-author on the paper. And&nbsp;&nbsp; then apparently uh several of the former inmates&nbsp; lived with Elliot Barker post discharge. And this&nbsp;&nbsp; uh HM Mason, as far as I can tell, is the&nbsp; same guy as Hank Mason. Hank Mason is on&nbsp;&nbsp; the web page of the Canadian Society for the&nbsp; Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which is&nbsp;&nbsp; um just what it says. It's Canadian Society for&nbsp; Prevention of Cruelty to the Children. The current&nbsp;&nbsp; president is Elliot Barker. And this Hank Mason&nbsp; has got a who is identified as a founding member&nbsp;&nbsp; of the society has a little statement about child&nbsp; abuse on the web page. So it would appear that the&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian Society for the Prevention of Cruelty&nbsp; of the Children has had executive members who&nbsp;&nbsp; are former uh violent criminals in a facility&nbsp; for the criminally insane currently being run by&nbsp;&nbsp; psychiatrists who did all this kind of research&nbsp; who published it in the Canadian Psychiatric&nbsp;&nbsp; Association journal. Interesting. Just the kind of&nbsp; stuff that it goes on and on and on and on and on&nbsp;&nbsp; with more stories like this. What's your sense&nbsp; of how many Canadian centers and doctors that&nbsp;&nbsp; were involved in the experimentations? Uh well,&nbsp; absolute minimum of 5 to 10. Mhm. Centers or&nbsp;&nbsp; uh doctors and centers? Yeah. Okay. I mean for&nbsp; sure there was McGill um Wurn Saskatchewan and&nbsp;&nbsp; University of Saskatchewan, Hollywood Hospital,&nbsp; um another hospital in Montreal where LS Divas.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I forget if it was Montreal General.&nbsp; I think it was Montreal general, but I'm not&nbsp;&nbsp; sure about that. I have it documented somewhere.&nbsp; Then the same kind of stuff apparently not funded&nbsp;&nbsp; by the military or intelligence was community was&nbsp; going on at Penitentang. Is there any indication&nbsp;&nbsp; that uh experiments were being done on military&nbsp; bases themselves? Uh not documented evidence, but&nbsp;&nbsp; there's quite a few accounts from patients that&nbsp; are unverified. Yeah. Right. Um you mentioned that&nbsp;&nbsp; like some of the uh doctors that were involved in&nbsp; this research were unwitting. What uh what kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of funding uh um institutes were set up to fund&nbsp; this kind of research to unwitting doctors? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; they use what they called cutouts. A cutout is&nbsp; a front funding organization. The three major&nbsp;&nbsp; ones were the human ecology foundation, the Josiah&nbsp; Macy Jr. Foundation and the Kashikar Medical Fund.&nbsp;&nbsp; So each of these would be funded from the CIA and&nbsp; then in turn they would fund right and the people&nbsp;&nbsp; who were running those organizations knew that it&nbsp; was CIA money and often themselves got grants from&nbsp;&nbsp; the CIA. One of the guys who was on the board of&nbsp; the human ecology foundation who reviewed grants&nbsp;&nbsp; for the human ecology foundation and himself got&nbsp; an MK Ultra grant and had top secret clearance&nbsp;&nbsp; was Carl Rogers. That's kind of amazing because&nbsp; Carl Rogers is best known for client- centered&nbsp;&nbsp; therapy which is a kind of humanistic valuing&nbsp; the spiritual worth of the client kind of therapy&nbsp;&nbsp; where you have to have uh accurate empathy&nbsp; unconditional positive regard for the person&nbsp;&nbsp; and genuine uh empathy. So it's a it's like the&nbsp; stereotype most humanistic touchyfey psychotherapy&nbsp;&nbsp; going and he was actually uh top secret cleared&nbsp; and funding secret CI mind control research. Now, there's a lot of uh doctors and uh some&nbsp; therapists out there that um dismiss the idea&nbsp;&nbsp; of of multiple personalities. And um um one&nbsp; of the things that some of these people are&nbsp;&nbsp; saying is that it's doesn't exist and that&nbsp; it's actually temporal lobe epilepsy. What&nbsp;&nbsp; is temporal lobe epilepsy and and how is it&nbsp; similar to MPD? Well, temporal lobe epilepsy&nbsp;&nbsp; is just a form of epilepsy that takes place&nbsp; in the temporal lobe of your brain. So there's&nbsp;&nbsp; abnormal electrical discharges that cause you to&nbsp; have a seizure. A typical temporal lobe seizure&nbsp;&nbsp; invol lasts for 30 to 90 seconds. You may become&nbsp; unconscious or just get a kind of foggy state of&nbsp;&nbsp; consciousness and you'll usually like fumble&nbsp; at one of your buttons or smack your lips or&nbsp;&nbsp; turn your body in a very kind of mechanistic over&nbsp; and over same little motion kind of way and then&nbsp;&nbsp; you pop out of it after 30 seconds usually. So&nbsp; temporal load epilepsy is completely unrelated&nbsp;&nbsp; to multiple personality disorder. That's just a&nbsp; bogus prejudice. And there's a bunch of research&nbsp;&nbsp; that I and others have done that show that the&nbsp; symptom picture of temporal epilepsy and multiple&nbsp;&nbsp; personality are completely different from each&nbsp; other. Why why would these people be making these&nbsp;&nbsp; claims? What what would be, you know, why the&nbsp; confusion? Uh because they're they don't take&nbsp;&nbsp; accurate histories. They're very vague about what&nbsp; they say and they just look grasping at straws&nbsp;&nbsp; for some way to discredit multiple personality.&nbsp; Basically, the the more serious criticism is that&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple personality is often unwittingly created&nbsp; by bad therapists. No, that I agree with and I've&nbsp;&nbsp; actually testified about that in court that&nbsp; in cases where I'm testifying for the patient&nbsp;&nbsp; who's suing the therapist and I'm stating as&nbsp; an expert witness that yes, this was created&nbsp;&nbsp; by the therapist and yes, all these memories were&nbsp; false and yes, it did all this harm. Now, this is&nbsp;&nbsp; a very complex issue and one that's being hotly&nbsp; debated by the public. Um, the the main thing is&nbsp;&nbsp; that there actually is a whole bunch of science&nbsp; about multiple personality and dissociation. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; not just a matter of belief. There's a a big&nbsp; literature now that has flaws in it and so on,&nbsp;&nbsp; but there's actually a whole bunch of science.&nbsp; It's not just I believe or I don't believe. The&nbsp;&nbsp; the curious twist in the logic is that actually&nbsp; I think that all of this uh documentation that&nbsp;&nbsp; the military and the CIA have been creating&nbsp; experimental multiple personality and using&nbsp;&nbsp; it in operations actually proves that multiple&nbsp; personality is real. It proves two things. One&nbsp;&nbsp; is that unless they're just wasting money, they're&nbsp; not going to bother with the whole exercise unless&nbsp;&nbsp; you actually can create a new identity that&nbsp; actually is hidden behind a real memory barrier.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, there'll be no point, right? And that&nbsp; could be that could be used operationally, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; So then the none of it's actually really really&nbsp; really real. It's all illusions inside your mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; There isn't literally another person in there,&nbsp; but nobody in the multiple personality field is&nbsp;&nbsp; saying that it's literally real anyway to start&nbsp; with. But you can create this artificial second&nbsp;&nbsp; identity and it can actually do stuff that the&nbsp; main part of the person doesn't remember. That has&nbsp;&nbsp; to be true otherwise there would be no point in&nbsp; creating it for military use. And so that proves&nbsp;&nbsp; two things. One is that it's possible to create&nbsp; multiple personality by a mistake in a bad therapy&nbsp;&nbsp; that mimics a lot of the conditions of military&nbsp; mind control or cult mind control. But also if you&nbsp;&nbsp; have a disorder that can be created deliberately&nbsp; either be by the CIA, by a destructive cult, by a&nbsp;&nbsp; therapist who doesn't really know what they're&nbsp; doing or even by the person themselves, then&nbsp;&nbsp; it's not really a big jump to imagine that that it&nbsp; could also happen just naturally and spontaneously&nbsp;&nbsp; as a way of coping with trauma. Right. So the very&nbsp; fact that you can create it artificially to me&nbsp;&nbsp; indicates that it can be created artificially by&nbsp; mistake or on purpose and also that it's likely to&nbsp;&nbsp; happen naturally. Well, the other question is&nbsp; h how they managed to create it artificially.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and is it a traumatic I'm writing about all&nbsp; this now. I have a number of case histories that&nbsp;&nbsp; describe it in quite a lot of detail. There's a&nbsp; the there's a lot of information about how they&nbsp;&nbsp; created Tanya and Patty Hurst. It's very detailed.&nbsp; There's a very good case from Denmark. A guy named&nbsp;&nbsp; Pali Hardrop who was uh in jail in the let's&nbsp; see now late 40s in Denmark. Another prisoner&nbsp;&nbsp; named Bujornne Nielsen used a whole lot of mind&nbsp; control and hypnosis techniques and created this&nbsp;&nbsp; uh and music bank robber and pi hardrip actually&nbsp; went out and robbed a bank and then he robbed&nbsp;&nbsp; another bank tried to rob a second bank shot&nbsp; two people didn't get away with any money got&nbsp;&nbsp; captured and the net outcome of the huge trial&nbsp; with 50 witnesses and all kinds of psychiatric&nbsp;&nbsp; testimony and so on. The net outcome of it was&nbsp; that this Bejorn Nielsen guy was found guilty and&nbsp;&nbsp; sentenced to jail even though he wasn't physically&nbsp; present at any of the robberies and Pali Hardrop&nbsp;&nbsp; was found kind of an equivalent of not guilty by&nbsp; reason of insanity and they ex specifically said&nbsp;&nbsp; at the trial all the experts did that this Bejorn&nbsp; Neielson guy used hypnosis and other methods to&nbsp;&nbsp; create a split identity hardrip. So these kind of&nbsp; cases have actually come to trial and there's a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of detail on them. What what would these other&nbsp; methods be and what would the links be between&nbsp;&nbsp; the methods used for create artificially creating&nbsp; multiple personalities and childhood trauma? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; the links are severalfold. One is you have to&nbsp; have a pretty good control over the person's life&nbsp;&nbsp; space. You can't just see them for half an hour,&nbsp; an hour a week and that's all that's required.&nbsp;&nbsp; So in the palihardy case, these two guys were&nbsp; salemates, cellmates and also they worked in&nbsp;&nbsp; the same workshop and were basically with each&nbsp; other constantly for about 18 months. Uh if you&nbsp;&nbsp; can isolate the person from the outside world&nbsp; from contact with other people who are going&nbsp;&nbsp; to be critical of what's going on or give a&nbsp; different point of view that's helpful. These&nbsp;&nbsp; are these things apply to destructive cults and&nbsp; also deliberate creation of multiple personality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then if you can uh use all kinds of thought reform&nbsp; techniques that is getting the person to study&nbsp;&nbsp; doctrine do all kinds of meditation exercises,&nbsp; chanting exercises, hypnotic focusing exercises,&nbsp;&nbsp; internal dream imagery exercises, you get their&nbsp; mind kind of into a trance state and focused on&nbsp;&nbsp; what you want them to believe and focus on. Then&nbsp; you actually use formal hypnosis some or drugs and&nbsp;&nbsp; then you deliberately instruct them that you&nbsp; want to create a second identity and then you&nbsp;&nbsp; figure out what is it that this person's going&nbsp; to be motivated by. So in the pali hardrip case&nbsp;&nbsp; uh this bejorn neielson guy created uh guardian&nbsp; spirit x and whenever bejorn neielson was speaking&nbsp;&nbsp; to pi hardrop it was actually ex who was talking&nbsp; through bejorn neielsen and he got pi hardup to&nbsp;&nbsp; buy into that cuz he was interested in all&nbsp; kinds of new age type stuff and then uh ex&nbsp;&nbsp; started teaching him the path to enlightenment&nbsp; and so the basic motivator was that he was going&nbsp;&nbsp; to get to enlightenment and if he didn't follow&nbsp; follow the doctrine, didn't follow the rules,&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't follow all the tests, and didn't perform&nbsp; adequately, then he would lose X and he would lose&nbsp;&nbsp; his path to enlightenment. And that was the thing&nbsp; that he was most obsessed with. So that was the&nbsp;&nbsp; carrot that kept him going. So you have to find&nbsp; some sort of carrot that'll keep the person going.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then uh you can use uh any number of&nbsp; different kinds of behavior modification&nbsp;&nbsp; techniques which could be uh punishing the person&nbsp; if they say what you don't want them to say,&nbsp;&nbsp; rewarding them if they say what you do want&nbsp; them to say. And it I mean I could go on with&nbsp;&nbsp; the list a little bit but basically you have to&nbsp; get control over the person's thoughts over their&nbsp;&nbsp; life space and you have to set up a reward and&nbsp; punishment system to steer them along the path&nbsp;&nbsp; you want so that they become kind of robots who&nbsp; just repeat the doctrine that you want and then&nbsp;&nbsp; if you want to create the second identity you&nbsp; can use uh all kinds of threats or you can use&nbsp;&nbsp; actual trauma and fear and the trauma and the fear&nbsp; and the agitation the upset drive the splitting&nbsp;&nbsp; of the mind. just naturally cuz the human mind&nbsp; tends to split or dissociate in some way to cope&nbsp;&nbsp; with trauma all the time, right? Whether it be a&nbsp; plane crash or natural disaster or sexual assault&nbsp;&nbsp; in adulthood. And then the other ingredient with&nbsp; children is that their minds just seem to be more&nbsp;&nbsp; susceptible to this kind of splitting process.&nbsp; The their child's mind tends to do that naturally. You're listening to 88.1. We'll be right back&nbsp;&nbsp; with the second half of this interview&nbsp; with Dr. Colin Ross right after this. Are you familiar with Jennifer Fried's work with&nbsp; her theory of betrayal trauma when it deals with&nbsp;&nbsp; child abuse? Actually, the I wasn't going into&nbsp; all of this here, but the main change in my&nbsp;&nbsp; thinking in terms of how I work with these people&nbsp; clinically over the last 3 years has been shifting&nbsp;&nbsp; much more towards a betrayal trauma type way of&nbsp; looking at things. Mhm. That's not really directly&nbsp;&nbsp; related to mind control, but yeah, I like her&nbsp; theory a lot and I agree with it. Right. Um, the&nbsp;&nbsp; false memory people, Jennifer Fried, for listeners&nbsp; who don't know, is the daughter of Pamela and&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter Fried. Pamela Fried's the executive director&nbsp; of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation. And the&nbsp;&nbsp; False Memory Syndrome Foundation takes a point&nbsp; of view that multiple personality is pretty bogus&nbsp;&nbsp; and all these memories that people in therapy are&nbsp; recovering are all false. And it's just a result&nbsp;&nbsp; of basically of mind control techniques by bad&nbsp; therapists. Um the the scientific advisory board&nbsp;&nbsp; of the false memory syndrome foundation which is&nbsp; a whole bunch of academics and experts who advise&nbsp;&nbsp; the foundation and sort of speak on behalf&nbsp; of it include Martin or Jolly West who had&nbsp;&nbsp; top secret CIA clearance. uh Harold Leaf who is&nbsp; the personal psychiatrist to the Friedes also uh&nbsp;&nbsp; was a co-author of Robert Heath who did the brain&nbsp; electrode research at Tain that was funded by the&nbsp;&nbsp; various branches of the military and the CIA and&nbsp; there's um about five of Martin Orin's co-authors&nbsp;&nbsp; or people that he thanks in publications of&nbsp; his uh going back into the 50s different mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control research that he did who are also on&nbsp; the board. Margaret Singer who interviewed&nbsp;&nbsp; these Korean prisoners of war who had top secret&nbsp; clearance through the military to do that work&nbsp;&nbsp; is also on the board. Um so there's a quite&nbsp; an connection and overlap between these false&nbsp;&nbsp; memory syndrome foundation people not all of them&nbsp; but a subgroup of them and all this military mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control research. Have you had any experiences&nbsp; with the false memory syndrome foundation? And I&nbsp;&nbsp; understand they have been fairly aggressive in uh&nbsp; in intimidating uh therapists uh throughout North&nbsp;&nbsp; America. Well, North America. Well, I've had&nbsp; a fair bit of experience with the False Memory&nbsp;&nbsp; Syndrome Foundation. I sub I belong to the False&nbsp; Memory Syndrome Foundation. I get their newsletter&nbsp;&nbsp; and I've um been talked about and have written&nbsp; in their newsletter. I set up a workshop in uh&nbsp;&nbsp; Houston where I spoke for a day and a half and&nbsp; Pamela Fried the executive director spoke for half&nbsp;&nbsp; a day and I've set up about five or six workshops&nbsp; that I've done with Elizabeth Loftess who's a one&nbsp;&nbsp; of the leading members of the advisory board. Um I&nbsp; get spoke at a meeting that Steven Cece was at. He&nbsp;&nbsp; spoke after me and he commented very favorably on&nbsp; my talk. He's on the advisory board. So, I've got&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of uh contacts with uh some of these people&nbsp; which I consider to be very friendly. I admire&nbsp;&nbsp; their work. Uh I disagree a little bit with some&nbsp; of the things I think. But by and large, I agree&nbsp;&nbsp; with probably over half of what the majority of&nbsp; people on the false memory syndrome advisory board&nbsp;&nbsp; say. And as I mentioned earlier, I've testified&nbsp; in court basically much the same as any of those&nbsp;&nbsp; people would. that here's an example of really bad&nbsp; therapy that created multiple personality out of&nbsp;&nbsp; nowhere and caused a lot of damage and harm to&nbsp; the person and their family. In the false memory&nbsp;&nbsp; syndrome sort of camp, not necessarily the&nbsp; organization itself, but in the kind of camp,&nbsp;&nbsp; there are people who are just real extremists have&nbsp; gone way overboard and they're very inflammatory&nbsp;&nbsp; in the way they talk and everything's all black&nbsp; and white and the whole multiple personality&nbsp;&nbsp; field is supposed to be totally bad and all the&nbsp; memories are completely false. And so there's&nbsp;&nbsp; people in that camp who go way overboard. My&nbsp; view on them is that if you take sort of set&nbsp;&nbsp; aside some of the really political posturing and&nbsp; the most kind of rabid politics that comes out and&nbsp;&nbsp; you just listen to kind of the basic message,&nbsp; I agree with it. I think it's been incredibly&nbsp;&nbsp; helpful to the field. Not just uh dissocive&nbsp; disorders field or sexual trauma therapists,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the entire mental health field really. In&nbsp; the 1980s, there was almost zero teaching on how&nbsp;&nbsp; errorprone memory is, almost no teaching at all&nbsp; about how to think about it, what to do about it,&nbsp;&nbsp; what guidelines we need. All these guidelines&nbsp; about false memories and memory not being reliable&nbsp;&nbsp; really have only come out of the professional&nbsp; organization starting in '94. And the False Memory&nbsp;&nbsp; Syndrome Foundation spearheaded that. So, a lot of&nbsp; the work they've done has been incredibly helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with it. And it's simply a fact that&nbsp; memory is very unreliable, right? It's just when&nbsp;&nbsp; you things get really polarized and everybody's&nbsp; really insulting everybody else and it's a big&nbsp;&nbsp; war, then it becomes ridiculous. Well, and and it&nbsp; seems that the survivors uh of abuse are are again&nbsp;&nbsp; revictimized by by this type of argument where um&nbsp; you know, the focus seems to be proving whether a&nbsp;&nbsp; memory was false or not instead of um actually um&nbsp; finding out whether abuse did happen or not. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; it gets all politicized and everybody gets very&nbsp; hot under the collar and very defensive about&nbsp;&nbsp; it. like in the in the false memory syndrome&nbsp; foundation the in the membership I'm sure that&nbsp;&nbsp; there are a whole bunch of people who actually&nbsp; are falsely accused but I'm sure there's also a&nbsp;&nbsp; whole bunch of people who are accurately accused&nbsp; and are just trying to run a little scam and say&nbsp;&nbsp; it's false memories right but that that needs to&nbsp; be set aside if you're trying to look at sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; scientifically what are the issues about memory&nbsp; and what's the best way to do therapy and how&nbsp;&nbsp; do you have to kind of balance things to have&nbsp; therapy that's hopefully more beneficial than&nbsp;&nbsp; more harmful if people would get off all of the&nbsp; ugly politics and have more of a sort of rational&nbsp;&nbsp; calm scientific discussion. It' be much better.&nbsp; And then uh you know then they wouldn't hear the&nbsp;&nbsp; therapist saying that the false memory people&nbsp; are all just pedophiles and you wouldn't hear&nbsp;&nbsp; the false memory people saying that the therapists&nbsp; are all insane. Now in your opinion, how has the&nbsp;&nbsp; false memory debate affected therapy resources&nbsp; available for survivors in in a general sense?&nbsp;&nbsp; Um well it's affected negatively basically because&nbsp; the a lot of the therapists have got real paranoid&nbsp;&nbsp; and there's a lot of agitation in um insurance&nbsp; companies and the managed care companies in the&nbsp;&nbsp; United States about this kind of therapy. Now the&nbsp; idea that most of the memories are false really is&nbsp;&nbsp; just the basic standard position of psychiatry&nbsp; through the whole 20th century. It's nothing&nbsp;&nbsp; new. How how do you feel that the debate has&nbsp; affected how therapists deal with their clients?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I think it's been beneficial and harmful&nbsp; at the same time. It's been beneficial because&nbsp;&nbsp; therapists have had to get their act together&nbsp; a little bit and be more aware that memory is&nbsp;&nbsp; extremely vague and unreliable and that you&nbsp; can't take everything at face value. And then&nbsp;&nbsp; I've written at great length about strategically&nbsp; how to plan the therapy so that you do the same&nbsp;&nbsp; thing no matter what percentage of the memory is&nbsp; true or false. Most of the time you don't know for&nbsp;&nbsp; a fact. So, it's been very helpful in that way.&nbsp; And then it's been harmful in that uh it's just&nbsp;&nbsp; given an excuse to all kinds of people who don't&nbsp; want to deal with abuse anyway to say, \"Oh, it's&nbsp;&nbsp; all false memories.\" And it's made the therapist&nbsp; defensive and it's taken a lot of time and energy&nbsp;&nbsp; away from treatment on to worrying about whether&nbsp; you're going to get sued or not. But you can't&nbsp;&nbsp; they're sort of opposite sides of the same coin.&nbsp; You you can't have therapists finally getting&nbsp;&nbsp; the message that they have to be more careful&nbsp; without also having therapists who are more&nbsp;&nbsp; paranoid about getting sued. U for the benefit&nbsp; of other therapists that might be listening,&nbsp;&nbsp; is there um a way to recognize signs of possible&nbsp; mind control experimentation? Are there signs that&nbsp;&nbsp; come up again and again in survivor accounts? Uh&nbsp; you mean actual military or intelligence agency&nbsp;&nbsp; mind control, right? Or because mind control&nbsp; can be done informally and unwittingly by just&nbsp;&nbsp; the pedophile father at home or it can be done by&nbsp; any one of the known destructive cults or it can&nbsp;&nbsp; be done as part of a military research program.&nbsp; So it depends which level you're talking about.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm speaking yeah specifically of the government&nbsp; uh funded experiments. No, there's no kind of uh&nbsp;&nbsp; you know if the person comes in with a sore left&nbsp; elbow that's a sure sign. There's no kind of sign&nbsp;&nbsp; or symptom like that that's going to automatically&nbsp; clue you off, but there's probably going to be&nbsp;&nbsp; some sort of dissociative disorder. And it's it's&nbsp; not so much that you go after it as the person&nbsp;&nbsp; starts giving you memories of, you know, it wasn't&nbsp; some stereotype satanic thing out in the woods.&nbsp;&nbsp; They start actually telling you uh something&nbsp; that sounds like medical research of some kind,&nbsp;&nbsp; experiments of some kind. It's either at a&nbsp; university, it's in a hospital, it's on a&nbsp;&nbsp; military base. So, I don't think it really is a&nbsp; bad plan to specifically start asking questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to just wait and for the person to start&nbsp; describing that kind of stuff. And then if they&nbsp;&nbsp; start describing that kind of stuff, you just&nbsp; follow normal kind of therapy procedures where&nbsp;&nbsp; you just say, \"Could you tell me a little bit&nbsp; more about that?\" or I don't quite understand&nbsp;&nbsp; this or could you clarify that or what does that&nbsp; mean to you? Why is that important to you? How&nbsp;&nbsp; is that affecting you now? How does that tie into&nbsp; the problems that we're working on now? Mhm. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; you really just handle it using basic sensible&nbsp; therapy techniques that you wouldn't there's&nbsp;&nbsp; not a special set of strategies or techniques for&nbsp; mind control as such. And these people basically&nbsp;&nbsp; are human beings who have who've been hurt and&nbsp; have problems and you need to use same basic&nbsp;&nbsp; methods of therapy you would otherwise. So like&nbsp; if my personal conclusion is that probably the&nbsp;&nbsp; majority not almost for sure the vast majority of&nbsp; the satanic ritual abuse memories that I've heard&nbsp;&nbsp; which involves like hundreds and hundreds and&nbsp; hundreds and hundreds of babies being sacrificed&nbsp;&nbsp; vast majority of that can't actually be real. Some&nbsp; of it could be, but the techniques that I use and&nbsp;&nbsp; the strategies use in therapy for people who have&nbsp; those satanic ritual abuse memories are really&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty much identical to the same strategies for&nbsp; somebody who doesn't have those kind of memories.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the same applies to the military mind control&nbsp; people. The way I go at it, I use the same basic&nbsp;&nbsp; strategies, principles, and techniques. I don't&nbsp; really focus on the memories as the main problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mhm. In in your um opinion, do you think there is&nbsp; any links between um the accounts of ritual abuse&nbsp;&nbsp; and mind control experimentation? Uh nothing&nbsp; documented. The only the link is in the mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control experts. The people who are contractors&nbsp; for the CI and the military who understand the&nbsp;&nbsp; mind control techniques. Therefore, the military&nbsp; wants to tap into their expertise are also tend&nbsp;&nbsp; to people be people who are experts on mind&nbsp; control techniques of destructive cults. But&nbsp;&nbsp; a direct connection between cults and the&nbsp; military. The only uh book I know about&nbsp;&nbsp; that is a book called was Jonestown a CIA medical&nbsp; experiment written by a man named Michael Meyers,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Published by the Edwin Melon Press. and he&nbsp; pres presents a lot of pretty solid documentation&nbsp;&nbsp; that's not quite 100% conclusive that the CIA was&nbsp; heavily involved in Jonestown. Right. You've gone&nbsp;&nbsp; into a fair bit of detail in that in your your&nbsp; lecture that we've previously well one couple of&nbsp;&nbsp; just to give a little smattering of the kind of&nbsp; things. One example is that the people's temple&nbsp;&nbsp; which was run by Jim Stone Jim Jones was based in&nbsp; Yukaya, California which is north of San Francisco&nbsp;&nbsp; and then they moved down to the jungle in British&nbsp; Gana. And before I read this book, I never really&nbsp;&nbsp; thought about how did they go about choosing that&nbsp; site. M well it turns out that that site in the&nbsp;&nbsp; middle of the jungle in British Gana immediately&nbsp; before Jim Jones moved down there it was the site&nbsp;&nbsp; of the CIA shalom project which was a program for&nbsp; uh black exgring Bray u military people to train&nbsp;&nbsp; mercenaries for Angola and then there's a whole&nbsp; which obviously couldn't just be coincidence and&nbsp;&nbsp; then there's just a wealth of other detail&nbsp; like that connecting all kinds of things in Who in your sense who who do you think&nbsp; is behind all of this? Like the Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I'm sort of not really that much&nbsp; of a conspiracy theorist. I just think&nbsp;&nbsp; that it boils down to typical normal stuff&nbsp; that controls the rest of the world. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's got to do with military and the government&nbsp; and banks and helicopter sales and spying. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's it's no different from, you know, who runs&nbsp; radar or who runs jets or who runs anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a lot of it's just military contracting&nbsp; and it's government and it's a big business and&nbsp;&nbsp; Mhm. I don't I don't I'm not I don't personally&nbsp; subscribe to a special conspiracy theory like and&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think there's anyone at least the evidence&nbsp; I see I don't think there's any one little group&nbsp;&nbsp; of people who meet in some room you know somewhere&nbsp; at the Pentagon who are pulling all the strings on&nbsp;&nbsp; all this. I think it's much like the federal&nbsp; government. It's all kinds of little groups&nbsp;&nbsp; working at cross purposes and there's no one grand&nbsp; master design of any kind. Right. It's a network&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the old boys network. Uh yeah, old boys network&nbsp; is the way I describe it. And that's one reason&nbsp;&nbsp; I think of that is there doesn't have to be some&nbsp; kind of huge obviously there is a conspiracy in a&nbsp;&nbsp; sense and that it there's secret funding of mind&nbsp; control research and there's files and it's kept&nbsp;&nbsp; from the public. But in terms of the stuff that&nbsp; actually documented, there didn't have to be that&nbsp;&nbsp; huge a conspiracy because they just went ahead and&nbsp; published it in the medical literature anyway. The&nbsp;&nbsp; conspiracy is really the sort of old boys network.&nbsp; Everybody just looks the other way and knows that&nbsp;&nbsp; they're not supposed to comment on it kind of&nbsp; conspiracy. Mhm. It's not that anybody has to,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, send out a memo to every psychiatrist in&nbsp; North America saying keep this secret. Everybody&nbsp;&nbsp; just kind of looks the other way, steers around&nbsp; it, doesn't rock the boat, doesn't make waves.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've just got a couple more questions. Um I'm&nbsp; wondering uh how how a person undergoes the&nbsp;&nbsp; healing process that that have been um traumatized&nbsp; as a child or having participated um in the mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control experimentation. What what is the process&nbsp; for healing? Uh well some some people are probably&nbsp;&nbsp; too damaged to be able to heal. U so nobody&nbsp; should claim that they know how to help everybody.&nbsp;&nbsp; um or some people are damaged and they have the&nbsp; ability to heal, but I just not going to be able&nbsp;&nbsp; to describe how that should be done. So, they&nbsp; need to go to somebody else. But the people that&nbsp;&nbsp; we work with, m multiple personality, who I'll&nbsp; describe really traumatic childhoods. Um we don't&nbsp;&nbsp; really, like I mentioned just a few minutes ago,&nbsp; we don't really focus on the memories as such.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mhm. What we deal with is how these different&nbsp; personalities working together as a sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; inner family are getting along with each other and&nbsp; mostly not getting along with each other. And we&nbsp;&nbsp; try and get them to have more open communication&nbsp; and cooperation with each other, have more of a&nbsp;&nbsp; problem solving, strategizing kind of approach to&nbsp; life instead of all this conflict and fighting and&nbsp;&nbsp; amnesia. And then uh we work on building up more&nbsp; healthy, more flexible ways of coping with life.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's just in a nutshell to describe in&nbsp; detail is that's why my book is 400 pages long,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Takes quite a while. Um, and you you had&nbsp; mentioned that um a lot of in in in a particular&nbsp;&nbsp; test that you've done um a lot were able to&nbsp; integrate um these personalities back into a&nbsp;&nbsp; a kind of a hole. Is that is that really the goal&nbsp; of of the healing process or Well, it's the it's&nbsp;&nbsp; the goal in one sense to be this is we're just&nbsp; talking about people with multiple personality.&nbsp;&nbsp; vast majority of people who are involved in mind&nbsp; control experiments and the vast majority of&nbsp;&nbsp; people who are abused as children don't have&nbsp; multiple personality. I so I just specialize&nbsp;&nbsp; in that little subgroup which is only little you&nbsp; know small island in this whole sea of trauma but&nbsp;&nbsp; um the reason integration is the goal for them&nbsp; is basically that it's it's normal and desirable&nbsp;&nbsp; to be sort of an integrated human being and if&nbsp; you have a reasonably healthy happy childhood&nbsp;&nbsp; and adolescence and you have a reasonably&nbsp; healthy happy normal adulthood you're going&nbsp;&nbsp; to be integrated you're not going to have&nbsp; multiple personality. But the other reason&nbsp;&nbsp; is because it just works better. It's not that&nbsp; integration is the big goal in and of itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just that integration is a way to get&nbsp; to the goal of far far far far less symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp; uh much more happy settled state internally,&nbsp; much better quality of personal relationships,&nbsp;&nbsp; much better functioning in the workplace and&nbsp; huge reduction in the amount of health care and&nbsp;&nbsp; mental health care resources you need. Now, you&nbsp; mentioned that you are uh about to release a book&nbsp;&nbsp; um about mind control. What what specifically&nbsp; will the book deal with and and when will it&nbsp;&nbsp; uh do you expect it to be published? I'm just um&nbsp; I'm working just finished the second draft of the&nbsp;&nbsp; third draft of the book. So, it's been through&nbsp; three complete changes and now the final one&nbsp;&nbsp; I've done a pretty extensive rewrite of it and&nbsp; I've got a little bit more information. I'm just&nbsp;&nbsp; uh sort of digesting and waiting to come in&nbsp; from one of the universities that I got some&nbsp;&nbsp; information from. Um and then I'll probably go&nbsp; over it one more time kind of stylistically and&nbsp;&nbsp; then we'll see if we can get a publisher to bite&nbsp; on it. So, I'm hoping that it'll be out before&nbsp;&nbsp; the end of 97. And and what specifically are you&nbsp; are you dealing with in the book? Um, basically&nbsp;&nbsp; everything that we've been talking about, the main&nbsp; points are going to be that the US military and&nbsp;&nbsp; the CIA have been creating experimental multiple&nbsp; personality and that's an established fact because&nbsp;&nbsp; of the documentation. The extent that those people&nbsp; were used in operations is still not really fully&nbsp;&nbsp; known. uh the fact that you can create artificial&nbsp; multiple personality to me proves both that like I&nbsp;&nbsp; said earlier that it can be created artificially&nbsp; and also that it's likely to arise spontaneously&nbsp;&nbsp; and I go into that in a bunch of detail and then&nbsp; all this other crazy mind control research I use&nbsp;&nbsp; that to set the context to make it believable that&nbsp; multiple personality could been created by the&nbsp;&nbsp; military cuz if you just hear that out of nowhere&nbsp; it just seems too much to believe but when you&nbsp;&nbsp; have that whole context then you realize really&nbsp; just fits in nicely. And then the other part is to&nbsp;&nbsp; try and stimulate either a presidential commission&nbsp; or some sort of public inquiry into this and get&nbsp;&nbsp; the medical ethics of it really tightened up&nbsp; and make sure that this stuff is not ongoing,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? And get some recognition and compensation&nbsp; for the victims. That's basically the gist of the&nbsp;&nbsp; book. Do you have evidence of experimental brain&nbsp; implant surgery being done on epilepsy patients?&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh well there's two answers to that question.&nbsp; One is that all this documented brain electrode&nbsp;&nbsp; implant research that I described some of those&nbsp; patients actually had epilepsy and a whole bunch&nbsp;&nbsp; of them epilepsy was kind of a phony rationale&nbsp; for putting electrodes in. So when you read that&nbsp;&nbsp; literature a lot of the time they'll describe the&nbsp; patient as having epilepsy and then other times&nbsp;&nbsp; they uh actually put brain electrodes in just for&nbsp; either psychiatric reasons which were basically&nbsp;&nbsp; bogus reasons or purely experimental reasons&nbsp; but epilepsy is one of the rationale for putting&nbsp;&nbsp; brain electrodes in that's totally documented.&nbsp; And would these uh people be informed of that&nbsp;&nbsp; they were to receive brain implants or uh yeah&nbsp; but uh the sort of explanation for why that was&nbsp;&nbsp; scientifically justified and the informed consent&nbsp; procedure was really iffy. Yeah. And and what uh&nbsp;&nbsp; what literature is available uh on this subject?&nbsp; Uh there's a book called Violence in the Brain by&nbsp;&nbsp; uh Mark and published if I remember the year&nbsp; like 1970 or 72. it's a little bit hard to get&nbsp;&nbsp; or if you go into part of the problem is you&nbsp; can't do computerized searches of the medical&nbsp;&nbsp; literature before 1966. But if you go to the&nbsp; medical literature in the period 1955 to 1970&nbsp;&nbsp; and you look for publications by Robert Heath&nbsp; at Tlane University or Jose Delgado at Yale,&nbsp;&nbsp; you'll find those scattered around in the&nbsp; medical literature. Okay? Or you just do&nbsp;&nbsp; literature searches on brain electrode implants.&nbsp; Or then there's a huge literature on LSD.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just a matter of really going to the&nbsp; library and and searching around or in the&nbsp;&nbsp; book like I'll reference a lot of it. Well, I'd&nbsp; like to thank you very much, Dr. Colin Ross,&nbsp;&nbsp; for joining us on CKLN. It's been very&nbsp; illuminating talking to you and I I wish&nbsp;&nbsp; you all the best with your your new book. Yeah,&nbsp; my pleasure. Thanks for doing a series on this. We've been listening to an&nbsp; interview with Dr. Dr. Colin Ross,&nbsp;&nbsp; a Canadian psychiatrist working with&nbsp; dissociative identity disorder and&nbsp;&nbsp; has also documented the CIA military&nbsp; mind control experimental programs. Transcripts are available of the lecture that&nbsp; started off this series at the office of CKLN for&nbsp;&nbsp; $2. And the transcripts of this interview will&nbsp; be available in 2 to 3 weeks time at CKLN.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll be back next week with more in the&nbsp; mind control in Canada radio series on&nbsp;&nbsp; the international connection here on 88.1 Calen.",

Welcome to the imagination.&nbsp; I'm your host, Emma, and today I'm honored to have&nbsp;&nbsp; back on the show once again, podcast regular,&nbsp; United Church minister, turned whistleblower,&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian hero, humanitarian, loving father,&nbsp; published writer and author, public speaker&nbsp;&nbsp; and podcaster, documentary filmmaker, Nobel Peace&nbsp; Prize nominee, co-founder of the international&nbsp;&nbsp; tribunal into crimes of church and state,&nbsp; righteous soul, and eagle strong voice,&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin Annet. In case you've missed any of Kevin's&nbsp; past episodes or our movie night feature where we&nbsp;&nbsp; aired his acclaimed documentary, Unrepentant&nbsp; on this channel, here's a brief intro into his&nbsp;&nbsp; testimony and background along with some helpful&nbsp; information on what we'll be talking about today.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin's early life was shaped by compassion and&nbsp; a call to serve as a United Church minister in&nbsp;&nbsp; Port Alurnie, British Columbia in the early&nbsp; 1990s. their indigenous survivors of Canada's&nbsp;&nbsp; residential schools revealed a hidden genocide,&nbsp; abuse, forced sterilizations, and child deaths&nbsp;&nbsp; orchestrated by church and state. Kevin's refusal&nbsp; to stay silent led to his 1997 defrocking, a&nbsp;&nbsp; historic first for political reasons. Undeterred,&nbsp; he documented survivors stories and produced the&nbsp;&nbsp; 2006 documentary Unrepentant, which exposed these&nbsp; atrocities and helped prompt Canada's 2008 apology&nbsp;&nbsp; to indigenous survivors. His investigations&nbsp; reached global elites, including the Vatican,&nbsp;&nbsp; leading him to co-found the International Tribunal&nbsp; into Crimes of Church and State in 2010. His work&nbsp;&nbsp; with the International Common Law Court of Justice&nbsp; contributed to Pope Benedict's 2013 resignation,&nbsp;&nbsp; a historic event linked to allegations of&nbsp; church crime. Despite facing smear campaigns,&nbsp;&nbsp; death threats, and blacklisting, Kevin has&nbsp; earned Nobel Peace Prize nominations for his&nbsp;&nbsp; relentless pursuit of justice. Through his radio&nbsp; program, Here We Stand, in the Republic of Canada,&nbsp;&nbsp; a movement for self-governance under common law,&nbsp; Kevin has inspired thousands to reject centralized&nbsp;&nbsp; power. His tireless advocacy from indigenous&nbsp; communities to international tribunals amplifies&nbsp;&nbsp; the marginalized and challenges the powerful. Now&nbsp; in books he's written like Truthteller Shield,&nbsp;&nbsp; a manual for whistleblowers and Hellraisers,&nbsp; the theory and practice of letting your truth&nbsp;&nbsp; and the truth prevail, which is a powerful manual&nbsp; for empowering whistleblowers and truth tellers,&nbsp;&nbsp; and another book, Governing Ourselves, a handbook&nbsp; on personal, political, and spiritual sovereignty,&nbsp;&nbsp; which we will be discussing and referring to&nbsp; today. Kevin distills his decades of struggle&nbsp;&nbsp; into a powerful guide for liberation. Co-authored&nbsp; with indigenous elders, legal scholars, and global&nbsp;&nbsp; activists, the book is both a manifesto&nbsp; and a practical blueprint. It argues that&nbsp;&nbsp; true freedom begins with reclaiming personal&nbsp; agency, rejecting corporate and state control,&nbsp;&nbsp; and embracing spiritual awakening. Drawing on the&nbsp; Republic of Canada's experiments with common law&nbsp;&nbsp; courts and citizens assemblies, this book offers&nbsp; tools for building self-governing communities&nbsp;&nbsp; rooted in equality and mutual accountability. It&nbsp; is a call to action, urging readers to embody the&nbsp;&nbsp; principle that we are beholden to none, save one&nbsp; another, and the laws we establish. Kevin's life&nbsp;&nbsp; is a testament to the power of one individual&nbsp; to ignite change. From a small church in Port Al&nbsp;&nbsp; Bernie to a global stage, he has exposed truths&nbsp; that shook empires and inspired a movement for&nbsp;&nbsp; sovereignty. As Kevin continues to lead by&nbsp; example, his story reminds us that courage,&nbsp;&nbsp; truth, and solidarity can dismantle even the&nbsp; most entrenched systems of oppression. In a world&nbsp;&nbsp; hungry for freedom, Kevin stands as a beacon,&nbsp; showing us how to govern ourselves and build a&nbsp;&nbsp; future worthy of our highest aspirations. Before&nbsp; wrapping up the introduction of today's guest,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to give just a couple quick reminders and&nbsp; updates.

The one,&nbsp;&nbsp; the only Kevin Annit. Kevin, thank you so much for&nbsp; being here with us again today. It's always such&nbsp;&nbsp; an honor to have you on. Oh, it's always a joy to&nbsp; be back. Thank you, Emma. You're so welcome. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; excited for for today's topic and you know, we've&nbsp; had some really great podcast episodes. The thing&nbsp;&nbsp; I was telling you before we started recording&nbsp; that I really love about working with you is&nbsp;&nbsp; you're so knowledgeable about so much. So, there's&nbsp; so much that we can talk about whether it's as a&nbsp;&nbsp; big picture or sort of a focused detail. And so,&nbsp; today I'm really excited for this conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think it's really going to help people&nbsp; feel empowered to take their sovereignty into&nbsp;&nbsp; their own hands and to sort of have a direction on&nbsp; how to do that. So I thought maybe we could start&nbsp;&nbsp; um you're actually working with some groups right&nbsp; now helping produce and manifest in real life&nbsp;&nbsp; this exact topic that we're talking about today&nbsp; personal and um sovereignty throughout a nation&nbsp;&nbsp; or throughout a community. And so I thought I&nbsp; would give you an opportunity to share a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit about that because it's really revolutionary&nbsp; what you're doing. Well, in what other more and&nbsp;&nbsp; more people are doing um in two places in America&nbsp; and England this last month there's been a real&nbsp;&nbsp; coalescing of people who some of whom we inspired&nbsp; but other people have just come forward. It's kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of like this hundth monkey phenomenon. People have&nbsp; just come from everywhere all of a sudden and I&nbsp;&nbsp; mean that is reflected in the fact that we sold&nbsp; over 1,200 of my books in the last two months.&nbsp;&nbsp; normally in the same period of time would sell&nbsp; maybe 50 or 100. So it's going through the roof&nbsp;&nbsp; now this interest and yeah you you mentioned this&nbsp; book and they both both in America and England&nbsp;&nbsp; these new groups are relying heavily on this. I'll&nbsp; tell you about them. First of all, uh in England&nbsp;&nbsp; for a number of years, people have been trying to&nbsp; they've shown kind of a passive interest in what&nbsp;&nbsp; we're doing in Canada because we're facing the&nbsp; same uh institution of the crown, right? And this&nbsp;&nbsp; last month, a organizing committee has formed&nbsp; to establish a republic, sovereign republic in&nbsp;&nbsp; England called the Republic of Albon. Albio N.&nbsp; And uh that's a traditional Gaelic word. It kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of embraces a lot of the culture there and um it&nbsp; also reflects the fact that historically there&nbsp;&nbsp; was a republic in England. It's in under Cromwell&nbsp; and the Puritans when they cut off the c the head&nbsp;&nbsp; of the king Charles um in 1649 for 11 years they&nbsp; had a republic. Parliament abolished the monarchy&nbsp;&nbsp; and the house of lords and said it was a crime of&nbsp; treason to reestablish the British monarchy. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, Charles II comes along, does a military coup,&nbsp; overthrows the republic, and reestablishes the&nbsp;&nbsp; monarchy, but it was never a dour or lawful power.&nbsp; It was kind of a de facto coup, but it it's never&nbsp;&nbsp; had, in other words, the British crown has not&nbsp; had lawful authority since 1649. It's a power,&nbsp;&nbsp; but not a lawful one. And that really helped us&nbsp; when we set up the Republican Kennetic as we said,&nbsp;&nbsp; look, it's always been a fiction, literally&nbsp; the authority of the crown. Well, the folks&nbsp;&nbsp; in England, they've now reached a critical mass&nbsp; and they now have organizing committees in four&nbsp;&nbsp; different areas in Ireland because there is&nbsp; kind of a cultural and historical affinity&nbsp;&nbsp; in the north of Ireland, um Scotland, Wales, and&nbsp; England. Okay? And they they have a flag uh which&nbsp;&nbsp; they're just uh I'll send it to you later. You can&nbsp; post it. We uh they're just in the process of kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of finalizing it, but it'll have the symbols&nbsp; of those four cultures on it. and um uh they&nbsp;&nbsp; have agreed to very much follow the setting kind&nbsp; of the outline we did in Canada which is they've&nbsp;&nbsp; uh decided on a constitution they're going to go&nbsp; public and say look this is not just replacing a&nbsp;&nbsp; figurehead uh knocking out a king and putting&nbsp; in a president right this is an transformation&nbsp;&nbsp; from the grassroots so they're they'll be setting&nbsp; up as we did uh local republic assemblies courts&nbsp;&nbsp; um their own sheriffs to enforce it, making&nbsp; the appeal to people to switch allegiance,&nbsp;&nbsp; nullify their oath of allegiance to Charles&nbsp; and the crown and take it to constitution. So&nbsp;&nbsp; reviving the republic, that's in their tradition.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, it was interesting because&nbsp;&nbsp; after the republic got overthrown, a lot of those&nbsp; folks came to came to America to New England.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um it was interesting early on people know the&nbsp; story of the Mayflower landing at Plymouth Rock&nbsp;&nbsp; in 1620. 50 years following that uh there were um&nbsp; people who used to be in the new model army who&nbsp;&nbsp; fought with Cromwell who had come over refugees&nbsp; from England and these folks wrote out the early&nbsp;&nbsp; statements in Connecticut and Plymouth of what&nbsp; their republic should look like. that is they&nbsp;&nbsp; formed the first covenant the first real identity&nbsp; the new identity people had that we are Americans&nbsp;&nbsp; because we are governing ourselves we're not&nbsp; beholden to any ruler any monarch you know&nbsp;&nbsp; um and so there was that continuity you know from&nbsp; England to America and the same thing's happening&nbsp;&nbsp; now because part two of this is in America there&nbsp; is uh now we're in touch with people in uh 14&nbsp;&nbsp; different states who are interested in this and&nbsp; what they're doing is they want to issue a new&nbsp;&nbsp; Declaration of Independence against the existing&nbsp; system and they've they've united Democrats and&nbsp;&nbsp; Republicans because they've lost the old labels.&nbsp; These are Americans who are saying one of the the&nbsp;&nbsp; people had at one of these meetings I took part&nbsp; in on a Zoom call. They had a big flag on the&nbsp;&nbsp; wall that said neither Republican nor Democrat but&nbsp; American going back to the roots of who we all are&nbsp;&nbsp; and making that that unity again. And people are&nbsp; so hungering for that, right? and um you know this&nbsp;&nbsp; divisive conflict that's been going on. people now&nbsp; in America are saying we need a new declaration to&nbsp;&nbsp; remind us of what to recover our soul to remind&nbsp; us at the heart of America is the fact that not&nbsp;&nbsp; only are all people created equal but they remain&nbsp; equal and they've got to establish their own way&nbsp;&nbsp; to govern themselves in in the law in politics in&nbsp; everything so that all the citizens are involved&nbsp;&nbsp; that you know for example there should be no laws&nbsp; passed in which we haven't had a say the best laws&nbsp;&nbsp; come out of our own communities where people get&nbsp; together and say what do we want how do we want&nbsp;&nbsp; our communities to be and work that away from the&nbsp; grassroots. So it's really exciting. They want to&nbsp;&nbsp; issue this. They haven't set a date but they're&nbsp; they're holding like what happened in 1770s. U&nbsp;&nbsp; they're holding constitutional conventions all&nbsp; over and they're making an appeal to people to&nbsp;&nbsp; come out from these labels of Republican Democrat.&nbsp; Forget about the politicians no matter who they&nbsp;&nbsp; are. This is not an attack on anyone. It's an&nbsp; a reminder of America is a lot more than its&nbsp;&nbsp; politicians or its government. It's in the heart&nbsp; and soul of the people and we're trying to recover&nbsp;&nbsp; that soul. So it was beautiful. I was had tears&nbsp; in my eyes after talking to these folks because&nbsp;&nbsp; it's like you know finally it's happening where&nbsp; it should because I still believe that America&nbsp;&nbsp; and what it embodies is the hope of the world in&nbsp; the sense that you know the common law republic&nbsp;&nbsp; was a fact here. It wasn't just an nice nice idea.&nbsp; It's it's it keeps rising up through slavery and&nbsp;&nbsp; through all of these wrong turns that the country&nbsp; took. There's this this kind of gyroscope that&nbsp;&nbsp; keeps bringing us back on course all the time,&nbsp; right? It and and and that's a sign that the whole&nbsp;&nbsp; world needs in this age of the corportocracy.&nbsp; It's either a republic or this corporate monolith&nbsp;&nbsp; that's at the heart of all of these problems and&nbsp; crimes we've been talking about. So, those are two&nbsp;&nbsp; really exciting developments. And um of course,&nbsp; they want me to come over to England in the fall&nbsp;&nbsp; and I'll be down in the States as well helping&nbsp; with all this. But, oh my gosh, it's really great.&nbsp;&nbsp; me. I love that people are finding your work and&nbsp; starting to learn about these things. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't believe that this stuff isn't common&nbsp; knowledge to people living in society. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; people are just now finding out about this decades&nbsp; into their life and saying, \"Oh, wait. I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; have to accept what's always been there. I can&nbsp; use my voice and get a group of people together&nbsp;&nbsp; and make a change.\" And I really love that you're&nbsp; being brought in on behalf of um these different&nbsp;&nbsp; movements especially that have to do with politics&nbsp; because unfortunately you know politics I think&nbsp;&nbsp; was rooted in maybe doing something good and&nbsp; creating law and order. However, throughout time&nbsp;&nbsp; and and especially now, the only purpose it really&nbsp; serves is to get people to hate one another. And&nbsp;&nbsp; it creates these little pockets of division and&nbsp; really compartmentalizes people from their own&nbsp;&nbsp; communities, you know, and then they get so caught&nbsp; up in idolizing these people that don't know them,&nbsp;&nbsp; that don't give a crap about them, you know, and&nbsp; and ultimately we're destroying ourselves from&nbsp;&nbsp; the inside out because these policies have been&nbsp; so inverted to work against us, you know. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; I really love that you're seeing people sick of&nbsp; that and saying, \"What are we doing?\" You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; let's all unite together in our own communities&nbsp; and and as a nation and throw out these different&nbsp;&nbsp; divisive tactics. We're better together. And&nbsp; that really says a lot about your work and the&nbsp;&nbsp; way that you've presented it that way. Right. And&nbsp; that's, you know, the power of this book and and&nbsp;&nbsp; the folks in America and England both said the&nbsp; same thing about this even though they hadn't&nbsp;&nbsp; been in communication. They're all just observing&nbsp; this that the power of this it combines all three&nbsp;&nbsp; personal political spiritual and I go into detail&nbsp; of what that looks like and not just me there was&nbsp;&nbsp; this was actually co-written with five other&nbsp; people people in our republic movement in in&nbsp;&nbsp; also from other countries uh you know like&nbsp; Tom House he's a traditional Ojiway elder&nbsp;&nbsp; who I've known for many years who is sits on&nbsp; the national council of the republic in Canada&nbsp;&nbsp; um and so when you said politics the you know&nbsp; in here We explain that the word comes from the&nbsp;&nbsp; Greek word polus p o l i s and all that meant in&nbsp; in the Greek language was the city because they&nbsp;&nbsp; were referring to Athens which was the first place&nbsp; in the world that people practice participatory&nbsp;&nbsp; democracy not representative where you sign your&nbsp; authority away to one guy and he does whatever&nbsp;&nbsp; he wants and you only have a say you know at the&nbsp; next election. Somebody did a funny cartoon. It&nbsp;&nbsp; shows a guy in a holding up a piece of paper paper&nbsp; and there's 10 X's on it and he says here's your&nbsp;&nbsp; lifetime ration of democracy, right? 10 crosses&nbsp; every time you vote. And Jeanjac Rouso in the&nbsp;&nbsp; social contract in the 1700s he wrote that he said&nbsp; in the English system of representative democracy&nbsp;&nbsp; you only have a moment of freedom when you choose&nbsp; somebody but then you lose freedom again because&nbsp;&nbsp; they are representing you right that's not&nbsp; the Athenian model. 500 years before Christ,&nbsp;&nbsp; they had a model in ancient Athens which&nbsp; was better than what we brought now. And&nbsp;&nbsp; first of all, every citizen was expected to&nbsp; participate. So they had big assemblies and&nbsp;&nbsp; um now of course citizen meant the non-slaves&nbsp; and women of course weren't included. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; so there's that. But in terms of their world,&nbsp; all of the males had the right and and duty,&nbsp;&nbsp; not just the right, but the obligation to attend&nbsp; these big assemblies where they were pass laws and&nbsp;&nbsp; they would all take turns in being the archon,&nbsp; which was like the the lawmaker. Um, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and to enforce the laws and to sit in the courts&nbsp; and everything. So, you draw lots and say, \"Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; Emma's the judge this month.\" Okay. No, you&nbsp; got to take that responsibility. That way,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's always shared. It's equalized, right? the&nbsp; responsibility and the power. And not only that,&nbsp;&nbsp; but we get the word ostracize, okay, from this&nbsp; Greek word ostrachon. And that was a little piece&nbsp;&nbsp; of pottery. And whenever they didn't like somebody&nbsp; who was in power, they'd write his name on the&nbsp;&nbsp; ostrachon and vote him out. He'd be ostracized. He&nbsp; would be removed from office. He was accountable&nbsp;&nbsp; at all times. So it was kind of like a contract.&nbsp; You have a contract with somebody. You say, \"Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll do this if you do this.\" But if either side&nbsp; violates a contract, boom, you can walk. It's null&nbsp;&nbsp; on board right away. That's the way government&nbsp; should be. You know, um if if people have voted&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody to we don't use the word representative&nbsp; in the Republic of Canada. We we say delegate&nbsp;&nbsp; because they're delegated to do a job by the&nbsp; people. If they don't do the job, the people go,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're out. Because the power resides, like any&nbsp; American who reads their constitutions knows,&nbsp;&nbsp; the power resides in the people. There isn't a&nbsp; government separate from the will of the people.&nbsp;&nbsp; People combine and create a government and they&nbsp; can remove it at any time. That's the simple idea&nbsp;&nbsp; that that we're reviving in in people that that&nbsp; memory, right? Um and so we go into the detail&nbsp;&nbsp; first about the political and um there there's you&nbsp; know the personal spiritual is is other aspects we&nbsp;&nbsp; can talk about as well. Absolutely. I wanted you&nbsp; to I would love for people to purchase this book.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, one thing I really love about your books,&nbsp; and I mentioned this to you before we came on,&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't write books leading people to different&nbsp; cliffhers of keep buying, keep buying, depend on&nbsp;&nbsp; me to give you, you know, to lead you to where you&nbsp; need to be. You write the literal blueprints of&nbsp;&nbsp; how somebody can empower themselves 100% and not&nbsp; need anybody to do so in your books. And I think&nbsp;&nbsp; this one is a really great example of about that.&nbsp; And I wanted you to just maybe share anything else&nbsp;&nbsp; that you wanted people to know about it because&nbsp; I think this is a really important one especially&nbsp;&nbsp; because you do cover the personal, political, and&nbsp; spiritual aspects of our sovereignty. And this is&nbsp;&nbsp; on Amazon for people listening. Um you can get it&nbsp; from Kevin's website, too. It'll take you right to&nbsp;&nbsp; the Amazon page. Um I'll link both and and we'll&nbsp; have a couple other book recommendations too on&nbsp;&nbsp; these topics for you guys. Right. So the uh we&nbsp; start in the book with the political because&nbsp;&nbsp; that kind of affects everybody. But part two is&nbsp; spiritual sovereignty. And the example I use to&nbsp;&nbsp; best understand this because everyone it's kind&nbsp; of a funny term. I make a distinction in the book&nbsp;&nbsp; between religion and spirituality. And I say well&nbsp; religion is kind of like comparing religion and&nbsp;&nbsp; spirituality is if if uh spirit which is from&nbsp; the Greek word numa breath right it's inherent&nbsp;&nbsp; in all of us. But religion is kind of like the&nbsp; weather report describing the wind, right? It&nbsp;&nbsp; it's describing something all the time. And and&nbsp; it comes from the a word in Latin meaning to tie&nbsp;&nbsp; people together religion. So it's it's this kind&nbsp; of a natural bringing everyone together in one&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of group. I mean that's like a a how empires&nbsp; operate, right? But spirit is inherent within all&nbsp;&nbsp; of us like our rights, like you know the common&nbsp; law, all of that. And by analogy in America,&nbsp;&nbsp; the way it happened was remember I mentioned&nbsp; the folks who came over from England as kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; refugees when the monarchy was reestablished. They&nbsp; were instrumental in in um the first principle was&nbsp;&nbsp; in our because we were seeking their independence&nbsp; as a spiritual communities, right? Uh the Puritans&nbsp;&nbsp; and others, they didn't want a king or a pope.&nbsp; They they believed in Christ as the head of&nbsp;&nbsp; the church. And to practice that they set up&nbsp; their own self-governing congregations where&nbsp;&nbsp; they would elect their own minister, right? And&nbsp; like Baptists today in America, they do the same&nbsp;&nbsp; thing. You can as a you see this all the time.&nbsp; You don't need a theological education. There's&nbsp;&nbsp; no church hierarchy. Every congregation, every&nbsp; community governs themselves and they elect their&nbsp;&nbsp; own minister, right? Um that was the model among&nbsp; the Puritans in the 1600s when they're up there in&nbsp;&nbsp; New England. Well, naturally the political system&nbsp; evolved out of that because in their town meetings&nbsp;&nbsp; and everything, they said, \"Well, we're we govern&nbsp; ourselves spiritually. Why wouldn't we politically&nbsp;&nbsp; as well?\" So, when you have that sense that we're&nbsp; all endowed by the creator with the same nature,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? We're all part of that oneness, why would&nbsp; we have a hierarchy? We don't have a hierarchy&nbsp;&nbsp; spiritually. Why would we have one politically&nbsp; and invest all power in a few people like who can,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, pass laws without a permission, write&nbsp; executive orders, and everybody has to go along&nbsp;&nbsp; with it? That's got nothing to do with true&nbsp; self-governance and what America's all about. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it it evolved naturally from the spiritual&nbsp; sovereign into the political. And uh the the&nbsp;&nbsp; personal is a a harder one in a way to deal with.&nbsp; Um, let me we'll get into that, but let me just&nbsp;&nbsp; if you have any comments or questions about any of&nbsp; that. Yeah, I would love to get more into it. And&nbsp;&nbsp; before we do, um, I wanted to bring up a couple&nbsp; other book recommendations that we were going to&nbsp;&nbsp; share real quick. Um, just on these topics,&nbsp; um, because again, I think I think your work&nbsp;&nbsp; is really important and it's so affordable. It's&nbsp; right here on Amazon. People can get it in just a&nbsp;&nbsp; couple days. Um, and so I would love to just help&nbsp; set up people for, you know, that for that freedom&nbsp;&nbsp; and sovereignty and to learn more about it. So I&nbsp; thought maybe if you wanted to just talk a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit about the case for for Canada and then also&nbsp; the whistleblowers manual real quick and then we&nbsp;&nbsp; can dig deeper into topics into personal we'll go&nbsp; back to the personal sovereignty because that's&nbsp;&nbsp; really important one. Um, okay. Yeah. Case for&nbsp; Canada. So this was uh in 2015 in January we had a&nbsp;&nbsp; convention in Winnipeg over 200 delegates about a&nbsp; third of them indigenous people and we established&nbsp;&nbsp; the framework like what they're doing right now&nbsp; in England there had creating a constitution&nbsp;&nbsp; which really embodies the vision of what the&nbsp; republic should be and um we adopted originally&nbsp;&nbsp; we had a flag with an eagle on a tree and then&nbsp; the native people said well what about the two&nbsp;&nbsp; row wampam now the two wampam was the first&nbsp; original treaty between the eastern woodland&nbsp;&nbsp; natives and the Europeans when they came over. And&nbsp; the Europeans needed the natives in the east, both&nbsp;&nbsp; in America and Canada, because they were important&nbsp; in the fur trade. They were military allies when&nbsp;&nbsp; the French and the English were fighting each&nbsp; other. And so it was expedient for the Europeans&nbsp;&nbsp; to sign this treaty. And but what it said is that&nbsp; these two represent the the blue lines represent&nbsp;&nbsp; the Europeans and the indigenous going down&nbsp; the river together. One in their own ship, one&nbsp;&nbsp; in their own canoe. And that was the notion that&nbsp; we will share the land together. It won't be one&nbsp;&nbsp; over another. Right now the Europeans went against&nbsp; that. They broke that covenant with the natives,&nbsp;&nbsp; of course. Um like in America they said natives&nbsp; are just like they still say they're um they're&nbsp;&nbsp; like dependencies on the there's only America&nbsp; law and we don't recognize native sovereignty&nbsp;&nbsp; or anything like that. And in Canada is worse&nbsp; because they're all wards of the crown which means&nbsp;&nbsp; they don't even have legal status. They're not&nbsp; citizens. So Europeans kind of abregated that but&nbsp;&nbsp; indigen the traditional native people still hold&nbsp; to it and say our vision is that we will share&nbsp;&nbsp; the land together and that's what the Republic&nbsp; of Canada is. It's the model for it is it's a&nbsp;&nbsp; federation of different sovereign nations within&nbsp; the one umbrella of Canada and um that and the&nbsp;&nbsp; three stars represent the English, the French and&nbsp; the indigenous founding nations. So in the book we&nbsp;&nbsp; lay out how we put that vision into practice with&nbsp; the assemblies. Um also training people and that's&nbsp;&nbsp; why you know I'm so glad about the show today&nbsp; because I hope we can use it as a practical kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of training school. uh like this a visual manual&nbsp; of what we're talking about with people who've&nbsp;&nbsp; gone from the 90% of people who are still watching&nbsp; and and kind of not sure to the minority who are&nbsp;&nbsp; taking the next step to organize and put this into&nbsp; practice. And what we saying here all the time is&nbsp;&nbsp; uh you have to understand your own history as a&nbsp; people. Not what you get taught in school but the&nbsp;&nbsp; living history. And we've described that like we&nbsp; go into detail about like there was an attempted&nbsp;&nbsp; rebellion in Canada against the crown in 1837 and&nbsp; it got defeated. It's one of the reasons the crown&nbsp;&nbsp; and the church has had such power here. Um but&nbsp; all of that is again based on a fraudulent power&nbsp;&nbsp; called the crown. We can revoke and step out of&nbsp; it at any point. And we we give people a kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; how-to process of of just like we do in the common&nbsp; law training manual about how to set up a common&nbsp;&nbsp; law court. We showed you how on the ground you can&nbsp; do this. And we've had some really great times,&nbsp;&nbsp; some fun times. Like for example, uh when we&nbsp; formed the assembly in Vancouver, we went out&nbsp;&nbsp; uh and did a flag raising. We had a bag piper. It&nbsp; was so stirring. It was a Scottish in me coming&nbsp;&nbsp; out, right? It just brought tears to my eyes. This&nbsp; bag piper was playing. There was a whole group of&nbsp;&nbsp; us there and we brought down the Canadian flag&nbsp; and raised the Republic of Canada flag, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; And then there was about two dozen people there&nbsp; uh who were newcomers. They all in unison took&nbsp;&nbsp; the oath of allegiance to the republic. So they&nbsp; revoked their their allegiance to Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;&nbsp; and her descendants and the Canadian government&nbsp; and laws and we took it to the the republic and&nbsp;&nbsp; they signed their citizenship cards. And at that&nbsp; point they operated within their own jurisdiction&nbsp;&nbsp; and that is so powerful when people do that&nbsp; together because then they say okay we have an&nbsp;&nbsp; obligation to protect each other now to work with&nbsp; each other. It's kind of a glue that brings people&nbsp;&nbsp; together rather than just another idea floating&nbsp; around the internet that never like I say it's&nbsp;&nbsp; uh ideas by themselves are like steam okay it&nbsp; dissipates all over u but but a when you're doing&nbsp;&nbsp; u the republic and the common courts you need a&nbsp; piston to move the steam so the rather the steam&nbsp;&nbsp; moves the piston that's you bring together the&nbsp; vision the spirit with the practical organization&nbsp;&nbsp; And then you get movement. But you can't&nbsp; have it without with steam or a piston on&nbsp;&nbsp; on them by themselves. Don't do it. You need&nbsp; their combination. And that's how we view this&nbsp;&nbsp; work. You know, the ideas are the first step in&nbsp; the discussion, but it's got to lead to these&nbsp;&nbsp; practical operations. You know, so we're thinking&nbsp; I say to people, don't think theoretically&nbsp;&nbsp; anymore. Think operationally, right? And think of&nbsp; how you're going to put it into operation in your&nbsp;&nbsp; own neighborhood. Absolutely. And then we have&nbsp; gone over this one in depth on um on a another&nbsp;&nbsp; episode. Um but this is one of my favorite books&nbsp; just because it really fits the theme over all of&nbsp;&nbsp; this podcast and people listening, but I think it&nbsp; also definitely complements the topic today which&nbsp;&nbsp; is your whistleblower manual. Yeah. Well, I mean,&nbsp; I had fun writing it because I was just drawing on&nbsp;&nbsp; my own experience and writing it in a very kind of&nbsp; basic way for people. So, that um honestly, okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; we're dealing with big institutions and that's to&nbsp; our advantage because they have a set way they can&nbsp;&nbsp; operate, but we can maneuver. We have the freedom&nbsp; to to outmaneuver them. And here's how you do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I kind of lead it through. first thing they're&nbsp; going to do if you're ever targeted for anything&nbsp;&nbsp; uh and you you hold some evidence or some&nbsp; important information that they don't want coming&nbsp;&nbsp; out, the first thing they're going to do to you is&nbsp; is it's all about silence in you. So, they don't&nbsp;&nbsp; want to get too heavy because that draws more&nbsp; attention to you. So, they seduce you by saying,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, oh, we can work this out. Uh, just don't go&nbsp; to the press. We can work this out. Now, most&nbsp;&nbsp; people want to do that. They don't want to have a&nbsp; confrontation. If they think they can, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; work it out with any hassle, they will. What? And&nbsp; that that's what happened to me. They said, \"Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; let's negotiate.\" When they fired me without cause&nbsp; highlighted these disappeared children and the&nbsp;&nbsp; land deals and everything going on, the land theft&nbsp; by the church and big money and the government,&nbsp;&nbsp; they said they we went into negotiation, but&nbsp; all that did stretched out over four months. At&nbsp;&nbsp; the end, they canled the negotiations. It was&nbsp; just designed to tie me up so that I couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; go public with stuff. And that gave them the&nbsp; time to destroy evidence, silence witnesses,&nbsp;&nbsp; arrange their own narrative so that when I&nbsp; did go public, they could say, \"Oh yeah, well,&nbsp;&nbsp; we've we know about, you know, Kevin, he's got a&nbsp; bad history, blah, blah, blah.\" They had all their&nbsp;&nbsp; PR guys in place. They needed time to do that.&nbsp; So, what I say to people in here is that whenever&nbsp;&nbsp; you're you're holding important evidence and&nbsp; you're willing to go public with it, just do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't wait for anybody else. Don't rely on&nbsp; your adversary to do the right thing because&nbsp;&nbsp; they never will. They're they have two priorities&nbsp; in a corporation whether it's church, government,&nbsp;&nbsp; business, anybody. Um efficiency and growth,&nbsp; right? They have to hold on and these are machine&nbsp;&nbsp; priorities not human priorities, right? and uh&nbsp; they have to sustain themselves and people you&nbsp;&nbsp; know inconvenient whistleblowers or whoever get&nbsp; in the way of that. So they have a whole protocol&nbsp;&nbsp; that we've learned about how they deal with people&nbsp; like us. And so we go into all the lessons of that&nbsp;&nbsp; and of course Sunsu and the art of war. I say to&nbsp; people, if you really want an education, go to&nbsp;&nbsp; the back of this book and read the 50 points, the&nbsp; excerpts from SunSu. And um you know, you'll learn&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot right there because uh something as basic&nbsp; as never operate on the terrain of your enemy or&nbsp;&nbsp; you've lost the battle. And that's what everybody&nbsp; does. When you get upset, what do you do? You have&nbsp;&nbsp; a protest. Well, they're ready for protests.&nbsp; They want protests, you know, because you're,&nbsp;&nbsp; no matter how angry or determined people are,&nbsp; you're still asking for something from somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; in authority and all they have to do is ignore you&nbsp; and there goes your power. But if you don't worry&nbsp;&nbsp; about asking like we did eventually after many&nbsp; mistakes and years of struggle on this, we said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Okay, well, we'll set up our commonal courts&nbsp; and put you guys on trial. Now you have to answer&nbsp;&nbsp; this.\" And look at the disproportionate effect.&nbsp; Two dozen of us force out the truth in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp; We go on to force rat singinger out of power&nbsp; because they don't know what to do when you're&nbsp;&nbsp; taking the initiative all the time and you know&nbsp; it's always basic strategy that you have to hold&nbsp;&nbsp; that initiative at all time and set the train of&nbsp; battle and do everything on your terms and that's&nbsp;&nbsp; in a way kind of leads us to the whole issue of&nbsp; personal sovereignty because that's difficult for&nbsp;&nbsp; people because we haven't learned that we haven't&nbsp; learned how to govern ourselves yet but this is&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the ways you learn by learning. You know,&nbsp; the best teacher is a black eye, right? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; you learn from it. And as long as you don't&nbsp; give up and it's a tragedy when people give up&nbsp;&nbsp; because then how do they apply all the brutality&nbsp; they've been through? How do you pass it on to&nbsp;&nbsp; the people if you're just going to crawl away and&nbsp; die somewhere? So, we can't do that. We've got to&nbsp;&nbsp; share at all times what we've been through with&nbsp; each other, right? 100%. Yes. And like I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; these books are all on Amazon. I would highly&nbsp; recommend purchasing them and especially if&nbsp;&nbsp; you guys know other people who are are sort of&nbsp; thought leaders like you. These make really great&nbsp;&nbsp; gifts or recommendations also and they support&nbsp; Kevin so he can keep doing this work. So these&nbsp;&nbsp; are all on Amazon. Um the truth tellers shield&nbsp; the whistleblower manual. Um like I said that&nbsp;&nbsp; one can really apply to to anybody and everybody&nbsp; watching this channel. I think that's something&nbsp;&nbsp; that's a theme throughout every single episode&nbsp; is is that courage and sometimes there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; to learn in the hardest things that we could ever&nbsp; go through and these conversations demonstrate&nbsp;&nbsp; that and hearing Kevin's personal experience um&nbsp; is really inspiring for what he's learned as a&nbsp;&nbsp; whistleblower and they're very positive things.&nbsp; And we also just did an episode with Juliet Engel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um that was really along those lines also on that&nbsp; personal sovereignty and and whistleblowing and&nbsp;&nbsp; lessons learned and how to keep going. So I'm&nbsp; going to have that episode linked below. If you&nbsp;&nbsp; guys missed that one, definitely go back and watch&nbsp; it. It was a really beautiful episode. But Kevin,&nbsp;&nbsp; let's talk more about the personal aspect of&nbsp; this. Right. So, um, we're raised in a culture&nbsp;&nbsp; that's very atomized and individualized. So, we&nbsp; talk about individual rights like they're an end&nbsp;&nbsp; in themselves rather than just part of a bigger&nbsp; collective. And um the the genius of the American&nbsp;&nbsp; Constitution was that they balance both. Like it&nbsp; said, we have unalienable liberties. Nobody can&nbsp;&nbsp; can take those from you. They're born in you, but&nbsp; they only exist when you practice them. But you&nbsp;&nbsp; don't practice them in isolation from everybody&nbsp; else because I mean the the best quote about that&nbsp;&nbsp; was right as the Civil War was starting in 1861.&nbsp; Abraham Lincoln um let me read this. He said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Many of our countrymen speak of liberty and we&nbsp; are much in want of a proper definition of the&nbsp;&nbsp; word. Some men see liberty as a right to do&nbsp; what they will with themselves while others&nbsp;&nbsp; see it as a right to do what they will with&nbsp; other men.\" Referring to slavery. Right? Here&nbsp;&nbsp; we have two different and mutually exclusive&nbsp; understandings of the same word yet each side&nbsp;&nbsp; calling it the same thing, liberty. Right? So&nbsp; when people say freedom, what are they talking&nbsp;&nbsp; about? Is it like my freedom to do whatever&nbsp; I want? No. Uh in the French Constitution,&nbsp;&nbsp; in the French Revolution, they said in 1792, they&nbsp; said freedom is the right to do anything that&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't harm another. Okay? So that's a simple&nbsp; thing. your right doesn't then boom cross over&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody else's right and then it's not a right&nbsp; it's a privilege and I experienced that when we&nbsp;&nbsp; formed the first assemblies um because in some&nbsp; of these communities the people were fairly well&nbsp;&nbsp; off I remember we had a on Vancouver Island in a&nbsp; place called Parksville we had a meeting in this&nbsp;&nbsp; guy's it was a mansion it was like a really big&nbsp; big house and a lot of these other people were&nbsp;&nbsp; either retired or they had professions they had&nbsp; good careers but they were upset about the COVID&nbsp;&nbsp; restrictions Right. And they didn't want to have&nbsp; the restrictions. And I said, \"Well, actually,&nbsp;&nbsp; these restrictions have been on a lot of people.\"&nbsp; And they they said, \"What do you mean?\" I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Oh, well, native people under the Indian Act, you&nbsp; can't refuse medical treatment. Like since 1874,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's been like that in Canada.\" Um, they had to&nbsp; have special passes to leave the reservation or&nbsp;&nbsp; they' go to jail. And they still operate under&nbsp; that. And they're all sitting there. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; but what does that have to do with CO? And I&nbsp; said, \"Well, why do you think they can get away&nbsp;&nbsp; with CO?\" because they were trying it out on&nbsp; all these other groups. So, we've got to see&nbsp;&nbsp; beyond our living room here and they didn't like&nbsp; that. Some people thought it was cool, but most&nbsp;&nbsp; people were threatened by that. And frankly, that&nbsp; assembly fell apart quick because they were just&nbsp;&nbsp; thinking of themselves and they wanted to hold.&nbsp; And I said, well, if a right is just for you,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a privilege and you're trying to hold on&nbsp; to a privilege. But a right only exists when&nbsp;&nbsp; it's for everybody. Okay? everybody including the&nbsp; ones they're calling you know illegal immigrants&nbsp;&nbsp; and all that we're all human beings we all have&nbsp; the right you know a country based on immigration&nbsp;&nbsp; the country that grew up because you know the&nbsp; statue of liberty there saying you're welcome&nbsp;&nbsp; because we want the model of the republic to be&nbsp; shared with everyone all over the world you know&nbsp;&nbsp; um so that idea of individual versus collective&nbsp; in the American constitution the idea was that you&nbsp;&nbsp; only get individual liberties is secured when the&nbsp; whole republic is intact. Like John Adams said,&nbsp;&nbsp; unless we have a virtuous citizenry, you can't&nbsp; have a republic. A virtuous people are always&nbsp;&nbsp; thinking of their neighbor. They're not just&nbsp; thinking of themselves. They want to take care of&nbsp;&nbsp; the neighbor. And I was raised that way in my my&nbsp; family in Winnipeg because we were descended from&nbsp;&nbsp; this kind of extended Scottish clan. And in the&nbsp; Scottish clan system, like with the indigenous,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, everybody takes care of everybody else. You&nbsp; don't I was raised to think and to and to practice&nbsp;&nbsp; um you don't worry about yourself. You worry about&nbsp; each other and then you hold each other up. The&nbsp;&nbsp; individual is sacri but only as part of the nation&nbsp; right and um and so that's how they come together.&nbsp;&nbsp; The personal but people of raised in a very&nbsp; individualistic culture um you know me me first&nbsp;&nbsp; and they equate that with liberty. it doesn't&nbsp; work. Um because you're always fighting somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; else and guess who profits from that. You know,&nbsp; when everyone's fighting everybody else, you get&nbsp;&nbsp; a few elites coming in and they say, \"Well, then&nbsp; trust me.\" Right? Um and and it was interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another really good guy to read is his name is&nbsp; Alexis Dtoqueville and he was a French nobleman&nbsp;&nbsp; uh aristocrat who came to America in the 1830s.&nbsp; He wrote a book called Democracy in America.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as an outsider, it's brilliant because he sees&nbsp; things that Americans don't. And he said, \"America&nbsp;&nbsp; will be prone to dictatorship because everyone and&nbsp; every farmer,\" he went around the country and look&nbsp;&nbsp; because most people are living on the land and&nbsp; they had their own farm and everything, very few&nbsp;&nbsp; of them were city dwellers. And he said, \"Everyone&nbsp; is so concerned about their individual liberty,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is unique. You don't see that in in Europe,&nbsp; the idea of individual rights, but everyone is so&nbsp;&nbsp; concerned about their own life that the the job of&nbsp; politics and governance will be then handed over&nbsp;&nbsp; to a few people and that will lead to tyranny. So&nbsp; America has that that black and white kind of two&nbsp;&nbsp; aspects, two-headed aspects to them. You know,&nbsp; everyone's talking about liberty, but in fact,&nbsp;&nbsp; look at, you know, the electoral college system.&nbsp; The Supreme Court are all political appointees.&nbsp;&nbsp; um you know a few people in charge get the&nbsp; right to say well we don't agree with the&nbsp;&nbsp; election results us electors should put this&nbsp; guy in instead of the one who got most votes&nbsp;&nbsp; right I mean that's that was all designed to keep&nbsp; power in the hands of a few while talking about&nbsp;&nbsp; liberty for all so we've got to get from kind of&nbsp; that's why the thing in America is so exciting&nbsp;&nbsp; this new development because we're getting back&nbsp; to the original notion that the I is part of we&nbsp;&nbsp; and they're not separate at all and um so anyway&nbsp; That's a new idea for some people, but it's really&nbsp;&nbsp; at the heart of what liberty really is about&nbsp; if it's meant for everybody. Right. Right. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of piggybacking off of the Declaration&nbsp; of Independence here in America, what does it&nbsp;&nbsp; usually take to overturn something like that to&nbsp; where it can be instituted on a national level or&nbsp;&nbsp; a local level as the new law, the new um the new&nbsp; declaration? Uh how does that work? Like do you&nbsp;&nbsp; do you know like a percentage of the population&nbsp; that has to get on board with that or what it&nbsp;&nbsp; takes to overturn something like that? Well, it's&nbsp; funny because states have different precedents for&nbsp;&nbsp; that and like in America it's you know there state&nbsp; governments are almost autonomous. I mean like you&nbsp;&nbsp; look at a state like Vermont and its laws and then&nbsp; compare it to South Carolina and it's like whoa&nbsp;&nbsp; different countries right? Um but they they have&nbsp; a tradition. I know I'll give you an example in&nbsp;&nbsp; Pennsylvania um and I I worked with a group there&nbsp; who enacted this. It was beautiful to watch. In&nbsp;&nbsp; Pennsylvania it says uh people have the right to&nbsp; uh devolve power back to their community. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp; called having a home rule charter. And you don't&nbsp; need a percentage of the people. You just need u&nbsp;&nbsp; Americans in a community to write up this charter.&nbsp; And you can pass your own laws which are more&nbsp;&nbsp; valid than the state law. And the example in in in&nbsp; case the case in point was um about 10 years ago&nbsp;&nbsp; now in Pennsylvania in um in a county in central&nbsp; Pennsylvania um Adams County I believe they u&nbsp;&nbsp; the Pennsylvania General Energy was going to take&nbsp; frack water. Now you know fracking it's u polluted&nbsp;&nbsp; water right and they were going to dump it on&nbsp; the land and about 700 people live there and this&nbsp;&nbsp; woman and her daughter uh they're amazing people&nbsp; they got together and they started going around&nbsp;&nbsp; door to door and saying everybody Republican and&nbsp; Democrat and people who never voted they said look&nbsp;&nbsp; we got to unite here and stop this so they they&nbsp; headed assembly they passed the home rule charter&nbsp;&nbsp; and their first law was they abolished all dumping&nbsp; of wastewater land uh fracking on their land. They&nbsp;&nbsp; had a long legal battle for it and um eventually&nbsp; they won. It took them a long time, but they just&nbsp;&nbsp; stuck to their guns and they just cited the P&nbsp; Pennsylvania State Constitution. So this is the&nbsp;&nbsp; beauty of America. It's already there. Like in&nbsp; in Canada and England, well Canada especially,&nbsp;&nbsp; we've never had self-governance. We've never had&nbsp; it. So we do have to challenge the system head on.&nbsp;&nbsp; In America, you just have to take it back. You&nbsp; just have to reclaim it. What's already there,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's already there in the hearts and minds of&nbsp; people. And it's also there in your own laws.&nbsp;&nbsp; But a lot of those laws are being nullified now&nbsp; with this corporate system we've got. Like I've&nbsp;&nbsp; told you the examples of these guys in Texas&nbsp; who set up a common law group and they all got&nbsp;&nbsp; targeted and some of them are doing like a hundred&nbsp; years in jail, right, for not appearing in court.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just um my friend in in Chicago, he went&nbsp; into the Catholic church and handed the priest&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of my book and said, \"Are you aware of&nbsp; this policy of criminal where Catholic priests&nbsp;&nbsp; have to and any Catholic has to cover up child&nbsp; abuse?\" The priest calls the police. The police&nbsp;&nbsp; come and arrest my friend for talking to a priest&nbsp; and they hand him a ticket and said, \"You're up to&nbsp;&nbsp; appear in court.\" He walks into a room. It's not a&nbsp; court. with a camera staring at him and the voice&nbsp;&nbsp; out of the camera says, \"How do you plead?\" And&nbsp; he said, \"For what? You're not a court. You're a&nbsp;&nbsp; camera.\" He said, \"You have to plead or you'll go&nbsp; to jail.\" Said, \"This is not due process. It's not&nbsp;&nbsp; a court.\" And he pled not guilty and they put him&nbsp; in jail anyway. Like, does that sound like the law&nbsp;&nbsp; to you? Does that sound like due process? That's&nbsp; what goes on all the time. And especially with&nbsp;&nbsp; the fervor now over immigration and the ICE has a&nbsp; bigger budget than any other federal agency now.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's huge. And it's all about stripping people&nbsp; of their inherent liberties and locking them away&nbsp;&nbsp; for the private prison industry, right? And the&nbsp; for-profit prisons, if you look at a map of them,&nbsp;&nbsp; like a big company like Geo, which is one of the&nbsp; biggest for-profit prisons all over the South,&nbsp;&nbsp; all over Texas and the southern states, and&nbsp; they make money by getting judges on their&nbsp;&nbsp; payroll to criminalize misdemeanors like failure&nbsp; to repair in court. 20 years bang because you're&nbsp;&nbsp; making lots of money for GEO that way and uh&nbsp; the attorney general in Washington Pondi is&nbsp;&nbsp; a former lobbyist for the private prisons till&nbsp; 2019 and she's the attorney general helping them&nbsp;&nbsp; by saying okay hit people hard with sentences&nbsp; so that we can profit and that's so in a way in&nbsp;&nbsp; theory it's all there in America what we need&nbsp; but at the same time there's this other entity&nbsp;&nbsp; that's come in which has almost turned everything&nbsp; the clock right back. So in a practical sense,&nbsp;&nbsp; Americans do have to have another revolution&nbsp; literally. And the more people you have in it,&nbsp;&nbsp; the less violent it is, right? You get go to the&nbsp; police, you say stop, you know, stop serving this&nbsp;&nbsp; this corporate power and get back to what you&nbsp; know the republic supposed to be. But that can&nbsp;&nbsp; only happen if you've got something to present to&nbsp; them as an alternative. And that's why like the&nbsp;&nbsp; um one of the guys John Bradley who's uh chairing&nbsp; one of these con they call them constitutional&nbsp;&nbsp; conventions they set up a constitutional assembly&nbsp; that reestablishes the republic in their community&nbsp;&nbsp; and they say this is the republic now because you&nbsp; can't find in Washington you can't find in the&nbsp;&nbsp; courts um and you know they in the FBI and RCMP&nbsp; training manual says now and I've seen a copy of&nbsp;&nbsp; this anyone who uses the word sovereignty is a&nbsp; potential domestic terrorist. What? Well, that&nbsp;&nbsp; would include Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, all&nbsp; the founding fathers are now domestic terrorists.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, they've hyped up the police to think, oh, you&nbsp; talk sovereignty, you talk the Bill of Rights,&nbsp;&nbsp; and you're a terrorist. It's like it's this&nbsp; counterrevolution that's happened and we have&nbsp;&nbsp; to get back to who we are. And that's kind&nbsp; of the reality of what we're in right now,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Absolutely. Yes. And so in working with&nbsp; people to establish sovereignty in all these&nbsp;&nbsp; different levels and especially for example these&nbsp; groups that that you're currently working with,&nbsp;&nbsp; um I'd like for you to talk a little bit&nbsp; maybe about some obstacles, some roadblocks,&nbsp;&nbsp; some things to expect along the way and sort of&nbsp; how you help groups and how you've done yourself,&nbsp;&nbsp; how you've navigated those different things. cuz&nbsp; obviously this all sounds so great and we need to&nbsp;&nbsp; empower people to to go through that and to be&nbsp; able to get through it whenever there's those&nbsp;&nbsp; different things that might try to deter them.&nbsp; It's not easy. It's you got to be honest with&nbsp;&nbsp; people right up front. Say we're not promising you&nbsp; anything. There's no quick fix for this because&nbsp;&nbsp; it's taken years and years for this thing to come&nbsp; into place, this corporate dictatorship we're in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right? And so it's a lifelong commitment and it's&nbsp; something you have to teach your children because&nbsp;&nbsp; they're going to be involved in this. It's not&nbsp; going to happen overnight, but there's ways that&nbsp;&nbsp; we've learned that you can act now to increase&nbsp; the odds on more in our favor. Um, first of all,&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't go public right away and you don't&nbsp; invite all these people into an assembly because&nbsp;&nbsp; it falls apart quickly because there's no common&nbsp; ground. there's different levels of understanding&nbsp;&nbsp; and commitment and it it becomes crazy that people&nbsp; are it's like trying to hurt cats. You're just&nbsp;&nbsp; there's no common ground. So what you do is you&nbsp; find a few people who are aware who've known each&nbsp;&nbsp; other because you can't do this work without trust&nbsp; and knowing each other and you form a little cell&nbsp;&nbsp; group of three or four people and you start doing&nbsp; things in small ways um and probing and finding&nbsp;&nbsp; out local sympathetic police and and doing the&nbsp; education process and eventually you get you each&nbsp;&nbsp; of let's say you have a cell of three people. Each&nbsp; one of those three goes out and recruits three&nbsp;&nbsp; other people and you you go through a training&nbsp; education process and then after a while there's&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 of you and so you can then sign a charter and&nbsp; form a local republic assembly. That way you know&nbsp;&nbsp; each other and if the boot comes down you split&nbsp; off into the cell groups again, right? And it's&nbsp;&nbsp; more secure. It's like what you do in a in a&nbsp; police state. you have and when you read tales&nbsp;&nbsp; from like resistance movements like the French&nbsp; resistance and I've talked to people who were in&nbsp;&nbsp; it during World War II when I was younger and they&nbsp; all operated that way. They had to have the cell&nbsp;&nbsp; groups because they couldn't be infiltrated as&nbsp; easily. You know, if you have a big organization,&nbsp;&nbsp; it'll get taken out and I've been through that a&nbsp; lot. I know like all the signs. So, start small&nbsp;&nbsp; but realize that in your in your smallness is&nbsp; your strength and you can keep control over it,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? It isn't some organization run by experts,&nbsp; you know, and you see that a lot on the internet,&nbsp;&nbsp; like I'm the expert. Follow this blueprint&nbsp; and you've you'll be free. But they're just&nbsp;&nbsp; talking to individuals. They don't have a sense of&nbsp; okay, but how do we does that work for the whole&nbsp;&nbsp; community? Right? So that's kind of like basic&nbsp; common sense, but the thing that's lacking is&nbsp;&nbsp; the the determination, the will to carry on all&nbsp; the time. And it's exciting when your when your&nbsp;&nbsp; life finds that purpose. You know, the kind&nbsp; of the personal things we deal with in a day,&nbsp;&nbsp; they suddenly lose their importance. Um I my dad&nbsp; had a a story from the Korean War where he said,&nbsp;&nbsp; um there was this medic in their unit and they&nbsp; were under fire and he would always be running&nbsp;&nbsp; around tending people and people were saying, you&nbsp; know, look at this guy. He's right out there on&nbsp;&nbsp; the front lines. He has no fear. And he got hit&nbsp; by shrapnel. Boom, boom, boom. and he's running&nbsp;&nbsp; around bleeding from the shrapnel and somebody&nbsp; says, \"Do you need help?\" He says,\"I don't have&nbsp;&nbsp; time for shrapnel. I'm too busy here.\" Right? And&nbsp; I always remember that quote like, \"I don't have&nbsp;&nbsp; time for this.\" Like, \"Okay, so I'm hit with&nbsp; shrapnel. Doesn't matter. These guys are dying&nbsp;&nbsp; over here.\" Okay? And that's what the difference&nbsp; between commitment and u just uh being observer,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Because when you learn under fire is the&nbsp; only way to learn that what happens to you. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; it matters. But it's not as important as if you're&nbsp; just sitting there in a room by yourself where&nbsp;&nbsp; you become so totally self-obsessed and and&nbsp; the culture feeds into that, right? You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; um all the time they try to get you just kept&nbsp; in your little mental bubble and not connect&nbsp;&nbsp; with other people. So once you get out there&nbsp; and start doing things and I say to people,&nbsp;&nbsp; it doesn't even matter what you do, just do&nbsp; something. Like Napoleon said when he was asked,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"How do you plan a battle?\" He said, \"I never&nbsp; plan a battle. I start something and I see what&nbsp;&nbsp; happens.\" Because a battle of any kind is like&nbsp; life. It shifts all the time. It's constantly&nbsp;&nbsp; in motion and shifts and all your blueprints go&nbsp; out the window. You've got to always be observant&nbsp;&nbsp; on the ground what's going on and adapt and think&nbsp; in new strategies and tactics thinking creatively&nbsp;&nbsp; like that, right? So, it's a very exciting&nbsp; process because you have a sense after a&nbsp;&nbsp; while of waking up for the first time, right? Um&nbsp; people under fire say, \"I never felt more alive&nbsp;&nbsp; than when when we're getting shot at.\" Because&nbsp; life achieves like finally see the meaning of&nbsp;&nbsp; it. Every moment of life is so precious. You've&nbsp; got to use every moment and as opposed to kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of this nineto-five dead existence were raised to&nbsp; think that is life and it isn't. Right. So yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; that story really touches my heart. It's a&nbsp; really relatable way of sort of explaining&nbsp;&nbsp; how myself and I think everybody that you know&nbsp; every whistleblower, every survivor going forward,&nbsp;&nbsp; that's like a big question I'm sure you get and&nbsp; something that's come up on the show sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp; is you know pursuing action despite the obstacles&nbsp; that come in your path. And I think that really&nbsp;&nbsp; does come from elevating your your purpose to&nbsp; something bigger than you. You know, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp; we have a part in it and we have to take care&nbsp; of ourselves through it to make sure that we can&nbsp;&nbsp; sustain the endurance and the marathon. Like you&nbsp; said, change just doesn't happen right overnight&nbsp;&nbsp; because we get passionate about something. But I&nbsp; think it helps also really sort of deflect those&nbsp;&nbsp; bullets that that come towards us too because&nbsp; it's like how we see in your story. You've been&nbsp;&nbsp; defamed. You've had everything taken from you.&nbsp; You've had smear campaigns. I mean, the whole&nbsp;&nbsp; gambit has been thrown at you. you know, quarter&nbsp; million dollar smear campaigns against one man,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and so I'm sure you get asked all the&nbsp; time, you know, how did you keep going or why did&nbsp;&nbsp; you keep going? And I think when we understand&nbsp; the the consequence of not going forward,&nbsp;&nbsp; the cost of human life in the case of what&nbsp; we're talking about, you know, genocide,&nbsp;&nbsp; when you think about that, that that's still&nbsp; happening. This isn't just the past that you're&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about, even though you referenced the&nbsp; past because that was where your journey started,&nbsp;&nbsp; but this is still going on today. And so the cost&nbsp; of not moving forward is this continuing and it's&nbsp;&nbsp; still just being covered up. And so I feel like&nbsp; when we know something and when we know change&nbsp;&nbsp; needs to take place, there's an honor in carrying&nbsp; that because we get to carry that for the people&nbsp;&nbsp; that didn't make it out of those situations and&nbsp; that are still in it that wish that they could be&nbsp;&nbsp; in our shoes. You know, I try to think about these&nbsp; kids in these schools that you advocate for and,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, all the different types of survivors&nbsp; that you advocate for of all different, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; abuse types, but how any of those children would&nbsp; just give anything to be able to have a voice,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, especially as they grow into an adult&nbsp; if they survive these systems, you know? So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it really is like it becomes an honor to get to&nbsp; fight and the bullets don't you you almost sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of repel them naturally because it's like go ahead&nbsp; and attack me. Like, it's not about me. I'm doing&nbsp;&nbsp; this for other people. So, go ahead and attack&nbsp; me all you want, but I need to go, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; into this burning building and get these people&nbsp; out. You know, you can shoot at me all you want,&nbsp;&nbsp; but there's people being hurt right now that I&nbsp; need to attend to. Well, that thing about the&nbsp;&nbsp; burning building is really important. I'm glad you&nbsp; raised it because there's a a if you see a child&nbsp;&nbsp; in a burning building, you don't worry about&nbsp; the flames. There's this natural thing and you&nbsp;&nbsp; don't have to be the child's mother either. Anyone&nbsp; will boom, go in there and what is that? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's it's so inherent in us, right? And um that's&nbsp; why I say to people um for your own, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of well-being, you can never do anything by&nbsp; yourself because they love that. Then they go,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Oh, good. We're going to make an example of this&nbsp; person.\" Bang. Throw them away for 20 years. When&nbsp;&nbsp; people tell the horror stories, I always say,&nbsp; \"Yeah, but the person in a way brought it on&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves because they tried to do it on their&nbsp; own.\" You never just declare, \"I'm not paying&nbsp;&nbsp; taxes to Uncle Sam anymore.\" No, you form an&nbsp; assembly and pass a law and say, \"We're keeping&nbsp;&nbsp; federal tax on our community. and 50 people do&nbsp; that. It's harder to target target 50 than one.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we got to start thinking together, you know,&nbsp; not just how to do it, but doing it together at&nbsp;&nbsp; all times. You never like another tip, you never&nbsp; go in if you want to challenge somebody or you&nbsp;&nbsp; go into a court or whatever, you never go by&nbsp; yourself. You always have two or three witnesses&nbsp;&nbsp; and somebody with a camera so you have a record&nbsp; of everything. And so just learning to operate&nbsp;&nbsp; that way is a new way of thinking for people but&nbsp; it's it's essential otherwise you don't last long&nbsp;&nbsp; and you get used and you know I mean I've seen too&nbsp; many people who do that who don't learn the lesson&nbsp;&nbsp; and that's what these books are all about passing&nbsp; the on these truths right yes and so speaking of&nbsp;&nbsp; court obviously that is a big part of this is&nbsp; trying to get some type of of law established&nbsp;&nbsp; in our communities that becomes in official&nbsp; law and overwrites whatever wasn't working. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; how do we enforce these court orders? Like what's&nbsp; important to know about going to court? At what&nbsp;&nbsp; point would would a group want to do that and&nbsp; what do they need to prepare for that? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; we're talking about exactly that issue with&nbsp; this group in Texas that's been so targeted. And&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the first problem was they went into the&nbsp; existing courts and what's set up now. They're&nbsp;&nbsp; not courts of law operating according to due&nbsp; process. They're more like military courts,&nbsp;&nbsp; administrative tribunals, where there's no due&nbsp; process. You're not assumed to be innocent. Uh&nbsp;&nbsp; you're assumed to be guilty and it's up to you.&nbsp; Like like in a a heresy trial in the Middle Ages&nbsp;&nbsp; or what I went through. You have to go along and&nbsp; agree with the system and help destroy yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, you get, you know, you're you're&nbsp; somehow looking guilty for not doing that. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't go into the existing what are called&nbsp; courts at all. And if they try to come for you,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's ways you can defend yourself. It always&nbsp; involves other people. It declans going to the&nbsp;&nbsp; police locally and saying, you know, that I don't&nbsp; recognize that jurisdiction of that court over&nbsp;&nbsp; me. And in fact, there's things like habius&nbsp; corpus and mandamus rits that you can you can&nbsp;&nbsp; uh file in local court registry and it says&nbsp; I'm transferring if you're being targeted. If&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a case against you, you say, \"Okay, but&nbsp; I'm transferring the jurisdiction from this false&nbsp;&nbsp; court that has no authority over me into our own&nbsp; common law court, which we've established here,&nbsp;&nbsp; which does have jurisdiction because it's based on&nbsp; universal common law.\" And uh and so we, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we've helped people do that, but you need a&nbsp; team around you to do that. And that's why I&nbsp;&nbsp; say don't ever try it on your own. Don't go into&nbsp; their jurisdiction. contact us and we can help&nbsp;&nbsp; bring that's what I do 90% of the time now with&nbsp; people just bringing that support and knowledge&nbsp;&nbsp; to bear so that you don't walk in and put the&nbsp; noose around your own neck which often happens&nbsp;&nbsp; um enforcement the power of enforcement in common&nbsp; courts is tremendous because everyone is empowered&nbsp;&nbsp; to enforce the verdict right in a common and&nbsp; that's why Ringer after we convicted him he&nbsp;&nbsp; hid out in the Vatican till the day he died&nbsp; because he knew anyone can enforce that vertic&nbsp;&nbsp; against him to arrest the guy. Um you know so&nbsp; any citizen is obligated to be deputized by&nbsp;&nbsp; a sheriff Kamla sheriff and in in effect made&nbsp; into a posy. Uh now that's got western movies&nbsp;&nbsp; and that have made it seem like a posi is like a&nbsp; lynch mob. It isn't. It comes from a Latin term&nbsp;&nbsp; from the English Shy communities in the Middle&nbsp; Ages. And every able-bodied man was expected to&nbsp;&nbsp; help defend the community. So somebody was found&nbsp; guilty of of murder or for example, everyone the&nbsp;&nbsp; posi were deputized local sheriffs who would then&nbsp; go and arrest the person to make sure they didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; harm anyone. Everyone has a obligation to do&nbsp; that. So you know this verdict, I say to people,&nbsp;&nbsp; we're holding this gun in our hand. We don't&nbsp; even realize the power of what we've done. Every&nbsp;&nbsp; Catholic priest in the world is part of a criminal&nbsp; conspiracy to protect child rapists. That means&nbsp;&nbsp; you have the right to go and not just arrest&nbsp; them as individuals but seize, you know, their&nbsp;&nbsp; buildings and assets, you know, and they have and&nbsp; they know that. You see, they're not stupid. They&nbsp;&nbsp; know people have that power now, but they rely&nbsp; on people's fear and ignorance, you know, to to&nbsp;&nbsp; not to prevent that enforcement of that. But we&nbsp; could reclaim the whole world tomorrow if people&nbsp;&nbsp; knew that because we own the world inherently.&nbsp; All of us, you know, according to natural law,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Especially when the people in power&nbsp; so-called power are convicted criminals. Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly. And that's a hard realization, but you&nbsp; know, it it really is empowering to learn how our&nbsp;&nbsp; world works and then to realize that, hey, we've&nbsp; been letting all these people just rule over us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We've just been sitting back watching. It's time&nbsp; for us. like we can actually be the leaders of our&nbsp;&nbsp; world and take matters into our own hands. And&nbsp; so kind of speaking of that, so you established&nbsp;&nbsp; the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church&nbsp; and State. You mentioned a couple of these other&nbsp;&nbsp; groups have established a group that has a name.&nbsp; Um what would you recommend if people do want to&nbsp;&nbsp; have a group? Is it important to have sort of an&nbsp; established organizational name? Do they need to&nbsp;&nbsp; incorporate? Um what's kind of a step to do um&nbsp; that's the most effective in your opinion? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; not incorporate because that's the system. You&nbsp; know that corpus means corpse dead. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're you becoming a dead thing. Uh we don't&nbsp; do any of that. We um it's good to have a name&nbsp;&nbsp; and identity. You know that you know we belong&nbsp; to this now, right? We don't belong to the old&nbsp;&nbsp; system. That's why citizenship cards, a flag, um&nbsp; you know, a name for ourselves is very important.&nbsp;&nbsp; So um that yeah that's absolutely part of this&nbsp; whole process right thing to understand as well&nbsp;&nbsp; is that um allegiances are something drilled into&nbsp; somebody's head from birth and it's very hard to&nbsp;&nbsp; get people to switch an allegiance. So we don't&nbsp; language is very important. We don't use the word&nbsp;&nbsp; allegiance. Um it's slave master slave language&nbsp; like please and thank you. these terms we're all&nbsp;&nbsp; tra you know it's like subordinate um to plea in&nbsp; court to make a plea it's like you're pleading&nbsp;&nbsp; to the slave master right like these are terms&nbsp; all designed to program you to like the word&nbsp;&nbsp; arrogant taught that's bad to be arrogant um it&nbsp; the Italian word it comes from arrogati means to&nbsp;&nbsp; claim for yourself okay so why is that a bad thing&nbsp; it isn't but your brain wants to think when you're&nbsp;&nbsp; outget you're being bad Right? And and so you see&nbsp; the way we're all drilled to be functional slaves,&nbsp;&nbsp; even though don't they don't call it that,&nbsp; right? So when you start breaking out of that,&nbsp;&nbsp; um you can't it's too much of a mental shock&nbsp; to tell people we're ending this and beginning&nbsp;&nbsp; this. You say, \"No, we're reclaiming we're&nbsp; reclaiming something that was always ours,&nbsp;&nbsp; but we've been kept in the dark. We're being kept&nbsp; asleep about all this stuff. Now awaken to this&nbsp;&nbsp; and just reclaim it.\" Because once you reclaim&nbsp; it, enough people do that, their whole system goes&nbsp;&nbsp; into the toilet because it's parasitic. It's&nbsp; a form of energy vampireism. It feeds off our&nbsp;&nbsp; attention. That's why I say to people, turn off&nbsp; the internet, folks. Those people don't matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, look in the mirror, look at each other.&nbsp; That's that's how you get your power back. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp; you for sharing that. That's really interesting.&nbsp; I actually didn't know that even though I've I've&nbsp;&nbsp; thought about how strange it is that confidence&nbsp; is looked at you know they don't it's it's rarely&nbsp;&nbsp; heard that that that word arrogant and confidence&nbsp; sort of goes hand in hand but it's always denoted&nbsp;&nbsp; as this negative thing you know arrogance&nbsp; arrogance ego arrogance when I think when&nbsp;&nbsp; people don't have that then like you said they're&nbsp; very submissive and they give their power away to&nbsp;&nbsp; ar to actual arrogance people in the definition&nbsp; that society thinks that it is. Somebody is going&nbsp;&nbsp; to have power over us if it's not us. You&nbsp; know, if we don't take our own power back,&nbsp;&nbsp; then we're going to give it to somebody else to&nbsp; rule us, you know, for us. And so, I think that&nbsp;&nbsp; that's a really important distinction and it's&nbsp; really actually interesting how how, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we've sort of forgotten the roots of some of these&nbsp; words, even genocide, like how we talked about&nbsp;&nbsp; the first time that that we chatted. Well, it's&nbsp; funny. I actually start the book in the intro here&nbsp;&nbsp; uh with best examples are from her own family. And&nbsp; so when my daughter Elellanar was really little,&nbsp;&nbsp; she had two favorite expressions. She always&nbsp; said, \"You're not the boss of me.\" To everybody.&nbsp;&nbsp; She would say that to everybody and her teachers&nbsp; in school. You're not the boss of me. Which is&nbsp;&nbsp; true. Nobody's our boss. She also said, \"But why?&nbsp; Why, Daddy? Why? Why?\" She was always asking why.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had to know for herself because she knew&nbsp; that Elellanar was governing herself. She said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I govern myself.\" Right now, you know, that's&nbsp; so common sense and it's every child knows that&nbsp;&nbsp; and that's why everything's designed to&nbsp; batter that out of them, that awareness,&nbsp;&nbsp; make them afraid of themselves, right?&nbsp; That way. But I always think that yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; the examples are so close to home. We just&nbsp; have to see it in our own family, our own life,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Yeah. We forget to that we have the power&nbsp; to ask why. and that we deserve an answer if&nbsp;&nbsp; there's going to be a law or somebody trying to&nbsp; govern over us or tell us what to do instead of&nbsp;&nbsp; just accepting it. You know, we'll complain about&nbsp; stuff without addressing that and saying, \"Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; why?\" You know, can we learn the reasons and make&nbsp; sure that this is a good outcome at the end first&nbsp;&nbsp; before this is just thrown on us as being the law&nbsp; or a rule or something that we have to abide by.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. And and kind of a PS on that story, Ellaner&nbsp; is now studying law. No way. America. Proud dad.&nbsp;&nbsp; She Oh, I'm very proud of her. She's like me.&nbsp; She's like me. It's like human rights law, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; women in the law and and that kind of thing. So,&nbsp; she's a humanitarian like you. Well, she's Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; it carries on. I mean, and that's a metaphor&nbsp; for all of us like we are obligated to the next&nbsp;&nbsp; generation to pass this on, right? So absolutely&nbsp; on their shoulders. Yeah. And so in this quest&nbsp;&nbsp; going back to sort of the talking about getting&nbsp; people together, taking action in your experience,&nbsp;&nbsp; what have been some of the the big successes that&nbsp; you can share? And then also on the other end,&nbsp;&nbsp; what are some of the kind of pitfalls or failures&nbsp; that that you've gone through that that you've&nbsp;&nbsp; learned from and that we can learn from with you?&nbsp; Well, there have been so many victories, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and people expect huge immediate results from&nbsp; victory. I think it's part of the movie culture,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, when you see these things in television&nbsp; or movies. But, um, the victories are because it's&nbsp;&nbsp; all human. It's very, very personal and very&nbsp; up close. And, you know, when I saw people&nbsp;&nbsp; who couldn't even like the example of William&nbsp; Kums being in the church with us that day when&nbsp;&nbsp; the sound of a church bell would terrify him, make&nbsp; him vomit and there he is. He's like a new person.&nbsp;&nbsp; just the power of that. And when everyone saw him&nbsp; like that, we were in tears. We were embracing&nbsp;&nbsp; each other when we walked out of the church&nbsp; because we knew we had turned the tide there.&nbsp;&nbsp; And sure enough, that same month, the government&nbsp; started talking about apologies and missing&nbsp;&nbsp; children directly because we were occupying those&nbsp; churches. And the look in the eyes of those people&nbsp;&nbsp; and the sense we had among each other. These are&nbsp; mostly poor Aboriginal people who've been under&nbsp;&nbsp; the boot their whole life, okay, and traumatized&nbsp; and tortured from a young age. The hope in their&nbsp;&nbsp; eyes suddenly we caused that. Okay, we caused&nbsp; that. That was a victory that went boom. It it it&nbsp;&nbsp; just had it's still having a ripple effect, right?&nbsp; And you know when you tell people that they think&nbsp;&nbsp; well how could David have brought down Goliath&nbsp; like that like is that it doesn't sound possible&nbsp;&nbsp; but you got to experience once you experience it&nbsp; you know it's very possible it's more possible&nbsp;&nbsp; than people realize right that we've had a lot&nbsp; of things like that and um I mean another victory&nbsp;&nbsp; you there were 20,000 of us marching through the&nbsp; streets of London right when the pro when Pope&nbsp;&nbsp; Benedict came to London it was called the protest&nbsp; the pope march The organizers expected 500 people,&nbsp;&nbsp; 20,000 show up and we had the downtown part&nbsp; of London so shut down. Normally the London&nbsp;&nbsp; cops put in these barriers and guide people on&nbsp; we people were just pushing the barriers back.&nbsp;&nbsp; weren't afraid and the cops were kind of standing&nbsp; impotently over at the side not knowing what to&nbsp;&nbsp; do but there was 20,000 and we're passing Canada&nbsp; house which is the Canadian embassy right into&nbsp;&nbsp; Fogger Square and I thought oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is too&nbsp; good an opportunity to pass up so I pull out the&nbsp;&nbsp; bullhorn and I start saying to people I start&nbsp; talking about the Canadian genocide and these&nbsp;&nbsp; British people are really funny they're going&nbsp; oh no not Canada that couldn't have happened in&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada oh my god we didn't know anything about&nbsp; this and they start applauding and cheering&nbsp;&nbsp; And one funny thing that happened, I I hear&nbsp; a voice behind me. Oh, very well done. And&nbsp;&nbsp; I look around and there's Gandalf, you know, the&nbsp; actor who plays Gandalf uh in Lord of the Rings,&nbsp;&nbsp; uh Ian Mckllen. Okay, he's standing there. He's&nbsp; kind of he's like 6'4. He's kind of standing&nbsp;&nbsp; above me. He said, \"Well done. Well done.\" And&nbsp; um I said, \"Well, talk about this.\" And he said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"I certainly will.\" And then gave me a crushing&nbsp; handshake and uh carried on with his group. Right.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I thought like all of those things, it's just&nbsp; such beautiful memories and um you know, you've&nbsp;&nbsp; got them on the run at that point when people are&nbsp; that united and that happy. And I always say to&nbsp;&nbsp; people, I've gotten my my greatest joys in life&nbsp; when my daughters were born and I helped deliver&nbsp;&nbsp; them, but also um at those moments when people are&nbsp; united and they realize they can change the world,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? and and those are the the the heartfelt&nbsp; victories that they never steal from you. They&nbsp;&nbsp; always carry on those memories. Um the things&nbsp; that um the other side of the coin you said the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh mistakes or was it how did you put it? Yeah,&nbsp; I guess the kind of the pitfalls, the failures,&nbsp;&nbsp; the when you in a way when you uh you build up&nbsp; in your enthusiasm, you can say to people, okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; we're going to you can promise them things that&nbsp; you may not be able to deliver and that's not&nbsp;&nbsp; a good thing because when people get up their&nbsp; hopes and then it they crash, it's worse than&nbsp;&nbsp; if you never tried it. Yeah. And and it's set up&nbsp; that way. That's why they like the government and&nbsp;&nbsp; churches and others lead you down blind alleys,&nbsp; right? And say, \"Okay, well, just come to court&nbsp;&nbsp; and we'll give you compensation.\" And then they&nbsp; don't. That that whole thing about the residential&nbsp;&nbsp; school survivors, they led them on with the&nbsp; belief that they could get justice through the&nbsp;&nbsp; courts. And in fact, they get a gag order and very&nbsp; little money and people, you know, I knew people&nbsp;&nbsp; would kill themselves in despair after that. So,&nbsp; it's designed to do that, the opposite of what I&nbsp;&nbsp; just talked about, the victory. It's designed to&nbsp; discourage, make people despairing, and then lock&nbsp;&nbsp; back up in their little poles again, right, where&nbsp; they won't do anything. So, you got to be careful&nbsp;&nbsp; the way, never promise too much. Don't take people&nbsp; down blind alleys. Um, and yet be be bold in&nbsp;&nbsp; those moments that come along. And again quoting&nbsp; Napoleon in every battle there is one moment of&nbsp;&nbsp; decisive moment. The key the great art is to seize&nbsp; that moment. Okay? So when you're you're part of a&nbsp;&nbsp; movement you'll see opportunities come along and&nbsp; if you strike at that moment strategically at the&nbsp;&nbsp; right place like we did, you win, you know, and&nbsp; doesn't matter how big the bad guy is, you'll win.&nbsp;&nbsp; And and so that's misjudging the moment that can&nbsp; you you're going to learn to think strategically&nbsp;&nbsp; all the time, right? Yeah. 100%. And I'd love&nbsp; to hear a little bit about sort of you have been&nbsp;&nbsp; very successful both with educating yourself on&nbsp; this and then implementing it into actual action.&nbsp;&nbsp; And you've obviously with your own work, you've&nbsp; been helping seize the land and recover the church&nbsp;&nbsp; buildings, you know, from this sort of evil uh&nbsp; generational, I should say, multi-generational&nbsp;&nbsp; um system that has been inhabiting it. I'd&nbsp; love to hear a little bit about how you've&nbsp;&nbsp; been sort of deestablishing this genocide that&nbsp; is happening in the church and crowns, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; cuz I think it's really neat just to see kind of&nbsp; your work in action and so that way we can sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; wrap our minds around things that we can do with&nbsp; whatever the causes that we're fighting for. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, where the it's worked, it's always among&nbsp; uh groups of people who already know each other&nbsp;&nbsp; and are working together and it tends to happen in&nbsp; small towns. So, for example, like in a big city,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a big cathedral with people going in.&nbsp; It's kind of hard to imagine, well, how do you&nbsp;&nbsp; occupy that? And like unless you've got people&nbsp; who've already tried it, right? Where it's worked,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I've been there at these moments, native&nbsp; people just say, \"To hell with us. We're going&nbsp;&nbsp; in.\" And they go in and tell the priest to get&nbsp; out. And in Canada, the advantage is it's not&nbsp;&nbsp; politically very wise to start locking up a lot&nbsp; of native people for just asserting their their&nbsp;&nbsp; land right. And they have the right to seize those&nbsp; churches, the law of reparation. The church has&nbsp;&nbsp; done so much damage to their people that they&nbsp; have every right to take that as reparations&nbsp;&nbsp; because they never got any financial compensation&nbsp; of any kind. And they've been the churches built&nbsp;&nbsp; on their land without asking permission. So that's&nbsp; Chief Kapalano when we occupied the churches in&nbsp;&nbsp; Vancouver. He had filed a a thing in Supreme Court&nbsp; of British Columbia saying they're I'm ordering&nbsp;&nbsp; them off our land at that point. And he made me&nbsp; his legal agent so I can enforce that. That's why&nbsp;&nbsp; the police never stopped our church occupations.&nbsp; I showed them the court order and I said, \"We have&nbsp;&nbsp; every right to do this. They're the criminals.&nbsp; They have a policy to protect child rapists. Help&nbsp;&nbsp; us arrest them.\" And at that point, the police&nbsp; always leave. You know, they don't intervene. They&nbsp;&nbsp; don't help. but they don't hang around. So, you've&nbsp; got a great lever in those situations. And I've&nbsp;&nbsp; seen like there was one uh up north in northern&nbsp; BC where a group of grandmothers went in and&nbsp;&nbsp; during a Catholic mass and they just went into the&nbsp; pulpit and they ordered everybody out. They said,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"This is our land. You use this church to kill&nbsp; our people now. Get out.\" Just told them to&nbsp;&nbsp; get out and they took it over. The Mounties were&nbsp; outside with a little cruiser and the light going,&nbsp;&nbsp; but they never did anything. Right. It's funny.&nbsp; The Mounties would come to me as the only white&nbsp;&nbsp; guy and ask me and I said, \"I'm not in charge. Go&nbsp; talk to the grandmothers.\" And they didn't want to&nbsp;&nbsp; do that, right? I said, \"You want to arrest some&nbsp; grandmothers? Like, we'll film this. You guys will&nbsp;&nbsp; be on the evening news. Come on, go ahead.\" So,&nbsp; you gota you have we have so much power. It's just&nbsp;&nbsp; the frustrating thing is people aren't trained&nbsp; to how to exercise it and and we tend to want to&nbsp;&nbsp; follow an example and you know and that's why you&nbsp; do have to lead by example but we just got to get&nbsp;&nbsp; those stories and those and film those incidents&nbsp; and get them out. We did have that posted but&nbsp;&nbsp; again taken out swabbed out very quickly like the&nbsp; time in Liverpool England where this was about 15&nbsp;&nbsp; years ago now there was a judge imposing illegal&nbsp; county taxes. So the local common law group, some&nbsp;&nbsp; of these people are now involved in organizing&nbsp; the republic um their Liverpool branch, but uh&nbsp;&nbsp; the Republic of Albon in England, but they got&nbsp; about 300 guys together, women, I say God, men and&nbsp;&nbsp; women. Um and they went into the court and they&nbsp; physically took the judge out of the seat, disroed&nbsp;&nbsp; him and put somebody else in and they nullified&nbsp; the county tax and fired him. And the judge were&nbsp;&nbsp; last seen kind of scurrying out of the courtroom.&nbsp; And it's funny because in the American Revolution&nbsp;&nbsp; before the first shots were fired at Concord in&nbsp; Lexington. That's exactly what they did. Like the&nbsp;&nbsp; Green Mountain Boys in Vermont, they would go&nbsp; into Crown Courts, burn up the mortgage deeds&nbsp;&nbsp; because the crownbacked New York finance series&nbsp; were just buying up everybody's land and evicting&nbsp;&nbsp; the farmers. They go in, they threw the court.&nbsp; Uh, and there's a cartoon of a crown judge running&nbsp;&nbsp; down to the ship to get on the boat to go back to&nbsp; England because the Green Mountain Boys had taken&nbsp;&nbsp; over the court and burned all the mortgage deeds.&nbsp; That's the first shots that were fired, right? And&nbsp;&nbsp; um, they knew strike where the problem was. And&nbsp; that's the same thing like 250 years later doing&nbsp;&nbsp; the same thing. You know, you're that's why in&nbsp; in Chile a few years ago, the Mapuchi Indians&nbsp;&nbsp; burned like 25 Catholic churches to the ground&nbsp; because they were seizing the local native land.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were trafficking the children out of the&nbsp; churches. So, the Mapuche said, \"Screw you. Your&nbsp;&nbsp; churches are gone.\" And Burggalio, Pope Francis,&nbsp; was besieged in the papal palace in San Diego. He&nbsp;&nbsp; couldn't get out. There's a crowd of 2,000 angry&nbsp; papuches outside besieging the pope in the palace.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's like, but again, how often do you hear these&nbsp; stories? You only hear it from the people who did&nbsp;&nbsp; it, right? So that's why I I really cherish&nbsp; your u broadcasts because we're getting these&nbsp;&nbsp; real stories out to people, you know. Yeah. And&nbsp; and on my channel, there's been so many different&nbsp;&nbsp; establishments that have been whistleblown to&nbsp; be corrupt from universities to Freemason lodges&nbsp;&nbsp; to churches to schools. Um, you know, there's no&nbsp; shortage of establishments in our own community,&nbsp;&nbsp; courts included, police stations, police officers.&nbsp; You know, there's so much corruption that's right&nbsp;&nbsp; around us in our community. And and I love that&nbsp; reminder that we can do things peacefully without&nbsp;&nbsp; violence, making a point by getting people&nbsp; together that approach things a certain way.&nbsp;&nbsp; And just because maybe, you know, it doesn't seem&nbsp; polite to like go right in and sort of protest&nbsp;&nbsp; against something that we overcome that and be&nbsp; like, well, is it polite what they're doing to&nbsp;&nbsp; kids or is it polite what they're doing? Like,&nbsp; we need to go in and make a difference and bring&nbsp;&nbsp; awareness to this and to also take our power back&nbsp; from worrying about, you know, the nuance of what&nbsp;&nbsp; will people think of me if I take a stand against&nbsp; this in my own community. That's right. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and uh you never worry about what's official&nbsp; anyway because corruption exists because of&nbsp;&nbsp; apathy. We help curb the corruption by doing&nbsp; nothing about it. So don't point your not you but&nbsp;&nbsp; anyone who points corruption points at corruption&nbsp; say well why aren't you doing something about it&nbsp;&nbsp; right? It's not it's not just a matter of like&nbsp; the system rests on corruption. The system of&nbsp;&nbsp; greed and self-interest requires corruption.&nbsp; Right? So we morally replace that and bring&nbsp;&nbsp; in people's power governing themselves. You won't&nbsp; have corruption, you know, because you're telling&nbsp;&nbsp; people to go to the high ground and out of act&nbsp; out of your virtue and not your self-interest,&nbsp;&nbsp; greed. And we don't have to adapt to this filth&nbsp; anymore around us. And uh we teach that. I hope&nbsp;&nbsp; that for example this interview we're doing be&nbsp; great to show it to children in school. Show it&nbsp;&nbsp; to high school students. Say start thinking about&nbsp; these things. It's in your hands. I'll be dead in&nbsp;&nbsp; however many number of years. It's up to you guys,&nbsp; men and women. And so, speaking of time, more&nbsp;&nbsp; generations to come. You've been whistleblowing&nbsp; for decades and and working at this and getting&nbsp;&nbsp; other groups to help and and it's been a very slow&nbsp; process, I'm sure, of educating and then getting&nbsp;&nbsp; people off their, you know, off their butts to&nbsp; go take action and especially in groups. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; talk about what's at stake. What is the time that&nbsp; we have left? you know, do we still have decades&nbsp;&nbsp; and generations or what have you seen in your time&nbsp; and how time is accelerating and how we're keeping&nbsp;&nbsp; up with it? You know, I think with the technology&nbsp; at play and what's going on in the world and&nbsp;&nbsp; clearly a move to create these corporate spheres,&nbsp; uh, run, you know, running the world, um, the&nbsp;&nbsp; whole plan to, um, really turn the human race into&nbsp; functional robots, cybernetic organisms through&nbsp;&nbsp; the technology, it's happening exponentially&nbsp; quicker all the time. And I don't know in 10 years&nbsp;&nbsp; or 5 years it may be so locked in that there is no&nbsp; way to fight it. And I think we people have to see&nbsp;&nbsp; the urgency of this. It's something right on our&nbsp; doorstep happening right now. Because it hasn't&nbsp;&nbsp; hit you doesn't mean it's not happening right and&nbsp; you'll see it hit you when when the knock comes in&nbsp;&nbsp; your door and then it'll be too late. So I would&nbsp; say to people this has to be the priority of your&nbsp;&nbsp; life and if not what life will we have right so&nbsp; that urgency I also see lacking in people you know&nbsp;&nbsp; um it's a matter of life and death now right yes&nbsp; and I appreciate you sharing that too because I&nbsp;&nbsp; think that's we always think we have more time&nbsp; you know but we don't realize how every day that&nbsp;&nbsp; goes by every year they're able to advance what&nbsp; they're doing exponentially because they have&nbsp;&nbsp; more resources and more power. They have more&nbsp; sort of permission, less people standing up,&nbsp;&nbsp; more technology, you know. So I my hope always is&nbsp; that people feel that urgency along with us and&nbsp;&nbsp; again feel compelled to get up and do something&nbsp; about it. Go ahead. They are they are because&nbsp;&nbsp; like we started talking about the new movements in&nbsp; England and America. Talking to those people, they&nbsp;&nbsp; say the same thing I see all the time. There's a&nbsp; huge ground swell of opposition everywhere now.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it's like when you study revolutions in the&nbsp; past, every time like a month before the outbreak&nbsp;&nbsp; happens, people are all saying the same thing.&nbsp; It's not going to happen in our lifetime. People&nbsp;&nbsp; are too apathetic. There's not doing anything.&nbsp; Next thing you know, bang, the Bastile has fallen,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? And I mean, things always work that&nbsp; way. It's it's it's like an iceberg. Most of&nbsp;&nbsp; it you don't see. It's under underground under the&nbsp; water. But boom, one day, you know, it'll surface&nbsp;&nbsp; and sooner than later. And so that's why this&nbsp; knowledge is essential and why we need to organize&nbsp;&nbsp; have the steam and the piston both operating now&nbsp; to get our movement going. Right. Yes. Exactly.&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more question that I had for you and then&nbsp; if there's anything else that you want to cover,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll give you some. This is good. Yeah. Um I think&nbsp; I always love again learning lessons from you. And&nbsp;&nbsp; of course there's the action that we talked about&nbsp; about sitting idally, knowing something's wrong,&nbsp;&nbsp; and then actually getting up and and trying to&nbsp; expose it or do something about it. But you've&nbsp;&nbsp; gone an extra step to where you're trying to not&nbsp; just expose it but stop it. Can you talk about&nbsp;&nbsp; that transition for you and sort of your mindset&nbsp; in those two different things? Because exposing&nbsp;&nbsp; and stopping are very different. And I think&nbsp; that's where we need to move as as a society&nbsp;&nbsp; is stopping, right? And stopping means create&nbsp; alternative. And we can talk about that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; in the abstract, but it's only in your life&nbsp; experience that you you learn these things. And I&nbsp;&nbsp; made that mistake early on. I thought it was just&nbsp; a matter of educating people. You know, I think&nbsp;&nbsp; the Quakers have the saying, speak truth to power&nbsp; as if doing that is going to get the power to go,&nbsp;&nbsp; \"Oh my god, we're wrong. You mean we're hurting&nbsp; people?\" It assumes a moral capacity on the rulers&nbsp;&nbsp; that doesn't exist because a corporation has no&nbsp; morality. It's just about its own survival. And&nbsp;&nbsp; you advance high up in the hierarchy by being&nbsp; like that, by being a functional psychopath.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can't appeal to the morals. And we talk&nbsp; about that in our handbooks. You don't rely on&nbsp;&nbsp; the system at all. Right? Um I had to learn that&nbsp; the hard way. Uh and I only learned it because&nbsp;&nbsp; everything in my life was ripped apart and I had&nbsp; to create something new. And I think the best&nbsp;&nbsp; fighters are the people who are like that. Like&nbsp; the native people who occupied those churches with&nbsp;&nbsp; me and a few others. They didn't have any life&nbsp; left over. They could take the risk, right? And&nbsp;&nbsp; realize that they had to do it. Um what did they&nbsp; have to lose, right? And I think we'll eventually&nbsp;&nbsp; get to that point. enough of us are getting to&nbsp; that point where our backs are to the wall and&nbsp;&nbsp; like Sunsu says in the art of war, never push an&nbsp; enemy into a corner because then they really come&nbsp;&nbsp; on fighting because I know they're going to die.&nbsp; So, and I think we got to have our sense of our&nbsp;&nbsp; own mortality in this. I think that's why I'm more&nbsp; impassionate all the time because I can see the&nbsp;&nbsp; end of my life closer than the beginning, right?&nbsp; And I realize, okay, every moment has to count in&nbsp;&nbsp; this and we're all going to die. The question&nbsp; is on what terms and what are you going to&nbsp;&nbsp; leave behind, right? Not this idea that we're not&nbsp; going to, right? There's a we all have an expiry&nbsp;&nbsp; date and what are you going to do between now and&nbsp; then? It's going to be in our mind all the time,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Absolutely. you know, and and sort of from&nbsp; my own perspective this week, you brought up Pam&nbsp;&nbsp; Bondi here in the United States and we're sort&nbsp; of facing a crisis as a nation and you're seeing&nbsp;&nbsp; it before it's happening in a group of people&nbsp; who are just saying screw politics like why are&nbsp;&nbsp; we participating in this, you know, but but we&nbsp; are seeing more and more people that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; they're having faith in these saviors that are&nbsp; that they're they think that they're electing into&nbsp;&nbsp; office to create change and then they're being let&nbsp; down and starting to question everything. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; if they lied about this, if they're not, for&nbsp; example, going to release the Epstein list,&nbsp;&nbsp; what else were they lying about? Was the&nbsp; assassination attempt a lie? Was this a&nbsp;&nbsp; lie? Were the other promises that they made a lie?&nbsp; You know, so it is really neat to see sort of that&nbsp;&nbsp; critical thought process starting to infuse itself&nbsp; back into society. But it's just like you said,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I think that you're just such a great example&nbsp; of of words are great, but what action are you&nbsp;&nbsp; taking and what are you actively trying to do to&nbsp; not just educate because people don't know always&nbsp;&nbsp; what to do with education. You know, we've been&nbsp; educating on things for a long time. There's no&nbsp;&nbsp; lack of people that believe and know on some level&nbsp; that corruption is happening. But taking action&nbsp;&nbsp; to actually stop it is different than exposing it.&nbsp; And that differentiation and what you've done with&nbsp;&nbsp; your path, I think, is heroic. Kevin, it makes an&nbsp; impact. It inspires people and it's so wonderful&nbsp;&nbsp; that people like you exist. You know, it gives me&nbsp; hope. It gives me a purpose to keep going knowing&nbsp;&nbsp; that there's people like you out there. And I know&nbsp; that it it inspires people that that hear you and&nbsp;&nbsp; feel relief of, oh my gosh, I can do this, too.&nbsp; But thank God there's people out there actually&nbsp;&nbsp; doing something because I felt so hopeless. You&nbsp; will become your own hero. You will help create&nbsp;&nbsp; many heroes because we all are. We all have the&nbsp; potential within us to do that. I mean, it's just&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just an ordinary guy, but I just didn't give&nbsp; up. And people said, \"Well, you're not ordinary,&nbsp;&nbsp; so fine, maybe I'm not.\" But that doesn't matter&nbsp; anymore than who sits in the White House matters,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Like that's the trouble with with the&nbsp; people or the problem. Everyone thinks about them&nbsp;&nbsp; too much. They don't they don't matter ultimately.&nbsp; Know yourself and act on the heroism that you feel&nbsp;&nbsp; and and you'll be a hero, too, and you'll inspire&nbsp; many others. So, I'm passing that torch on. That's&nbsp;&nbsp; where we're talking today, right? An ordinary man&nbsp; who has done extraordinary things. And so Kevin,&nbsp;&nbsp; tell us where we can connect with you. Let's maybe&nbsp; remind people of the book recommendations that we&nbsp;&nbsp; talked about and then your websites. Governor&nbsp; and ourselves and um the case for Canada um&nbsp;&nbsp; these get these on Amazon and through my website&nbsp; murderby.com. I'm at angelfire101protonail.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; and do arrange something in our communities&nbsp; where um I can come and speak and also send&nbsp;&nbsp; people to you who are in your area because like&nbsp; I say, I'll be giving you updates soon about&nbsp;&nbsp; this new declaration of independence, the new&nbsp; constitutional assembly setting up around America&nbsp;&nbsp; and the new republic of Albon in England. And&nbsp; then you're also at Republic of Canada too.org.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you. Yes. I want to show um on my channel&nbsp; and there's also a link that I always put in&nbsp;&nbsp; the show notes um Kevin's incredible documentary&nbsp; Unrepentant which actually features him features&nbsp;&nbsp; the voices of survivors sharing their stories and&nbsp; shares about the systemic genocide as well as what&nbsp;&nbsp; what they were doing about it at this time and and&nbsp; the different progresses that they were making.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just an extraordinary piece of work that has&nbsp; really stood the test of time and is still so,&nbsp;&nbsp; if not more accurate and important today to watch&nbsp; than even back then. This was way before its time,&nbsp;&nbsp; the stuff that you were talking about here, but&nbsp; and so timely for today for people to learn from.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I did air this on on my channel, so you can&nbsp; go and actually watch it right on the channel&nbsp;&nbsp; that you're watching right now. Um, and he's also&nbsp; has sort of a more official version that's on a&nbsp;&nbsp; different channel that I always link in the show&nbsp; notes. And then Kevin, you do you do podcasts on&nbsp;&nbsp; so many other podcasts right now, including&nbsp; Sean Atwood, which is amazing because I know&nbsp;&nbsp; that that's helping sort of get your work out to&nbsp; different people in this community on a very large&nbsp;&nbsp; platform. But you have your own show, too. Could&nbsp; you talk just a little bit about that? Radio Free&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada. It's um every first and third Sunday of&nbsp; every month, and it's at uh 12 noon Eastern time.&nbsp;&nbsp; bbsradio.comradio free Canada and we're going to&nbsp; be using that with the give it as a platform for&nbsp;&nbsp; the new American republic movement starting up&nbsp; so you'll hear more of those folks there thank&nbsp;&nbsp; you Emma this has been really fantastic and I know&nbsp; we'll use this broadcast really well yes this was&nbsp;&nbsp; a a jam-packed episode that I think somebody&nbsp; could listen to over and over and over again&nbsp;&nbsp; and a really great one too for all ages like you&nbsp; said you know some of these shows can be a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit explicit this is a really good one to share if&nbsp; you do have high schooler kids or you know younger&nbsp;&nbsp; generations or if you guys are in any groups or&nbsp; can share this um with people that would find&nbsp;&nbsp; value in it. I would really appreciate that. Um&nbsp; I'll have Kevin's books linked below, especially&nbsp;&nbsp; the three that that we talked about today. Um&nbsp; that way you guys can go empower yourselves,&nbsp;&nbsp; learn how you guys can take action in your own&nbsp; communities, and of course support Kevin so he can&nbsp;&nbsp; continue doing this work. It's really important&nbsp; that we support people creating resources for us&nbsp;&nbsp; and and Kevin has no shortage of them. Um, you&nbsp; can also visit Murder by Decree, his website,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, which will take you to his platform or&nbsp; I should say his page that has a listing of&nbsp;&nbsp; all of his books. Kevin has tons of books. So,&nbsp; um, we're just sharing three main ones today,&nbsp;&nbsp; but from his website, you can go check out his&nbsp; entire library, which is extremely impressive.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll have his documentary below, his radio show,&nbsp; all his other websites, Republic of Canada. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and Kevin, it's just a joy having you on. You're&nbsp; a wealth of knowledge and inspiration, and you you&nbsp;&nbsp; are a true hero. Thank you, Emma. You're welcome.&nbsp; And thank you guys for listening. Of course,&nbsp;&nbsp; we'll have Kevin back on again soon. Um, we have&nbsp; so much with him that we can talk about. We're&nbsp;&nbsp; really lucky. But again, share this episode.&nbsp; I'll have my links in the show notes as well,&nbsp;&nbsp; you guys. Thank you so much for listening.&nbsp; God bless you all and we will see you next",

So um uh work and looking for new ones. So um uh the<00:55:35.760><c> citizens</c><00:55:36.319><c> tribunal</c><00:55:37.520><c> they</c><00:55:37.760><c> were</c><00:55:37.920><c> open</c><00:55:38.160><c> for</c> the citizens tribunal they were open for the citizens tribunal they were open for that<00:55:38.720><c> they</c><00:55:38.960><c> they</c><00:55:39.280><c> needed</c><00:55:39.680><c> some</c><00:55:40.079><c> structure.</c><00:55:40.880><c> So</c> that they they needed some structure. So that they they needed some structure.
