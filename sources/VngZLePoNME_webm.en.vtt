00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
to tell her what's going on with me. So
 

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:25.830 align:start position:0%
to tell her what's going on with me. So
I<00:22:22.799><c> went</c><00:22:22.960><c> to</c><00:22:23.120><c> my</c><00:22:23.360><c> dad</c><00:22:24.400><c> and</c><00:22:25.039><c> he's</c><00:22:25.360><c> like,</c><00:22:25.520><c> "Oh,</c>

just eat lots of carrots. Worms don't
 

00:22:27.919 --> 00:22:31.430 align:start position:0%
just eat lots of carrots. Worms don't
like<00:22:28.159><c> carrots."</c><00:22:29.280><c> And</c><00:22:29.520><c> so</c><00:22:30.400><c> this</c><00:22:30.640><c> was</c><00:22:30.799><c> my</c><00:22:31.120><c> life.</c>

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:37.590 align:start position:0%
like carrots." And so this was my life.
So,<00:22:32.559><c> I</c><00:22:32.799><c> had</c><00:22:33.039><c> to</c><00:22:34.159><c> live</c><00:22:34.559><c> with</c><00:22:35.600><c> the</c><00:22:35.840><c> fear</c><00:22:36.880><c> of</c><00:22:37.120><c> that,</c>

go to the bathroom? I mean, a lot. And
 

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:41.829 align:start position:0%
go to the bathroom? I mean, a lot. And

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
And and same thing with washing hands.
 

01:00:56.079 --> 01:00:58.309 align:start position:0%
And and same thing with washing hands.
And<01:00:56.319><c> I</c><01:00:56.480><c> know</c><01:00:56.640><c> that</c><01:00:56.880><c> a</c><01:00:57.119><c> lot</c><01:00:57.200><c> of</c><01:00:57.359><c> survivors</c><01:00:58.000><c> have</c>

01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
And I know that a lot of survivors have
 

01:00:58.319 --> 01:01:00.309 align:start position:0%
And I know that a lot of survivors have
handwashing<01:00:59.200><c> and</c><01:00:59.440><c> they</c><01:00:59.760><c> don't</c><01:01:00.000><c> always</c>

01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
handwashing and they don't always
 

01:01:00.319 --> 01:01:03.670 align:start position:0%
handwashing and they don't always
realize<01:01:01.440><c> that</c><01:01:02.160><c> there's</c><01:01:02.640><c> some</c><01:01:02.880><c> stuff</c><01:01:03.200><c> behind</c>

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
realize that there's some stuff behind
 

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:06.789 align:start position:0%
realize that there's some stuff behind
all<01:01:03.920><c> of</c><01:01:04.079><c> that.</c><01:01:04.880><c> And</c><01:01:05.119><c> so</c><01:01:05.599><c> the</c><01:01:05.920><c> belief</c><01:01:06.319><c> then</c><01:01:06.559><c> is</c>

01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
all of that. And so the belief then is
 

01:01:06.799 --> 01:01:09.670 align:start position:0%
all of that. And so the belief then is
that<01:01:07.040><c> every</c><01:01:07.359><c> time</c><01:01:07.520><c> you</c><01:01:07.760><c> wash</c><01:01:07.920><c> your</c><01:01:08.160><c> hands</c><01:01:09.520><c> uh</c>

and you're you're also like it's like a

and you're you're also like it's like a
conditioned<01:01:22.480><c> thing</c><01:01:22.640><c> to</c><01:01:22.880><c> then</c><01:01:23.119><c> believe</c><01:01:23.359><c> that</c>

01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
conditioned thing to then believe that

nothing<01:01:23.839><c> has</c><01:01:24.160><c> happened.</c><01:01:25.359><c> you</c><01:01:25.680><c> they</c><01:01:25.920><c> haven't</c>

01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
nothing has happened. you they haven't
 

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.589 align:start position:0%
nothing has happened. you they haven't
been<01:01:26.640><c> abused</c><01:01:27.680><c> and</c><01:01:28.000><c> all</c><01:01:28.160><c> of</c><01:01:28.319><c> these</c><01:01:28.640><c> things</c><01:01:29.359><c> are</c>

01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
been abused and all of these things are
 

01:01:29.599 --> 01:01:31.829 align:start position:0%
been abused and all of these things are
just<01:01:29.839><c> washed</c><01:01:30.240><c> away.</c><01:01:30.960><c> I</c><01:01:31.119><c> mean,</c><01:01:31.280><c> it's</c><01:01:31.359><c> it's</c><01:01:31.680><c> a</c>

01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
just washed away. I mean, it's it's a
 

01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:35.910 align:start position:0%
just washed away. I mean, it's it's a
twofold<01:01:32.400><c> thing.</c><01:01:33.200><c> And</c><01:01:33.440><c> so</c><01:01:33.680><c> then</c>

01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
twofold thing. And so then
 

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:39.430 align:start position:0%
twofold thing. And so then
that<01:01:36.240><c> meant</c><01:01:36.720><c> that</c><01:01:37.599><c> when</c><01:01:37.920><c> I</c><01:01:38.160><c> became</c><01:01:38.400><c> an</c><01:01:38.640><c> adult,</c>

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
that meant that when I became an adult,
 

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:42.870 align:start position:0%
that meant that when I became an adult,
I<01:01:39.760><c> was</c><01:01:40.000><c> conditioned</c><01:01:40.480><c> to</c><01:01:40.720><c> do</c><01:01:40.960><c> the</c><01:01:41.200><c> same</c><01:01:41.520><c> things.</c>

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
I was conditioned to do the same things.
 

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:46.630 align:start position:0%
I was conditioned to do the same things.
And<01:01:43.760><c> so</c><01:01:44.079><c> by</c><01:01:44.400><c> breaking</c><01:01:44.799><c> free</c><01:01:45.280><c> and</c><01:01:45.599><c> getting</c><01:01:45.920><c> away</c>

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
And so by breaking free and getting away
 

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:53.670 align:start position:0%
And so by breaking free and getting away
and<01:01:47.760><c> um</c><01:01:48.720><c> so</c><01:01:49.359><c> that</c><01:01:50.720><c> interrupts</c><01:01:51.359><c> that</c><01:01:52.720><c> um</c>

01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
and um so that interrupts that um
 

01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.950 align:start position:0%
and um so that interrupts that um
passing<01:01:54.160><c> it</c><01:01:54.319><c> down</c><01:01:54.799><c> and</c><01:01:55.119><c> that</c><01:01:55.359><c> interrupts</c>

01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
passing it down and that interrupts
 

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.030 align:start position:0%
passing it down and that interrupts
uh<01:01:57.200><c> the</c><01:01:57.520><c> stuff</c><01:01:57.680><c> that</c><01:01:57.920><c> you're</c><01:01:58.160><c> supposed</c><01:01:58.480><c> to</c><01:01:58.720><c> to</c>

01:10:36.159 --> 01:10:39.030 align:start position:0%
drugging that they did. So, I felt like

I was paralyzed and I couldn't move or

I was paralyzed and I couldn't move or

if what they were doing to my brain was

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
causing this. I don't know. But so, they
 

01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.990 align:start position:0%
causing this. I don't know. But so, they
would<01:10:46.400><c> say</c><01:10:46.719><c> things</c><01:10:46.960><c> to</c><01:10:47.120><c> me</c><01:10:47.360><c> while</c><01:10:47.679><c> they're</c>

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
would say things to me while they're
 

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.510 align:start position:0%
would say things to me while they're

01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
doing this, well, move your right hand,
 

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:54.950 align:start position:0%
doing this, well, move your right hand,
you<01:10:51.760><c> know,</c><01:10:52.400><c> move</c><01:10:52.719><c> your</c><01:10:53.280><c> toes.</c><01:10:54.239><c> And</c><01:10:54.480><c> I</c><01:10:54.640><c> couldn't</c>

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know, move your toes. And I couldn't
 

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:59.350 align:start position:0%
you know, move your toes. And I couldn't
move<01:10:55.120><c> my</c><01:10:55.360><c> toes.</c><01:10:56.480><c> And</c><01:10:56.880><c> so</c><01:10:57.679><c> then</c><01:10:58.800><c> because</c><01:10:59.120><c> I</c>

01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
move my toes. And so then because I
 

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.430 align:start position:0%
move my toes. And so then because I
couldn't<01:10:59.760><c> move</c>

01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't move
 

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.750 align:start position:0%
couldn't move
then<01:11:01.760><c> they</c><01:11:02.000><c> would</c><01:11:02.159><c> give</c><01:11:02.320><c> me</c><01:11:02.640><c> electric</c><01:11:03.120><c> shock</c>

01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
then they would give me electric shock
 

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.470 align:start position:0%
then they would give me electric shock
to<01:11:04.000><c> punish</c><01:11:04.400><c> me</c><01:11:05.120><c> because</c><01:11:05.440><c> I</c><01:11:05.679><c> didn't</c><01:11:05.920><c> do</c><01:11:06.080><c> what</c><01:11:06.320><c> I</c>

01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
to punish me because I didn't do what I

01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%

01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
at this uh CT scan in front of my eyes
 

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.510 align:start position:0%
at this uh CT scan in front of my eyes
on<01:13:42.880><c> my</c><01:13:43.040><c> computer</c><01:13:44.239><c> and</c><01:13:45.280><c> what</c><01:13:45.600><c> they</c><01:13:45.920><c> found</c><01:13:47.040><c> um</c><01:13:47.280><c> on</c>

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
on my computer and what they found um on
 

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.870 align:start position:0%
on my computer and what they found um on
this<01:13:47.760><c> CT</c><01:13:48.239><c> scan</c><01:13:48.640><c> at</c><01:13:48.880><c> the</c><01:13:49.040><c> time</c><01:13:49.199><c> they</c><01:13:49.440><c> said</c><01:13:50.159><c> well</c>

01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
this CT scan at the time they said well
 

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:53.510 align:start position:0%
this CT scan at the time they said well
I<01:13:51.120><c> encourage</c><01:13:51.520><c> you</c><01:13:51.679><c> to</c><01:13:51.840><c> get</c><01:13:52.000><c> some</c><01:13:52.239><c> neurological</c>

01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
I encourage you to get some neurological
 

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:57.030 align:start position:0%
I encourage you to get some neurological
um<01:13:54.239><c> workups</c><01:13:55.120><c> to</c><01:13:55.440><c> follow</c><01:13:55.760><c> through</c><01:13:56.000><c> with</c><01:13:56.239><c> this.</c>

01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
um workups to follow through with this.
 

01:13:57.040 --> 01:13:58.870 align:start position:0%
um workups to follow through with this.
But<01:13:57.280><c> when</c><01:13:57.440><c> I</c><01:13:57.600><c> mentioned</c><01:13:57.840><c> that</c><01:13:58.000><c> I</c><01:13:58.239><c> had</c><01:13:58.480><c> had</c>

01:13:58.870 --> 01:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
But when I mentioned that I had had
 

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:02.229 align:start position:0%
But when I mentioned that I had had
severe<01:13:59.360><c> trauma,</c><01:14:00.400><c> then</c><01:14:00.719><c> the</c><01:14:01.040><c> ENT</c><01:14:01.679><c> doctor</c><01:14:02.000><c> was</c>

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
severe trauma, then the ENT doctor was
 

01:14:02.239 --> 01:14:05.030 align:start position:0%
severe trauma, then the ENT doctor was
like,<01:14:02.320><c> "Oh,</c><01:14:02.800><c> okay.</c><01:14:03.120><c> That</c><01:14:03.360><c> explains</c><01:14:03.760><c> it."</c><01:14:04.719><c> So</c>

01:14:05.030 --> 01:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
like, "Oh, okay. That explains it." So
 

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.430 align:start position:0%
like, "Oh, okay. That explains it." So
anyway,<01:14:05.760><c> what</c><01:14:06.080><c> is</c><01:14:06.320><c> on</c><01:14:06.640><c> my</c><01:14:07.679><c> uh</c><01:14:07.920><c> CT</c><01:14:08.560><c> scan</c><01:14:08.960><c> report</c>

that's what they're supposed to do. And
 

02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:11.589 align:start position:0%
that's what they're supposed to do. And

02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
programmed to do these things and it
 

02:21:17.439 --> 02:21:19.750 align:start position:0%
programmed to do these things and it
would<02:21:17.600><c> usually</c><02:21:18.000><c> be</c><02:21:18.319><c> when</c><02:21:18.560><c> I</c><02:21:18.720><c> was</c><02:21:19.280><c> getting</c>

would usually be when I was getting
 

02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:21.349 align:start position:0%
would usually be when I was getting

02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
supposed to remember. And so this part
 

02:21:23.439 --> 02:21:25.990 align:start position:0%
supposed to remember. And so this part
was<02:21:24.160><c> the</c><02:21:24.479><c> conditioned</c><02:21:24.960><c> part</c><02:21:25.280><c> that</c><02:21:25.600><c> was</c>

02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
was the conditioned part that was

02:22:45.910 --> 02:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
or cuz um that word is actually a
 

02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:49.190 align:start position:0%
or cuz um that word is actually a
conditioned<02:22:46.399><c> thing.</c><02:22:46.880><c> So</c><02:22:47.760><c> if</c><02:22:48.000><c> a</c><02:22:48.240><c> person</c><02:22:48.880><c> that</c>

02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
conditioned thing. So if a person that
 

02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:52.389 align:start position:0%
conditioned thing. So if a person that
is<02:22:49.439><c> programmed</c><02:22:50.000><c> calls</c><02:22:50.319><c> 911,</c><02:22:51.600><c> that</c><02:22:51.920><c> actually</c>

02:22:52.389 --> 02:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
is programmed calls 911, that actually
 

02:22:52.399 --> 02:22:53.910 align:start position:0%
is programmed calls 911, that actually
activates

02:22:53.910 --> 02:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
activates
 

02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:57.990 align:start position:0%
activates
some<02:22:55.120><c> in</c><02:22:55.359><c> me</c><02:22:55.600><c> anyway,</c><02:22:56.080><c> it</c><02:22:56.399><c> activated</c><02:22:57.600><c> more</c>

02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
some in me anyway, it activated more
 

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.469 align:start position:0%
some in me anyway, it activated more
programming<02:22:58.640><c> on</c><02:22:58.880><c> top</c><02:22:59.040><c> of</c><02:22:59.280><c> what</c><02:22:59.439><c> I</c><02:22:59.680><c> was</c><02:22:59.840><c> already</c>

02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
programming on top of what I was already
 

02:23:00.479 --> 02:23:03.030 align:start position:0%
programming on top of what I was already
going<02:23:00.720><c> through</c><02:23:01.520><c> because</c><02:23:02.000><c> reporter</c><02:23:02.479><c> parts</c><02:23:02.800><c> are</c>

02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
going through because reporter parts are
 

02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:06.309 align:start position:0%
going through because reporter parts are
supposed<02:23:03.359><c> to</c><02:23:03.600><c> call</c><02:23:04.080><c> someone.</c>

02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to call someone.
 

02:23:06.319 --> 02:23:11.030 align:start position:0%
supposed to call someone.
And<02:23:06.640><c> so</c><02:23:07.680><c> in</c><02:23:08.080><c> doing</c><02:23:08.399><c> that,</c><02:23:09.040><c> it</c><02:23:09.359><c> sets</c><02:23:09.680><c> off</c><02:23:09.920><c> a</c><02:23:10.240><c> lot</c>

02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
And so in doing that, it sets off a lot
 

02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:13.910 align:start position:0%
And so in doing that, it sets off a lot
more<02:23:11.600><c> programming.</c><02:23:12.399><c> And</c><02:23:12.640><c> then</c><02:23:13.280><c> that</c><02:23:13.600><c> can</c><02:23:13.760><c> get</c>

02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
more programming. And then that can get
 

02:23:13.920 --> 02:23:18.630 align:start position:0%
more programming. And then that can get
into<02:23:14.160><c> a</c><02:23:14.399><c> lot</c><02:23:14.560><c> more</c><02:23:14.800><c> complicated</c><02:23:16.000><c> um</c><02:23:16.960><c> um</c><02:23:18.319><c> harm</c>

02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
into a lot more complicated um um harm
 

02:23:18.640 --> 02:23:21.110 align:start position:0%
into a lot more complicated um um harm
in<02:23:18.960><c> itself</c><02:23:19.920><c> where</c><02:23:20.160><c> it's</c><02:23:20.399><c> actually</c><02:23:20.720><c> causing</c>

02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
in itself where it's actually causing
 

02:23:21.120 --> 02:23:24.870 align:start position:0%
in itself where it's actually causing
the<02:23:21.359><c> person</c><02:23:21.680><c> harm</c><02:23:22.319><c> instead</c><02:23:22.720><c> of</c><02:23:22.880><c> helping.</c><02:23:24.160><c> Um</c>

02:23:24.870 --> 02:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
the person harm instead of helping. Um
 

02:23:24.880 --> 02:23:27.830 align:start position:0%
the person harm instead of helping. Um
we're<02:23:25.200><c> not</c><02:23:25.359><c> supposed</c><02:23:25.680><c> to</c><02:23:26.000><c> ever</c><02:23:26.399><c> get</c><02:23:26.640><c> real</c><02:23:26.960><c> help</c>

02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to ever get real help
 

02:23:27.840 --> 02:23:30.389 align:start position:0%
we're not supposed to ever get real help
is,<02:23:28.240><c> you</c><02:23:28.399><c> know,</c><02:23:28.479><c> the</c><02:23:28.800><c> conditioned</c><02:23:29.359><c> belief.</c>

02:23:30.389 --> 02:23:30.399 align:start position:0%
is, you know, the conditioned belief.
 

02:23:30.399 --> 02:23:33.510 align:start position:0%
is, you know, the conditioned belief.
And<02:23:30.640><c> so</c><02:23:31.280><c> I</c><02:23:31.600><c> do</c><02:23:31.840><c> not</c><02:23:32.000><c> recommend</c><02:23:32.479><c> going</c><02:23:32.720><c> to</c><02:23:32.880><c> an</c><02:23:33.120><c> ER</c>

02:23:33.510 --> 02:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
And so I do not recommend going to an ER
 

02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:36.389 align:start position:0%
And so I do not recommend going to an ER
unless<02:23:33.840><c> you</c><02:23:34.080><c> absolutely</c><02:23:34.560><c> have</c><02:23:34.800><c> to.</c><02:23:36.000><c> I</c>

02:23:36.389 --> 02:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
unless you absolutely have to. I
 

02:23:36.399 --> 02:23:40.950 align:start position:0%
unless you absolutely have to. I
recommend<02:23:37.439><c> talking</c><02:23:38.000><c> with</c><02:23:38.399><c> someone</c><02:23:39.760><c> that</c><02:23:40.720><c> you</c>

02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
recommend talking with someone that you
 

02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:43.110 align:start position:0%
recommend talking with someone that you
can<02:23:41.200><c> really</c><02:23:41.600><c> trust</c>

02:23:43.110 --> 02:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
can really trust
 

02:23:43.120 --> 02:23:44.870 align:start position:0%
can really trust

could use the ice machine, but I didn't
 

02:33:07.680 --> 02:33:09.830 align:start position:0%
could use the ice machine, but I didn't

02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
get the care that I needed physically. I
 

02:33:09.840 --> 02:33:11.670 align:start position:0%
get the care that I needed physically. I
was<02:33:10.000><c> only</c><02:33:10.240><c> two</c><02:33:10.479><c> weeks</c>

02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
was only two weeks
 

02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:15.030 align:start position:0%
was only two weeks
out<02:33:11.920><c> of</c><02:33:12.160><c> having</c><02:33:12.640><c> a</c><02:33:12.880><c> total</c><02:33:13.200><c> knee</c><02:33:13.520><c> replaced.</c>

out of having a total knee replaced.
 

02:33:15.040 --> 02:33:18.630 align:start position:0%
out of having a total knee replaced.
But<02:33:15.200><c> what</c><02:33:15.439><c> I</c><02:33:15.680><c> learned</c><02:33:16.000><c> in</c><02:33:16.319><c> in</c><02:33:16.800><c> that</c><02:33:17.200><c> time</c><02:33:18.319><c> is</c>

02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
But what I learned in in that time is
 

02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:22.469 align:start position:0%
But what I learned in in that time is
that<02:33:20.080><c> God</c><02:33:20.399><c> was</c><02:33:20.640><c> really</c><02:33:20.960><c> there</c><02:33:21.200><c> for</c><02:33:21.439><c> me.</c><02:33:22.319><c> You</c>

02:33:22.469 --> 02:33:22.479 align:start position:0%
that God was really there for me. You
 

02:33:22.479 --> 02:33:25.750 align:start position:0%
that God was really there for me. You
know,<02:33:22.640><c> he</c><02:33:22.880><c> didn't</c><02:33:23.200><c> leave</c><02:33:23.439><c> me.</c><02:33:24.399><c> And</c><02:33:24.560><c> I</c><02:33:24.880><c> knew</c>

02:33:25.750 --> 02:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
know, he didn't leave me. And I knew
 

02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:29.750 align:start position:0%
know, he didn't leave me. And I knew
that<02:33:26.399><c> he</c><02:33:26.640><c> allowed</c><02:33:26.960><c> it</c><02:33:27.200><c> for</c><02:33:27.359><c> a</c><02:33:27.600><c> purpose.</c><02:33:28.800><c> And</c><02:33:29.040><c> so</c>

02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
that he allowed it for a purpose. And so
