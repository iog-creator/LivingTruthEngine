00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.200
Heavenly Father, today we put on the full armor&nbsp;
to protect us against attack. We put on the belt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.400
of truth to protect against lies and deception. We&nbsp;
put on the breastplate of righteousness to protect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.080
our hearts from the temptations. We put the gospel&nbsp;
of peace on our feet to walk in your light, peace,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.520
and freedom with the Holy Spirit. We rebuke&nbsp;
anxious thoughts. We take up your shield of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.640
faith for protection to block and destroy all&nbsp;
the darts and threats thrown at us by the enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.280
We put on the helmet of salvation to cover our&nbsp;
minds and thoughts, reminding us that we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.920
children of a mighty king. We are forgiven, set&nbsp;
free, saved by the blood of Jesus. We take up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.720
sword of the spirit, your living word that has the&nbsp;
power to demolish strongholds and is sharper than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:52.720
any double-edged sword. We come to you, Lord, in&nbsp;
prayer daily. In Jesus mighty name we pray. Amen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.480
What's up, you guys? Welcome to the Imagination.&nbsp;
I'm your host, Emma, and today I'm honored to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.560
back on the show for part two of her testimony&nbsp;
series, Satanic Ritual Abuse, Mind Control,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.680
Stargate, Freemason, Jesuit, an organized abuse&nbsp;
survivor, overcomer, and whistleblower, loving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.320
mother, founder of The Quickening Project, content&nbsp;
creator and podcast host, faithful servant to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.520
most high, gardener, floral design extraordinaire,&nbsp;
singer and songwriter, poetry reader and writer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.720
and absolute inspiration, Kadia. In case you&nbsp;
missed Kadia's incredible debut episode on this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.120
podcast, it'll be below in the show notes.&nbsp;
And here is a brief overview of her life,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.720
as well as some things we may be discussing&nbsp;
today for part two. Kadia's life began in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.000
web of multi-generational abuse orchestrated by a&nbsp;
highle cult with ties to Freemasonry, the Vatican,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.440
the Jesuits, and military intelligence programs.&nbsp;
From infancy, and possibly even Udo, she endured&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.640
deliberate trauma designed to fracture her psyche,&nbsp;
creating dissociative identity disorder to mold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.960
her into a mind-controlled operative. Raised&nbsp;
in a seemingly happy Christian family, Kadia's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.640
front personality was unaware of the horrific&nbsp;
rituals and programming conducted in churches,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.880
Masonic lodges, and even a major movie theater&nbsp;
that shaped her fragmented identities. These&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.640
included being trafficked to the Vatican for a&nbsp;
luciferian ritual, subjected to electroshock,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.760
drowning, and drugging to simulate death, and&nbsp;
training in programs like Stargate for remote&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.160
viewing and espionage. As a child, she was forced&nbsp;
to participate in heinous acts, including filming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.480
stuff films on a church missing trip under the&nbsp;
guise of helping an orphanage. Her abusers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.600
including a 33rd degree Freemason programmer&nbsp;
who studied neurology to perfect mind control,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.640
exploited her high IQ and spiritual gifts,&nbsp;
using children's books like Dr. Seuss and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.200
the music and keys of a piano to create&nbsp;
a highly organized system of altars.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.840
Despite this, Kadia's awakening began in her 20s&nbsp;
when chronic illness defied medical diagnosis,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.560
hinting at trauma-based origins. As memories of&nbsp;
ritual abuse flooded back just a few years ago,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.680
she faced disbelief from family, friends, and&nbsp;
authorities, culminating in a betrayal that cost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.440
her everything. Her husband filed for divorce. A&nbsp;
protection order barred her from her two children,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.360
and her resources were stripped away. The&nbsp;
cult's playbook using the Darvo method left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.200
her ostracized, gangstaled, and battling self&nbsp;
harm programming. Yet guided by her faith,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.720
Kadiah found refuge with a supportive family and&nbsp;
enrolled in Restoration in Christ Ministries, a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.880
program that became a cornerstone of her healing.&nbsp;
Kadia's escape was a miracle marked by divine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.960
intervention, including surviving a kidnapping&nbsp;
attempt. Her faith in Yaw became her anchor.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.960
Recognizing that Christian terminology and music,&nbsp;
often used in rituals, can retraumatize survivors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.640
Kadia launched the Quickening Project, a&nbsp;
podcast and music initiative. She creates&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.840
worship music designed to soothe fractured souls&nbsp;
without triggering trauma, and she offers a safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.000
space for survivors to reconnect with faith. The&nbsp;
project also educates on the realities of SRRA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.840
did and cult tactics, exposing the prevalence&nbsp;
in institutions like churches, schools, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.480
even pizza chains used as friends for trafficking.&nbsp;
Today, we will be continuing Kadaya's testimony,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.200
sharing aspects of her story that weren't&nbsp;
discussed last time. And some of those topics will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.600
be things like mind control programming locations,&nbsp;
psychward experiences, youth method, abuse methods&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.800
that do not leave marks, and sematic body memory&nbsp;
experiences, SRA and scripture, Antarctica,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.880
the state sanctioned kidnap of children, and so&nbsp;
much more. Kadia's mission is not of vengeance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.560
but of healing and empowerment. Her work addresses&nbsp;
the epidemic of hidden abuse, drawing parallels to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.280
biblical warnings of lawlessness and false light.&nbsp;
By sharing her testimony, she validates survivors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.320
showing them that the cult's tactics, like&nbsp;
weaponizing children or inducing despair,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.760
are proof of their truth. Her message is&nbsp;
clear. Healing is possible through faith,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.960
honesty, and with the Holy Spirit. Kadia's&nbsp;
story, still unfolding as she fights to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.800
unite with her children, is a powerful call to&nbsp;
action. inspiring survivors to break free and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.080
society to confront the darkness in plain sight.&nbsp;
Through things like the Quickening Project,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.800
Kadia is not just surviving, she is thriving and&nbsp;
turning her pain into a divine purpose to set the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.080
captives free. Before wrapping up the introduction&nbsp;
of today's guest, I'd like to share just a couple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.320
quick reminders and updates. If you're interested&nbsp;

share any information privately with me, or if you&nbsp;
were interested in submitting a written testimony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.240
for my upcoming book series, or to be featured&nbsp;
on a Substack article, you can reach out to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.000
I've teamed up with a couple of my favorite&nbsp;
brands to offer you guys exclusive discount&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.080

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.720
notes below. Your support across all platforms is&nbsp;
greatly appreciated, you guys, especially as I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.280
had to shift to alternative streaming platforms&nbsp;
such as Rumble and X following the extreme&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.960
censorship that caused my last YouTube channel&nbsp;
to be terminated. I've just recently started a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.480
new YouTube channel and you can subscribe to me&nbsp;
there at the handle @ imaginationodcast official&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.400
that I am now streaming new episode premieres from&nbsp;
weekly. This transition to multiple platforms is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.120
crucial to continue sharing vital information&nbsp;
with the public and disclosure community. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:58.480
thank you all on the other side of the screen&nbsp;
for helping to make the imagination the safest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.320
space on the internet for survivor, whistleblower,&nbsp;
advocate and educator disclosures. Your support&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.520
means the absolute world to me and to every guest&nbsp;
on this show. So you guys, without further ado,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.800
please help me in welcoming back today's guest&nbsp;
of honor, voice for the voiceless, woman of God,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.200
survivor, warrior, fierce mama bear, walking&nbsp;
miracle, anti-child abuse, and survivor advocate,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.720
and a woman on a mission to equip other survivors&nbsp;
with what to expect when getting out through the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:33.520
power and hope of faith in Christ. The one,&nbsp;
the only, Kadia. Kadaya, thank you so much for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.360
being here again with us today. I'm so happy&nbsp;
to have you back. Thank you. Thank you. Wow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.880
that was a wonderful intro. I'm humbled. Thanks&nbsp;
for having me. And for those who've tuned in,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:52.080
thank you. It's an honor to have you back.&nbsp;
Your last episode was received so well. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:58.640
despite the fact that it was a longer episode&nbsp;
jam-packed with things, we had so many good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.040
comments and it provided so many puzzle pieces&nbsp;
for other people and helped them understand some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:07.440
of these big picture things that can be really&nbsp;
hard to understand in the little snippets that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.480
we see online. So, I'm really thrilled to have&nbsp;
you back and just so impressed with everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.120
that you've learned, everything that you've done,&nbsp;
all the healing that has taken place in such such&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:22.640
a short amount of time, and how you're able to&nbsp;
articulate these really, really hard concepts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.320
and experiences and things that exist in our&nbsp;
world in such a palatable way. So, I'm thrilled&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.480
to get into some of these subjects today. Um,&nbsp;
we do have a lot. So, just to let people know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.440
I did mention some things in the intro. if we&nbsp;
don't get to all of them, Kadia did agree to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.640
do a part three. So, and obviously I'd want her&nbsp;
on again anyways, but um if you don't hear about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:47.920
some of the topics today, we'll bring her back on&nbsp;
again happily and dive into some of those things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:52.480
but we're going to try to cover as much ground as&nbsp;
we can today. Um, and one of the topics that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:52.480 --> 00:09:00.080
we really wanted to share and and talk a little&nbsp;
bit deeper about is the topic of being admitted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:07.600
to psych wards, being called crazy after you start&nbsp;
to remember these very real reactions that people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:13.680
in these cults and people around survivors have.&nbsp;
Um, that sort of causes the opposite. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.640
we should be embracing survivors with healing&nbsp;
and help and helpful therapies that validate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.440
their experiences and instead um it's a very&nbsp;
real situation that a lot of survivors get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.440
treated the opposite and um penalized for what&nbsp;
they're remembering. And Kadia is no stranger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:35.520
to pretty much every experience you could sort of&nbsp;
imagine somebody having from the success of being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:41.760
received on podcast to how her family treated her&nbsp;
when a lot of this stuff started going down. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.480
Kadai, I'm going to turn it over to you and&nbsp;
let you share um your experiences about this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:50.560
and we can kind of dive into this topic&nbsp;
that's so relevant for survivors and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:58.880
normal civilians in society really need to know&nbsp;
about. Awesome. So, on the last interview we did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:06.000
uh we did dig into several of the topics that you&nbsp;
mentioned which was awesome. I'm going to try not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.720
to be redundant uh with some of the anecdotes of&nbsp;
information. So, I'm going to pick up where we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:23.040
left off pertaining to the timeline of events um&nbsp;
regarding my health journey, some of the symptoms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:29.040
uh my um the different people that I went&nbsp;
to for help. Uh we talked about all of that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:35.600
what happened, why I am where I am now. Um, but I&nbsp;
want to just touch on some of the details of what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:43.040
happened in some of those situations with uh&nbsp;
people that I had hoped to be able to trust,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:53.360
family members, uh, the authorities, um, pastors,&nbsp;
that kind of thing. Uh, because I want to prepare&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:00.000
those who are leaving these situations. And I I&nbsp;
see this as, you know, I see that there's a mass&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.720
exodus right now. Hallelujah. Um out of darkness&nbsp;
and in uh to the light of truth by his grace&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:14.880
alone. And by his grace, I mean God. And you're&nbsp;
going to hear me refer to God um you're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.960
to hear me refer to Jesus in a lot of the Hebrew&nbsp;
language because a lot of the English language was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.640
um used in my programming. That's something else&nbsp;
we talked about last time. Um, and so if you hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:33.680
me use Yah or Yahwa or Yahweh, I know some people&nbsp;
have controversy with that. Um, but that's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:40.480
what I have tended to use. That's been helpful in&nbsp;
my journey. So, if you hear me say that, uh, don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:47.280
be concerned. I'll just say upfront that my faith&nbsp;
is in the God of the Bible, the God of Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:55.200
the one and true risen lamb, um Jesus Christ,&nbsp;
Yeshua Hamashiach, uh the Messiah who has come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.480
to redeem us from the curse of sin and death and&nbsp;
all of the things these cults love, all of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:07.680
things that they do to enslave us. Um, and he&nbsp;
has come to save us, to heal us, and he is coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:16.080
again to exact justice on this kind of darkness,&nbsp;
on these hidden cults, on this wickedness. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:22.480
and uh, and uh, lead his people home. So, I&nbsp;
want to talk about what happened pertaining&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:26.880
to my children because that's not something that&nbsp;
we mentioned. So, maybe I'll just start there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:35.600
So uh this is you know one of the hardest things&nbsp;
for me to stay present uh to talk about um one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:44.240
of the gifts of dissociation um is uh that I can&nbsp;
um you know reach a a level in my point of grief&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:52.000
um and then in order to be able to survive I&nbsp;
can uh switch um into almost sort of a type&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.240
of amnesia to be able to focus on other tasks at&nbsp;
hand. It doesn't always work. There are a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:04.640
debilitating days where I suffer. So, uh, just&nbsp;
bear with me. Um, if I, you know, space out or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:11.920
space off, um, just give me a minute just to kind&nbsp;
of collect my thoughts and and come back. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.600
um, I was dealing with a lot of symptoms and&nbsp;
one of those things that I was dealing with was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:24.960
dissociative seizures. uh dissociative seizures&nbsp;
that were inhibiting my ability to function,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:32.160
to mother, uh to take care of my home, to work,&nbsp;
and to eventually drive. So, there were some years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:37.920
um leading up to my psycho board stay where&nbsp;
I was booking appointments with specialists,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:49.200
with neurologists. I had an EEG done to um try&nbsp;
to uh establish where some of these seizurike uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:55.760
electric like symptoms were coming from that were&nbsp;
just causing debilitating pain and an inability to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:01.680
function. And um I had I didn't know that there&nbsp;
was such a thing as dissociative seizures at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:08.480
time. And unfortunately um clinicians this is just&nbsp;
not something that is widely known about. And of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:15.760
course we know the whole medical establishment&nbsp;
um including the the world of psychiatry is is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:26.640
designed to create a a a veil uh of of false&nbsp;
help over um people who have who are victims of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:34.400
uh organized abuse especially. And so I wasn't&nbsp;
able to get a diagnosis, but this was something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:40.320
that I was dealing with and it is still something&nbsp;
that I'm dealing with in my healing journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:46.240
They are happening less frequently, but they&nbsp;
still happen. And so dissociative seizures,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:54.080
they resemble um they don't they sometimes can&nbsp;
resemble epileptic seizures, but not always. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:54.080 --> 00:15:02.720
and a lot of the the um symptomology surrounding&nbsp;
them is is freezing and an inability to articulate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:09.200
outwardly the the pain and the torment um that&nbsp;
is happening inside the body that is causing this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:17.120
seizing, this freezing up. Uh the brain will run&nbsp;
on a loop like a broken record. Um and so I had,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.240
you know, years where this would happen and I&nbsp;
would literally be beating my head against a wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:28.480
literally beating my head against a wall trying&nbsp;
to get my brain to work, my body to work, just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:37.200
so that I could easily move my limbs to get to a&nbsp;
bathroom or to go get a drink of water. I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:42.560
through through several years of this and it's&nbsp;
getting worse and worse and worse and worse and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:51.040
uh nobody seemed to really care or mind. Um, and&nbsp;
that's because I realize now they were all a part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:58.480
of this, um, this cult of mind control. And I&nbsp;
went through the specifics of of these cults,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:06.000
um, in the last interview. And so, um, I was going&nbsp;
through loss of consciousness. I was going through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:17.200
transances, stupers, um amnesia, hyperot seizures,&nbsp;
um sometimes muscle stiffness, sometimes tremors,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:25.120
uh a lot of twitching of the muscles. Um and so&nbsp;
they are now in the current diagnostic manual of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:32.240
the DSM, uh whatever we think about that, um&nbsp;
considered a manifestation of a dissociative,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:37.680
um or conversion disorder. And so they're&nbsp;
not actually under the patient's voluntary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:44.000
control and they're, you know, they're thought to&nbsp;
represent, you know, the patient, as we might say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.600
to represent their the response to emotional&nbsp;
stress. And so basically what had happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:59.040
is that my programming began to break down as I&nbsp;
began to resist the demands of the cult as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.800
as the programs that were installed inside of me.&nbsp;
Because when I got a hold of the truth through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:12.560
through Yah's word, through his written word,&nbsp;
um that awoke a war from the realm of darkness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.480
from covenants that I had made, that parts of&nbsp;
me had made that I didn't know that I had had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:26.400
that personalities had made under duress from the&nbsp;
cult under satanic ritual abuse, blood covenants,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:34.480
um oaths that were made uh both under duress&nbsp;
and also uh voluntarily. early. And so, um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:42.160
as I began to go through this process of renewing&nbsp;
my mind with his word, because his word is sharp,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:47.680
it's powerful, as a as a two-edged sword, able&nbsp;
to divide bone from marrow, the thoughts from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:55.600
the intents of the heart. I went through this&nbsp;
soul surgery, and it was shattering, heartending,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:05.680
painful, excruciating. Um, and it led to a nervous&nbsp;
breakdown. Uh, because as memories began to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:11.680
surface, because this is what happens when we pick&nbsp;
up his word and his light shines in the darkness,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.720
uh, the darkness is revealed. And so&nbsp;
those who were around me that were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:27.760
uh a couple handlers um and my head programmer um&nbsp;
began to crack down on um measures of torture to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:34.480
uh create ultimately a psychotic break that&nbsp;
would land me in the hospital. So then I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:44.720
that on my record now as a uh you know psych ward&nbsp;
patient or somebody who is me mentally ill. And so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:52.400
this is what happened. Um, I was in my home. Uh, a&nbsp;
friend had found me basically walking into walls,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:59.920
not able to function. Um, and crying out for&nbsp;
help because, uh, my children were home and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:06.880
was unable to find somebody to come over and help&nbsp;
me function, including my husband was completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:14.720
ignoring me. Um there was a a moment where I&nbsp;
pleaded that for to him for help not to go to work&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:20.960
because I was unable to care for the children.&nbsp;
And he just smiled and he said, "I know." And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:30.400
he walked out the door and I went, "Wow, I am&nbsp;
dealing with with a darker psychopathy uh than I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:37.680
realized." But that was incredibly validating. So,&nbsp;
long story short, and I go we went through some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:45.600
of these details. Um, uh, my friend had called&nbsp;
the police to help me exit the house safely, get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:53.280
away from the night, get away for the night. Um,&nbsp;
but, uh, my husband had intercepted and charmed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.280 --> 00:20:00.880
them and convinced them that I needed to be&nbsp;
medicated and taken to the psych ward. And so, um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:12.720
I complied. Um and while I was there um they were&nbsp;
unable to find anything wrong with me. Um and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:22.160
um after you know 6 days they had told me to that&nbsp;
I could check myself out um anytime. My experience&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:32.480
there was really hard um but um it was really&nbsp;
interesting. Uh, it was a really interesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:38.640
way that I was set free because one of the things&nbsp;
that my programmer did when I was young was put me&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:47.440
in a straight jacket in a simulated psych wart&nbsp;
situation to abuse and terrify me um of being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:54.400
in such a circumstance. In the event that I ever&nbsp;
began to share some of my memories in the began&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:02.240
that I ever in the event that I began to remember&nbsp;
the truth then I would be um sent to the psych&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:09.120
ward. So he actually broke off the fear of the&nbsp;
psych ward. Um God did he broke off the fear of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:17.040
that through the my experience in the psychward.&nbsp;
Now I I believe there are a lot of horrible things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:23.600
that happen in these types of institutions to&nbsp;
people but that was not my experience. I was I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:35.680
really protected by uh my heavenly father by Aba&nbsp;
um by Yah and um and while I was there um I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:44.720
actually uh given the opportunity um to help the&nbsp;
staff members which was kind of neat. Um, and um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:50.400
and uh, cuz they, you know, they I was I didn't&nbsp;
really want to be sitting still in my bed. I I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:56.800
didn't really want to participate too much in in&nbsp;
in some of the activities that they had going on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:05.360
Um and so um and this is just by the grace of&nbsp;
God alone um I was able to you know be a hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:13.920
on deck to calm some patients down um that were&nbsp;
um flying out of control. Um, and part of this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:19.040
because I understand programming and a lot of pe&nbsp;
a lot of the people that were in the psych board&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:29.120
um were simply um not mentally ill but victims&nbsp;
of uh organized abuse. And so I I um having gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:36.800
through this with a programmer, having had learned&nbsp;
to do some programming, was able to use some keys&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:44.160
in order to help create a more calm, a more safe&nbsp;
atmosphere in the psych ward so that some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:50.240
patients that were in the sort of higher security&nbsp;
uh side of the psych ward were actually able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:56.480
come and participate with some of the groups&nbsp;
group staff. So, as as traumatic as it was,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:02.240
I was kind of in awe and amused at what God&nbsp;
was doing in there. And he actually he showed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:10.880
me and validated for me that a lot of what are&nbsp;
um perceived as mental illnesses are actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:17.440
um um consequences that are installed in mind&nbsp;
control programming and procedures for people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.800
are trying to heal, who are trying to get help. If&nbsp;
you start to remember these programs kick in, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:29.440
cause hallucinations. They cause the hearing of&nbsp;
voices. Um there are parts um you know the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:36.160
purpose of DID is to keep a person um from knowing&nbsp;
that that they have it right. So if it's in an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:42.560
organized abuse setting, did is created to create&nbsp;
the ultimate mind control slave, the ultimate spy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:48.080
the ultimate assassin, whatever it is that doesn't&nbsp;
know that they have these parts inside of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:55.280
that programmers can bring out by uh certain codes&nbsp;
or maybe if they're a sex slave of some sort,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:01.120
somebody can buy your code. They can invite you&nbsp;
uh under false pretenses to an event. They'll use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:07.760
the code that they purchased from your programmer&nbsp;
wherever your program has been cataloged and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:16.080
that part that has been programmed to submit to&nbsp;
the abuse to perform a task um or to tolerate it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:24.000
or to take that you know comes out and then goes&nbsp;
back in after and it's it's not remembered. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.720
um, a lot of this stuff I was able to kind of&nbsp;
practice and test, oddly enough, as a patient in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:41.680
the psych ward. Um, so I I left the psych ward um,&nbsp;
having no diagnosis. Um, I was able to function&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:49.520
a little bit better just having had the rest and&nbsp;
space from my handler while I was in there. When&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:49.520 --> 00:25:03.200
I got out, I was taken back to my programmer's&nbsp;
home uh for six months to stay and recuperate. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:09.360
said to my handler, and I have to be careful about&nbsp;
disclosing specifics of relationships right now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:15.600
but this will all come forth very soon in&nbsp;
technical detail in an affidavit as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:21.920
as a book. Um, and so we'll talk a little bit&nbsp;
about that in a bit, but I begged and I pleaded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:28.640
and I said, "Do not take me, please. That is too&nbsp;
far away from my children. I want to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:36.880
see them. I'm not dangerous. I'm not delusional.&nbsp;
I'm just really sick and I'm having intermittent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:43.440
amnesia and memory memory floods." So, I begged&nbsp;
this person to drop me off at my church because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:50.080
I had read in scripture that if one is sick, you&nbsp;
can go to the elders of the church. They'll anoint&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:56.240
you with oil. They'll pray for you. If you have&nbsp;
any sins, you can confess them and be forgiven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:03.200
um by God, and then that sick person will be&nbsp;
made well. And so, I like to do things by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:08.960
book. I'm I'm a believer. I'm a faithful believer&nbsp;
in the word of Yah. So, this person took me to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:17.200
pastor's office and sat in with me during the&nbsp;
meeting. Um, and um I I said to the pastor, um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:27.200
I'm really sick. Uh, I believe I'm being abused.&nbsp;
Um, I tried to uh take escape for a night with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:35.520
my children to a friend's house and um um Oh,&nbsp;
sorry. This is really hard. this is the most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:41.360
the children is the thing with the children is the&nbsp;
most dramatic understand. And they said well they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.960
said well tell me about the abuse what's going&nbsp;
on and I said I don't know I don't remember and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:54.880
I began to cry and I I was just in despair. I kept&nbsp;
saying I don't remember. I don't remember. I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:03.680
know I do not trust this person. Right. Um I do&nbsp;
not trust this person and I don't know what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:10.960
Um, and so the pastor, you know, prayed for&nbsp;
me, but I begged. I said, "Can you please,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:17.440
is there somewhere somehow in the church, is&nbsp;
there somebody that I can talk to, somebody who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:22.640
maybe has been through an abusive situation who&nbsp;
could pray with me on a regular basis?" Like, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:32.720
was just so alone. I needed somebody or something.&nbsp;
And um this this pastor um um as it turned out um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:39.280
had been already contacted by my programmer where&nbsp;
I was supposed to be and they had decided that no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:48.400
matter what he I was to be encouraged to go back&nbsp;
to this place for six months to recuperate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.360
be reprogrammed. and I begged and I pleaded and I&nbsp;
said, "Please, I can't go back to the place that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:53.360 --> 00:28:04.240
I got sick." So, I went there. There was there&nbsp;
was nowhere else for me to go. While I was there,

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:17.040
um I just fasted and I prayed and I just I just&nbsp;
made um a a wall um where I wrote down all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:24.880
sins of the the family that I grew up in of of&nbsp;
this cult. every sin that I could think of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:33.440
had been committed in this cult, I wrote on the&nbsp;
wall and I fasted and I prayed and based on um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:41.440
inspiration from from Gideon in Judges 5 to7 where&nbsp;
he burned down his alt his father's altar to Baal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:47.200
I just did this and I knew this looks crazy. I'm&nbsp;
just fresh out of the psychord. If somebody comes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:58.160
in and they see a wall of sins, uh, everything&nbsp;
from gluttony to pedophilia to it was all there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:05.200
um if they see this, it's going to look crazy.&nbsp;
But I didn't care at this point because I knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:12.080
that I was sharing things that would cause me to&nbsp;
be accused as crazy on the veneer personalities of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.440
these people. But I knew that their personalities&nbsp;
underneath were hearing the message. Whether they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:23.120
were aware of those personalities or not, I don't&nbsp;
think they are. Of course, they can't couldn't be.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:30.880
I knew they were hearing the message and that&nbsp;
some would retaliate uh vindictively and try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:36.720
hunt and bury me, but that others would hear the&nbsp;
message of hope and see the doorway to freedom&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:44.080
and would come and leave this cult eventually.&nbsp;
And so I sat there and I fasted and I prayed for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:51.360
days. Um, and I just asked for Abba to come and&nbsp;
have mercy, to come and have grace, to come and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:57.600
break down these altars and these covenants that&nbsp;
have been made in my family going back, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:06.640
100 generations. And uh through this process&nbsp;
uh curses began to lift off me and there was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:15.360
some measure of healing that began to take place&nbsp;
not necessarily yet in my physical body but in my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:23.920
um in my mind. Um anxiety began to lift.&nbsp;
I began to sleep a little better. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:34.480
um um as I went through this process um of trying&nbsp;
to navigate this this mind control labyrinth and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:43.760
trying to escape it biblically in the in the&nbsp;
the location of captivity. I started to notice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:54.640
uh a a change happen in my captors where as I was&nbsp;
afraid of my programmer of my whole life, I began&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:54.640 --> 00:31:01.440
to notice there was this shift and he no longer&nbsp;
was able to be in the same room as me. I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:09.200
come into the room and he would scurry out. uh he&nbsp;
would not look me in the eyes and I was being very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:19.360
very I was being very much my usual loving um kind&nbsp;
self um and and and not bringing forward a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:27.680
the things that I was I was wrestling with. Um but&nbsp;
I noticed that there was just a tremendous change.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:36.000
And so as I was there for this 6 months um this&nbsp;
person uh began to be afraid of me for the first&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.360
time and that was very obvious and that's the&nbsp;
power of the Holy Spirit. That's the power of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:47.680
the light. That's the power of the truth. I was&nbsp;
in there now. I had come in on my authority as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:53.920
priest of the most high Yaheemed by the blood&nbsp;
of the lamb and his righteousness, not mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:53.920 --> 00:32:01.920
um through faith that power then came and began&nbsp;
to break veils off of me, break curses off of me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:09.840
and I began to walk in confidence and in authority&nbsp;
that all of this has been conquered and can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:17.040
conquered through the word and through Christ&nbsp;
and without even having to engage in this type&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:22.880
of dialogue with my handler and my programmer&nbsp;
at this location. the physical the the spiritual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:29.520
atmosphere began to change and I could tell&nbsp;
that they were afraid of me. And this was proven&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:38.800
uh because my programmer um threatened me one day&nbsp;
while I was staying there. Um, and he threatened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.520
me to be quiet because he could see I was no&nbsp;
longer afraid of him and he was getting afraid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:53.360
that I was going to start to speak what he knew&nbsp;
he had done to me. And I'd never accused him. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:53.360 --> 00:33:04.640
had never told him I remembered. And uh he came&nbsp;
to me in the backyard and he said to me that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:12.720
uh with his eyes spinning honestly like a sorcerer&nbsp;
uh he said to be quiet and he used a programming&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:20.560
code that didn't work anymore. Uh I was initiated&nbsp;
in a Masonic lodge under a virtue called quiet&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:31.440
strength and that was used to keep me quiet. um in&nbsp;
the uh Masonic order. And uh so he kept repeating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:38.400
to me quiet strength and I I kept kind of shruging&nbsp;
him off pretending. I wasn't really sure what he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:44.880
was talking about, but I knew. Then he snapped&nbsp;
his fingers, which is another which was another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:51.040
uh programming trigger that he had used so that I&nbsp;
would make eye contact with him. And he got in my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:58.480
face and he said again, "Quiet strength." and&nbsp;
he repeated my name, my my name that was used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:07.440
in the programming and for once I didn't&nbsp;
switch and I remained as I am in my new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:17.280
identity in Christ and I just looked him in the&nbsp;
eyes with sadness and I kissed him on the forehead&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:27.600
and I went for a walk and I praised I just praised&nbsp;
Yah on that trail and I just thanked him because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:36.480
knew in that moment that the curse in my family&nbsp;
had finally been broken and that it was only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:44.480
a matter of time for the manifestation of this&nbsp;
exodus to take place. And so I'm the first one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:51.360
out. I know there's going to be more to follow.&nbsp;
Um, I know some of the promises that Yahw has made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:59.440
to me and I saw the power of the programming&nbsp;
break down by his word and his love um, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:06.240
the gospel alone in that experience. And so I'm&nbsp;
very confident that he is going to do the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:12.800
I just have to in just pick up my cross and keep&nbsp;
following him and just endure the persecution,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:21.760
the slander, the bearing of false witness, the&nbsp;
twisting of different things and also the shame of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:29.920
some things that um are true. Um, and so that's&nbsp;
something that I'm continuing to sort of walk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:40.000
through is the the the the giving up of that fear&nbsp;
of man, the giving up of that shame to Christ and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:48.960
walking in basically my new identity, my new name&nbsp;
in him. And this is exactly the the purpose for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:55.760
which God gave his son for us in order to redeem&nbsp;
us from this kind of thing. Because we think that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:01.200
you know, sin, you know, in the Christian church,&nbsp;
sin is often just referred to as, oh, don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:06.720
sex before marriage or or don't, you know, swear&nbsp;
or don't this, don't that, you know, don't don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:16.080
be intoxicated. But according to scripture, the&nbsp;
eventual uh digression or denigration of of sin,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:25.760
which is simply um lawlessness, simply breaking&nbsp;
the law of Yahw is eventual denigration into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:34.960
human sacrifice. The reprobate mind of Romans 1.&nbsp;
it without without a compass and without a light.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:43.920
We can see through his word that um sin eventually&nbsp;
rolls downhill into the depths of this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:50.240
satanic ritual abuse and this kind of depravity&nbsp;
because these are this this these are the spirits&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:57.760
that are at work. This is the dark the dark power&nbsp;
that is at work. They need blood. They need human&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:04.960
sacrifice. They need perversion. They need these&nbsp;
kinds of energies from people in order for them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:10.880
accomplish, you know, the the agenda of the fallen&nbsp;
ones that we read about in Genesis. So, none of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:19.840
this is actually new. It's far more common than&nbsp;
anyone knows. It's not a conspiracy theory. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:28.080
it's all throughout scripture. It's all throughout&nbsp;
the ancient texts um including Enoch and Josher&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:35.280
um and the book of wisdom. I mean it's just&nbsp;
everywhere. But there is you know there is hope&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:44.400
and I saw his power come through in that situation&nbsp;
and restore me to a sound mind. Um and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:53.440
was really beautiful. But after the psych ward&nbsp;
experience and after the the six months um spent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:53.440 --> 00:38:01.600
at my original reprogram sorry with my original&nbsp;
programmer to reprogram me after the psych ward.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:08.000
So that so that happened um in order to reprogram&nbsp;
me and it didn't work because the power of God was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:17.360
was greater. After that, I returned back home to&nbsp;
be with my children. And I was healthier and freer&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:27.200
than I had ever been. And I and I during this time&nbsp;
had been calling um women's shelters because I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:34.880
so desperate to flee. I was so desperate to get&nbsp;
away. Um but y'all kept just kept saying, "Rain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:42.240
remain, remain. I have work for you to do to do&nbsp;
here." Um, and he had asked me if I was willing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:50.480
and I was. And um, and so I I didn't go to the&nbsp;
women's shelters. I ended up um, moving back home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:59.120
into the house with my children until the day&nbsp;
that I was dumped off out of the country with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:07.760
nothing but a an extra outfit besides the clothes&nbsp;
on my back and no warning. Financially cut off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:19.760
um homeless effectively um with nothing told that&nbsp;
my delusions my and my memories were false. Um my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:29.520
husband had said he was going to file for divorce.&nbsp;
The divorce papers came through a process server.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:35.280
Um and they were not divorce papers. They were a&nbsp;
protective order to forbid me from returning home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:44.720
to retrieve any of my belongings or come within a&nbsp;
thousand ft of my children. Uh, and this is how we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:50.560
know the judicial system is corrupt because like&nbsp;
the police were sent, a process server was sent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:57.280
with all these different types of things and and&nbsp;
the the the due process was different than what is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:04.400
actually typical. Um, and so we know, right, that&nbsp;
they have they have people positioned in all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:11.040
these different places. And anyone that is in the&nbsp;
cult has relationships with law enforcement. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:21.600
have relationships with judges, with lawyers. It's&nbsp;
not hard to do. And so, um, because I was so sick,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:29.440
um, I did not dispute the protective order, um,&nbsp;
because I was unable. I realized at this point to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:35.760
safely return and be anywhere near my abusers.&nbsp;
I couldn't heal if I was anywhere around them&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:41.840
at this point. And this was now a time for me to&nbsp;
pursue healing so that I could be healthy for my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:51.120
children so that I could fight for them so that&nbsp;
uh I they will be restored for me to me. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:51.120 --> 00:41:01.840
um I was eventually granted uh a visitation right&nbsp;
over the phone because I'm, you know, 5 hours away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:09.840
from them in a different country um in Canada.&nbsp;
Um my children are in Washington and they do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:16.000
this intentionally, right? They they have people&nbsp;
they you know they select your spouse for you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:21.920
there's a lot of uh this is really common across&nbsp;
the border because in the event that somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:30.000
begins to defy the cult um they can uh create a&nbsp;
tremendous legal hassle by putting them across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:42.480
the border um where it's difficult to really um to&nbsp;
really access any services or access any funds. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:49.040
like for example um I can't yeah there's there's&nbsp;
just a whole rigomeal of reasons I can't can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:56.400
even get on disability in order to get financial&nbsp;
help or anything like that. Um so it's kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:04.160
a nightmare. So I was I was kind of launched I&nbsp;
was catapulted out of the country. I was given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:15.280
uh half an hour on Tuesdays to talk to both of my&nbsp;
children together on the phone. under supervision.

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:25.840
And I did that three times. And um my children&nbsp;
were being so closely coerced and handled during&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:31.120
our conversations, what I was allowed to&nbsp;
say or talk about, what they were allowed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:36.800
to say or talk about that by the third visit,&nbsp;
and it's like you're just like it's I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:42.320
how stressful is that? You have half an hour once&nbsp;
a week on the phone just to see your kids. They do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:49.200
this just to torture mothers. It's just to torture&nbsp;
mothers. And my son actually had to lie down. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:56.320
got sick. Um because I had said to them, "Do you&nbsp;
understand where I went? I I would like to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.640
what you were told." Because I wasn't even given&nbsp;
the opportunity to say goodbye. I was just dumped&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:08.160
off somewhere. Um I said, I you know, it's not&nbsp;
my choice to be here. I wanted them to know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:15.280
I I did not leave them, that I was removed and I&nbsp;
was legally being prevented from returning home&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:21.440
to see them. And like I just I wanted to have&nbsp;
a conversation with him about it and it wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:27.360
even on the table. Um he was hauled out of the&nbsp;
room, came back in, said he wasn't allowed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:33.440
talk about it. Then he got dizzy and had to lay&nbsp;
down. This was my nine-year-old who's nine or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:44.080
um a 10 at this at this time. And so after that&nbsp;
third time, um I sent a message to my husband&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:51.440
and I said, "I am not agreeing to this anymore.&nbsp;
I will speak I will visit with my children. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:59.840
will speak with my children on my terms or not at&nbsp;
all. This is inhumane and this is abusive." And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:08.240
um and so um it's been about a year now, almost&nbsp;
a year now, and I have not had any contact with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:21.200
them physically or over the phone. I'm not I'm&nbsp;
struggling um today um to articulate this in a way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:30.640
that isn't in a a a you know in a way that is um&nbsp;
linear um and makes a lot of sense because it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:38.960
such a grief to me to not have access to them to&nbsp;
not be have even been able to have a conversation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:47.600
about with them about where I am or why or what&nbsp;
has happened. It is so cruel and so demented the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:58.720
way that I have been treated. Um, and I can't just&nbsp;
the trauma. Um, it's just a hard thing to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:04.720
about. So, that's why I'm kind of bouncing all&nbsp;
over the place. And, and because I have I'm split,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:08.880
um, I have a lot of parts. I have a lot of&nbsp;
different things to say. And so, I interrupt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:15.360
myself a lot. And so I just really appreciate&nbsp;
the grace of of you who are listening. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:21.200
and I hope you can kind of understand and kind of&nbsp;
follow and I I hope there's something um there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:27.520
somebody out there who who will feel less alone&nbsp;
through you know just hearing this experience. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:33.680
um you know I asked I I had I had requested&nbsp;
could I at least get some drawings. My oldest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:40.320
son especially is a just an phenomenal artist. Um&nbsp;
that was something really special that we used to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:50.480
do together and we used to bond together over&nbsp;
um I was not sent uh anything. Um absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:58.160
nothing. No Mother's Day message, no no Mother's&nbsp;
Day messages, no drawings, um no um just nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:05.760
Just completely cut off. I wasn't even allowed to&nbsp;
mail a gift to their house for their birthdays.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:14.240
um still have no idea what it is that they&nbsp;
have been told. Um but I am not mentally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:22.400
ill. Dissociative disorder is a mechanism for&nbsp;
survival. It's not a mental illness. Um and I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:33.760
angry. I am incredibly angry. But this time, as&nbsp;
excruciating as it has been, has afforded me to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:43.040
apply the strategy that I've gotten from the Lord.&nbsp;
Um, and it's taken a lot of faith and a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:53.680
patience. Not to show all my cards right now. Um,&nbsp;
but um, I have to say, Yah is so brilliant and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:53.680 --> 00:47:03.680
is so wise. Um, and so I am just clinging to him&nbsp;
through faith that he has promised me that what he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:10.000
has been leading me to do during this time is is&nbsp;
working. It's going to work. It is such a biblical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:18.000
thing that the enemy ins snares himself in his own&nbsp;
traps. He falls in his own pit. He's ins snared by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:26.640
his own devices, his own craftiness, and his own&nbsp;
words. Um, and so I'm just clinging in faith, um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:35.440
as I'm watching this unfold in absolute awe, um,&nbsp;
that I am going to be restored with my children.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:44.000
Um, and um, and um, everything that has been done&nbsp;
in darkness is going to be exposed and they will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:51.440
know exact they will know the truth. Um, and so&nbsp;
that's where I'm at right now pertaining to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:58.640
Your convictions are so powerful. I get chills&nbsp;
whenever I listen to you speak because you really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:04.000
do it from your heart and in such a genuine and&nbsp;
authentic way. And you actually didn't skip around&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.640
at all in my opinion. I thought everything really&nbsp;
flowed well. How you were able to explain all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:15.520
that and how it connected. And I mean just to&nbsp;
unpack some of it, you know, this is so common&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:22.960
within our community and it's so something that&nbsp;
is so shielded from the public on how a survivor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:30.160
is treated after they start to display whether&nbsp;
it's physical memories or body memories or you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:37.440
know what could be labeled as a psychosis. Um&nbsp;
which is so ridiculous that um survivors could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:42.480
be penalized for that. Of course, if you remember&nbsp;
the things that you and others have went through,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:47.440
who wouldn't go into a psychosis? Remembering&nbsp;
those things, I mean, just hearing about it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:53.520
could put somebody in a really hard mental state&nbsp;
if they they've never heard of some of these uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:59.920
types of abuses that, you know, children like you&nbsp;
had to endure and survive. horrific, you know, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:06.080
just seeing these playbooks happen over and over&nbsp;
and over again and that they happen and they do it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:13.280
in such a strategic way where you hear your story&nbsp;
and you see how you're going through life thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:18.240
that that the events happening, the people that&nbsp;
you're meeting that it's all organic, that there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:23.840
nothing really coincidental, that this is a path&nbsp;
that you chose for yourself, a partner that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:29.840
chose for yourself, a decision that you made for&nbsp;
yourself, and then having to realize looking back&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:36.720
that these people were 10 steps ahead of you had&nbsp;
planned a way for all of these events to occur for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:43.040
you knowing that the fate would be as soon as she&nbsp;
starts remembering. We know she's going to and as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:48.720
soon as she starts um recalling we know exactly&nbsp;
what we're going to do. We have all the pieces in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:54.000
place. We have we know what church she might go&nbsp;
to. We know what friend might might comfort her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:59.760
We know her husband is under our control. we know&nbsp;
exactly what we're going to tell the children and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:06.240
we know her uh all the resources that she has and&nbsp;
we're going to take them away. I mean, it is just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:16.080
mindblowing how strategic this Darvo is. this this&nbsp;
abuse after abuse is and how how long in advance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:23.040
they're able to sort of conduct this path to where&nbsp;
it can completely sidetrack you to where it's only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:30.080
after the fact you and so many others can say,&nbsp;
"Oh my gosh, I I see now exactly how this was all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:38.160
orchestrated, but they made it feel so organic and&nbsp;
so natural that that I was choosing all of this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.720
you know, and and it's just really horrible.&nbsp;
how we're treated, you know, you look at how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:48.400
like a military vet is treated after a war, you&nbsp;
know, and all the empathy that that society has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:53.840
for them and how of course there's flaws in that&nbsp;
system, too. You know, there's it's definitely not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:53.840 --> 00:51:00.000
a perfect healing system, but at least society&nbsp;
has empathy for that. When a soldier starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.040
sharing that they experienced a lot of really hard&nbsp;
things um while in war or while in the military,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:11.040
you know, we really accept that as oh my&nbsp;
gosh, that's so heartbreaking. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:16.960
we can't even imagine. But when a survivor comes&nbsp;
forward and and says the same types of things that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:25.120
are extremely traumatic and that can literally&nbsp;
put somebody into a a state of psychosis or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:29.840
um you know worse because of what they went&nbsp;
through. You know, it's really horrible that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:36.800
these families get away with helping orchestrate&nbsp;
sort of the perfect cover up of of the abuse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:42.400
that they incurred on the survivor. And so, right&nbsp;
from going to a psych ward to knowing, all right,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:48.720
that's on her record. The second she tries to to&nbsp;
get the kids or the second that she starts to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:53.520
you know, move away from the family and possibly&nbsp;
takes the kids, we have this right on her record&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:58.560
that we can go to the courts and use against her&nbsp;
and it's going to be in our favor and she doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:05.200
even know it, you know. And it's just so malicious&nbsp;
and so sinister how every detail is so carefully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:12.080
orchestrated and that they're literally, you know,&nbsp;
seeing years into the future and they're so scared&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:17.280
of their secrets getting out that they literally&nbsp;
have like a fail safe for every single possible&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:23.280
scenario that could possibly happen to where you&nbsp;
might share, you know, and and looking at a story&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:29.840
like yours, it's just like it leaves your jaw on&nbsp;
the floor seeing how many people were involved in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:35.840
orchestrating this and you know how in your mind&nbsp;
these were people that should have loved you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:40.640
should have cared about you, should have wanted&nbsp;
you uh to heal and and should have been there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:44.880
supporting you in your time of need. Especially&nbsp;
hearing about your husband just leaving whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:52.480
you're in despair asking him for help as a parent,&nbsp;
you know, and and hearing just the the psychotic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:58.240
nature of his response, you know, you look at&nbsp;
all of this and then them contacting a priest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:03.360
before you even get there and having that all&nbsp;
planned out in advance, you know, so you you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:08.640
you can't even go to a place like a church, which&nbsp;
should be a safe haven for survivors and get help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:14.800
And so it's just it's so devastating hearing this&nbsp;
and I am so so sorry that they targeted you this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:21.120
way and orchestrated the removal of your children&nbsp;
because you are one of the most loving amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:27.920
mothers in the whole world. And all I can say is&nbsp;
that these people picked the mom the wrong mom to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:33.520
mess with and your children picked the right mom.&nbsp;
Your children are so lucky that they have a mother&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:38.720
who's going to understand what they went through&nbsp;
whenever they get out. Um, they're so lucky that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:44.000
they have a mother who's willing to literally&nbsp;
put her life on the line to fight for them. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:49.920
they're so lucky that they have such a loving,&nbsp;
amazing mother on the other side of this who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:55.520
is going to embrace them when they too have the&nbsp;
freedom to be able to leave and to be in your arms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:01.360
again. And I just ask everybody that they pray for&nbsp;
this, that they pray over you and your family and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:06.720
your children, that not only this gets exposed,&nbsp;
but that you get reunited with your children as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:15.600
soon as possible and they can escape the way that&nbsp;
you did and not be in the the the strongholds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:24.080
evil in the spirit as well as in the physical&nbsp;
with their family. Amen. Thank you. And I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:32.640
nothing in and of myself to be able to fight this&nbsp;
entity. You know, like you like you you said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:43.280
Emma, you're right. They have the the capa the web&nbsp;
that they weave around um around people so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:52.960
they can never escape. it goes up to the highest&nbsp;
levels um of of even our justice even our justice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:52.960 --> 00:55:01.680
system. Um and and so I take I take courage in&nbsp;
the fact though they haven't picked a fight with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:10.000
me. They have picked a fight with the most high.&nbsp;
So they have already lost. Scripture is so clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:19.200
There are countless references um to this&nbsp;
kind of activity in scripture and scripture&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:27.840
and against especially those who are trying to&nbsp;
escape and repent and and come come back to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:37.760
back to faith. Yahw totally lays them waste. He&nbsp;
utterly destroys um those who will not heed his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:44.720
long-suffering and merciful warnings. And when&nbsp;
they lay these traps and these these snares um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:51.280
they are the ones that end up entrapped in them.&nbsp;
It's just we have to walk in faith. Um and as we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:59.520
do, we start to see that begin to happen. And um&nbsp;
and when we react in fear, that's sort of when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:09.200
we become reinsslaved again. um to thinking that&nbsp;
that these entities that be are are more powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:16.080
um than than the truth. And it's just it's just&nbsp;
not it's just not true. And I'm already just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:24.400
the fact that I was able to escape and stand&nbsp;
here today um and testify um and having gotten&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:31.840
through that rambling little testimony about my&nbsp;
children um without switching is a testimony to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:38.000
the glory of Yahw and his power because I&nbsp;
could not have done that the last interview&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:43.520
we did together. I couldn't even go there. I&nbsp;
couldn't even talk talked about everything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:51.520
uh but but my children um and so he is you know he&nbsp;
is bringing strength you know I found files on my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:51.520 --> 00:57:00.240
own program in the documents of one of my abusers&nbsp;
um and it included um oh I'm so tempted to say&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:09.280
the name of it uh but um it's all going to come&nbsp;
out um in a in a different in a different forum&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:16.720
um but there was there was details in in the&nbsp;
technology ology that was being used um uh that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:26.880
was being planned and some really dark stuff. And&nbsp;
so um you know Yah knows how to make sloppy joe's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:35.200
out of the Illuminati. Um he really really does&nbsp;
because you know as scripture says the fear of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:41.440
Yahw is the beginning of wisdom. unless you fear&nbsp;
him, you're not, you know, going to have that kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:49.680
of you're not going to have wisdom. And so, so I&nbsp;
made some discoveries that with his help that were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:56.640
just far bigger than I ever could have imagined.&nbsp;
And so I'm I'm working on building my testimony&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:56.640 --> 00:58:05.920
um with details um outside of the eyes of the&nbsp;
Roman mob as we're calling it uh to be released at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:12.560
the right time and in the future when the impact&nbsp;
will be big enough due to the inclusions uh and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:24.000
the completeness of it. Um I we we um withdrew&nbsp;
our podcast uh on the main platform for the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:32.560
being. It um because of threats being made to the&nbsp;
family that was supporting me from my family of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:41.600
origin from the cult. There was just some nasty&nbsp;
threats. Um and I don't believe any of them would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:50.560
prosper. Um, but you know, I began to see that&nbsp;
as things came into light and I was as I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:56.800
collecting evidence and as memories were returning&nbsp;
that this is way bigger than just me. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:04.160
and so it's actually good to uh embrace I think&nbsp;
a season of hiddenness for the time being. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:10.480
but I do encourage uh people to subscribe to&nbsp;
us at the Quickening Project um on YouTube. We&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:17.200
are on Spotify at least for the music for now&nbsp;
and then for the eventual I pray Yahw willing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:24.000
restoration of of the podcast because we are&nbsp;
we are called to obedience to Yahw even against&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:30.240
threats and intimidation from the enemy and to&nbsp;
proclaim the truth like a city on the hill. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:38.400
um and so we're just in a season regarding the&nbsp;
podcast of of recalibration. Um, and so when it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:44.400
eventually released, the fullness of my testimony,&nbsp;
affidavit, book, and more, and other interviews&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:51.600
I'm doing on platforms, just alone uh by myself&nbsp;
cuz I have personally nothing to lose now. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:51.600 --> 01:00:00.000
this will then totally expose the camp of the&nbsp;
enemy. um they'll be um I I pray brought to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:07.840
their knees so that they can be granted repentance&nbsp;
and forgiveness and ultimately salvation. But you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:13.680
know a big shock is coming and you know I've done&nbsp;
my best to warn those in the cult many of which&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:20.000
as I have said were family friends that I love&nbsp;
to repent and seek the truth so they can be on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:26.960
the right side of this exposure when it comes. Um&nbsp;
but nobody will venture into the light and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:35.600
in instead continue to choose to cast shadows on&nbsp;
their works in both denial and malicious intent&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:41.520
to continue their campaign of slander and threats&nbsp;
and vile actions against me against those who have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:50.480
helped me when I was left destitute and by effect&nbsp;
uh my children. Um and so um but I do encourage&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:56.960
you to come and enjoy the music. It's been such a&nbsp;
healing mechanism. Um, we've been writing writing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:05.840
music and and producing it in in 444 hertz, which&nbsp;
is just a really powerful healing frequency. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:14.080
that is believed to be the key of David. Um, and&nbsp;
so, um, yeah, you know, there's so much I want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:22.400
say. I'm chomping at the bit, but I'm I'm learning&nbsp;
to grow in patience and and restraint a and wisdom&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:31.760
and to to not um um yeah, I think there's some&nbsp;
things right now that have come to light that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:37.120
are better built in secret to avoid, you know,&nbsp;
the hassle because I know you haven't received&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:44.960
any threats from my, you know, ex family, um&nbsp;
but other podcasters and interviewers that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:53.360
um I have um been on have received threats of&nbsp;
lawsuits and and things like that. It's all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:53.360 --> 01:02:00.080
just fluff. I mean, it's not going to come&nbsp;
to anything. Um but it's just it's just not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:07.440
worth the engagement and the harassment right&nbsp;
now. Um but eventually this disclosure will be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:17.040
nuclear and it will bring healing to me, many&nbsp;
others. I believe justice and and vindication.

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:24.000
Wow. Oh my goodness. That is amazing that you're&nbsp;
working on so much behind the scenes and that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.840
were backed into a corner. Instead of cowering,&nbsp;
you took that as a way to empower yourself. Like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:34.960
you said, you have nothing to lose now. They took&nbsp;
everything. And so the they actually put you in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:40.400
position of of power. And I really love that like&nbsp;
you can recognize those moments. I especially,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:46.400
you know, you told that um in your testimony a&nbsp;
little bit earlier about the power exchange while&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:53.840
you were at your programmer's house and seeing&nbsp;
how his reaction to you went from that of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:53.840 --> 01:03:02.080
psychopathic I own her, I control her mentality&nbsp;
to, oh my gosh, I do not have control over this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:08.880
person anymore. And I'm terrified of that. I had&nbsp;
a guest on my podcast named Carrie Alah and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:14.320
had said in one episode and it was so impactful.&nbsp;
She was like talking about how she would feel now&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:21.040
if she saw her abuser and on the streets and how&nbsp;
she would feel and she said it's like they build&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:26.240
a really [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] sharp weapon and now it's pointed&nbsp;
at them, you know. And she's like that's how I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:30.880
would feel if I walked by my abuser. I wouldn't&nbsp;
I wouldn't be scared anymore. He would be. And I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:37.120
was like, gosh, that's such a beautiful, you know,&nbsp;
sort of taking your power back moment of of being&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:44.320
empowered in those times when they want you to&nbsp;
cower and not s uh being susceptible anymore to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:50.320
the fear tactics that they have employed on you&nbsp;
your entire life. to be able to to step forward&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.920
when you should be afraid and be fearless and&nbsp;
knowing that you're putting that fear back where&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:01.920
it belongs in their eyes and in their hearts&nbsp;
and making them cower instead of it being you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:07.680
And you can really hear that in your voice, you&nbsp;
know, and now, I mean, it's it's a it's amazing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:12.320
hearing you and others speak out who are at that&nbsp;
point where they're ready because, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:18.400
hearing how you describe yourself before and how&nbsp;
they, you know, with all the years of of grooming&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:24.000
and abuse and torture and programming and where&nbsp;
they were able to get you to be in that point&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:30.160
where you were more submissive, you know, and&nbsp;
and to hear what's on the other side of taking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:36.400
that power back and in in doing that healing work&nbsp;
to where you just sound so confident and powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:41.120
today and like I can't even picture you any other&nbsp;
way. Like I know that this is the way that God&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:47.840
intended you to be and to to be able to approach&nbsp;
your life, you know, fearless and just incredibly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:57.760
courageous. That Thank you. I appreciate that.&nbsp;
It's, you know, it's it's been such a grace and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:07.200
you're totally right. like something broke when&nbsp;
I repented and pleaded for mercy and forgiveness&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:16.560
um for the perpetrator group that day after the&nbsp;
psych ward. Like I like this this looked like I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:22.880
don't know if you've ever seen the movie Homeland&nbsp;
with Carrie like one of one she's a detective. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:29.600
looked like like it was a total red string wall.&nbsp;
Like it looked it would have looked to anybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:37.040
that had seen it or even to myself to think, "Wow,&nbsp;
what what are you doing in here?" But this this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:42.640
the thing about the Holy Spirit is he he calls us&nbsp;
to do things according to his word. And sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:48.160
those things are really unconventional and they&nbsp;
look ridiculous or crazy or foolish to the eyes of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:57.040
men. I mean, Yeshua was was was driven to the edge&nbsp;
of a cliff because they were calling him crazy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:05.440
when he was preaching the message of the gospel um&nbsp;
and uh talking about, you know, the truth. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:10.720
we have to be kind of willing um to do things&nbsp;
according to the leading of his spirit. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:17.520
you're right, something broke off of me, too,&nbsp;
when I began to repent for the sins of my family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:25.280
And I saw the sh the power shift. I was now the&nbsp;
power was now with me. And I the programming was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:32.160
no longer working. The trigger words were no&nbsp;
longer working. I was no longer under control&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:39.840
of my handler or programmer. And as fear began&nbsp;
to grew in grow in them, the power of love and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:46.560
grace and mercy and a desire for justice began&nbsp;
to grow in me. And sometimes people have to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:54.080
brought often low to the brink of absolute poverty&nbsp;
of spirit and a recognition of their own depravity&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:54.080 --> 01:07:00.240
and consequences in the realm of the physical&nbsp;
in order to rescue them and snatch them from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:09.680
flames of of hellfire that that that you know our&nbsp;
sins have have incurred. Um, and so I whatever it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:16.160
is that Aba would have me do, I will do because&nbsp;
I know he will meet me with the power to do with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:25.200
that to do that. And when we fear him, we don't&nbsp;
fear fear man. Um, but but that broke down that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:31.920
broke this altar that had been in my family&nbsp;
during this process of of fasting and prayer&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:39.280
before my red string wall of sins of the cult. and&nbsp;
my and somebody in my family actually had found it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:45.840
um in the back of the walk-in closet of the room&nbsp;
that I was staying. That was kind of my my warfare&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:51.600
and and room of room of intercession at the time.&nbsp;
And asked if I was okay. And I laughed and I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:58.240
"Yes, I know this looks bad, especially after&nbsp;
just coming out of the hospital." Um I said and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:04.560
and I said, "Would you like me to tell you about&nbsp;
it?" And and this person said he said, "Sure."&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:10.560
And I said, "Well, I'm repenting for the sins of&nbsp;
our family." Um, and I I I don't have, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:17.440
the ability necessarily to repent for the sins&nbsp;
of another, but I can bring their sins before the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:27.600
throne um in an offering of repentance for um I&nbsp;
believe in in the heart of the lamb who, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:38.960
um who bore our sins and ask him to um stir up um&nbsp;
to stir up both justice and mercy. see to to end&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:47.200
this now. Even if I have to be the first one to&nbsp;
bushwack through and get cut and bruised and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:56.640
beaten, I know that that that that covenant with&nbsp;
Satan was broken during that fast and it's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:04.000
to come to full fruition at some point. I really&nbsp;
truly believe that I'm going to see eventually&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:11.600
um the rest of my family get saved. I do too. I&nbsp;
really feel that way. And I feel like right now&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:18.080
is kind of that tipping point, you know, where&nbsp;
my hope is you and others who have been speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:24.000
out will get the recognition, you know, from the&nbsp;
public as well, so they can support you in your&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.640
in your missions. Cuz historically, it's been sort&nbsp;
of the opposite. you know, you get called and gas&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.200
lit and called crazy from your family and then you&nbsp;
go to society and they they call you a conspiracy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:40.720
theorist for talking about this. And I feel like&nbsp;
we're really pushing past the hump of those days&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:46.320
as well where now people are starting to hear&nbsp;
about this more and more and it's starting to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:51.440
something that makes sense in their minds. They're&nbsp;
starting to lose faith in the same authority that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:57.120
rules over them. What a courageous woman you are.&nbsp;
You think about all these generations that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:02.880
went on in your family. All these people just even&nbsp;
in your own story, just the few people that you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:08.320
talked about just on this podcast, all those&nbsp;
people, this huge network and web of people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:14.240
and not one of them ever had the courage to do&nbsp;
what you did. And then you look generationally at&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.000
their parents and all these people's grandparents&nbsp;
and all these people's great-grandparents,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.760
all these people's children if they have them,&nbsp;
or children's children. You know, you look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:27.360
all the different generations that this spans. How&nbsp;
many people are involved in just one testimony of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:36.800
one survivor and that one person in all these&nbsp;
generations couldn't take the programming,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:45.520
couldn't comply with the control, couldn't obey&nbsp;
the evil and the the spiritual direction that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:50.160
these cults and these families try to lead&nbsp;
you into so you can carry it on to the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:56.480
generation, you know. And man, what a hero you&nbsp;
are. You know, it's it really is amazing getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:02.080
to see that you are holding so much faith and&nbsp;
that that you've come so far to where you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:09.200
carry yourself with with his word and and share&nbsp;
that with the with the world and lead with that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:16.080
in a way that that is with integrity and love and&nbsp;
compassion, you know, and and the fact that you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.560
looking for every single way to get justice, you&nbsp;
know. I hope that that this gives people hope on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.720
the other side of the screen as well, hearing&nbsp;
you, you know, and hearing your convictions and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:30.080
your positivity and your confidence, you know,&nbsp;
and I know that we're all rooting for you on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:36.080
this side of the screen and that we all are here&nbsp;
for you, you know, and and I know that whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:41.440
whatever direction God is leading you in, whatever&nbsp;
strategy he is helping you concoct is going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:47.680
just be dynamite, you know, and that's my hope as&nbsp;
well that the people involved decide to join you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:50.560
you know, ultim Ultimately, there's going to&nbsp;
be two groups of people. There's going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:55.040
the people who put their hands up and say, "All&nbsp;
right, I was caught. I want to leave. I want&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:58.400
to heal. I'm done with this. I've wanted&nbsp;
to get out forever and didn't have a way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:04.960
and now I do. And I want to be like Kadai. I want&nbsp;
to be like these other survivors who who healed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:09.760
you know." But there's also going to be the people&nbsp;
who will fight till their last breath. They'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:15.040
fight to the death to take this to the grave with&nbsp;
them and want nothing to do with the healing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:19.280
with with coming over to the other side, you know.&nbsp;
And so we'll have to reckon with that. But these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:25.600
conversations, I think, help pave the way for the&nbsp;
compassion because ultimately we we hope 100% of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:30.320
the people in these systems will want to take the&nbsp;
high road and want to repent and heal, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:35.920
and that we need to be there with open arms just&nbsp;
like how you are when that time comes when this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:41.680
big exposure does happen. um that we're receiving&nbsp;
people with love and compassion and and wanting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:47.840
wanting them to go on a healing journey, you know,&nbsp;
and not not letting the emotion of how hard these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:53.040
things are that people like you go through affect&nbsp;
us in a way that makes us violent and makes us,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:58.080
you know, very similar to the same people that&nbsp;
we're trying to expose. And you are just such a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:04.160
wonderful example of leading in a way that I wish&nbsp;
more people heard. You know, I I really feel like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:07.920
survivors are going to change the world.&nbsp;
If everybody could hear these testimonies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:14.640
there would be a renewed faith in not just&nbsp;
God, but I think just in humanity with with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:19.600
reclaiming our empathy, too, you know, and our&nbsp;
power. And uh I just want to thank you from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:23.200
bottom of my heart for demonstrating the way&nbsp;
that you do because you're just it's really&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:34.560
beautiful listening to you talk about these&nbsp;
things as hard as it is. Wow. you know, in um

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:43.520
yeah, I'm I appreciate the encouragement. Um I'm&nbsp;
you know as you're speaking I'm remembering in uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:56.480
2018 when I was um a new mother and afraid for my&nbsp;
children and and wanting uh freedom for them from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:05.680
from these generational uh just generationally&nbsp;
handed down cult activity. Um I was on my face uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:16.640
in prayer and um Yahw said to me, "Are you willing&nbsp;
um you know and I didn't understand the full scope&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:23.040
of what he of what was about to happen at this&nbsp;
time. Um but I knew I was going to lose everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:28.720
and I began to shake and tremble in fear." And so&nbsp;
I want to just mention this as as we talk about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:33.680
courage because yes, courage is so important.&nbsp;
But I shook and I trembled in in fear and I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:42.160
"Yes, yeah, I am willing, but I am terrified and I&nbsp;
need you to make me brave." Um, and so I just like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:47.840
lay on my back and I just cried in a a position&nbsp;
of just surrender with my heart up and I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:55.200
"I need you to do surgery on my heart to purge&nbsp;
me of fear of man." because I just I just knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:02.960
that I was going to for the next 7 to 8 years&nbsp;
and and possibly longer begin to hemorrhage&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:09.600
everything that was near and dear to me because of&nbsp;
my obedience and because of the task that he had&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:21.360
asked me to begin back then to bring um exposure.&nbsp;
Um and um you know it so courage is often I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:29.360
doing things scared doing it scared you know when&nbsp;
Gideon was visited by the angel of the Lord and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:36.160
told to burn down his father's altar to Baal he&nbsp;
was terrified and shaking and you know I kind you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:44.400
it's a funny passage in Judges 6-7 the angel finds&nbsp;
him in a panic attack and and says oh mighty man&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:54.160
of valor. And and that's just the spirit of of our&nbsp;
Yah of Yahwa is he's so meek and gentle and lowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:54.160 --> 01:16:00.480
and humble as awesome and mighty and powerful&nbsp;
and terrible and as fearsome as he is. He sees&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:07.680
us. We may be doing things knock need scared and&nbsp;
trembling. But when we obey faith rather than fear&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:16.160
and we take that step even if we're terrified, he&nbsp;
calls us brave. He calls us a man or a woman that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:24.880
is mighty and full of valor. And so I want to just&nbsp;
encourage that uh for anyone who is listening who&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:34.880
who who may feel weak um that um it's okay to feel&nbsp;
the fear and to choose not to obey it and walk in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:39.680
faith anyway. It doesn't mean that you are not&nbsp;
brave. It doesn't mean that you are not strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:51.520
It's it's actually the opposite. And um if if&nbsp;
you are being led to expose um an evil or wicked&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:58.800
scheme for the sake of setting captives free,&nbsp;
um you can do that by by his power and through&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:06.320
his word and and through faithful obedience&nbsp;
and coming into a covenant um with Christ uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:13.120
the way that he tells us to do it in his word.&nbsp;
It's just incredibly simple. It's not easy. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:20.880
but it is simple. And it's actually a mercy to the&nbsp;
perpetrator group to expose them. Um, it's a mercy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:27.440
not just to those that they have been harming or&nbsp;
have harmed, but it's a mercy to them as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:35.840
um even if we're angry um so that they don't carry&nbsp;
this to the grave so that Yahw may bring them low&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:41.360
that they may repent and be saved. You know, he's&nbsp;
not going to do that. He doesn't call, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:48.640
and choose everybody. Um um but there's a lot of&nbsp;
just there's a lot of people who will be exposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:56.960
and they will still refuse to to repent. Um but&nbsp;
there is no sin too grievous for uh the blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:56.960 --> 01:18:06.880
of the lamb to be able to completely wash away.&nbsp;
And so we have to be willing um to obey him um no&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:13.360
matter the cost for the sake of those we love cuz&nbsp;
a lot of our perpetrators, you know, we have, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:19.840
know, have split us, right? So we have parts that&nbsp;
really love them. Parts that may be um working&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:26.320
through unforgiveness, harboring bitterness and&nbsp;
resentment that we have to we have to with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:34.240
help um give up to him because justice is his&nbsp;
and he will repay. But we do love these people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:40.960
you know. We really do love these people. I'm&nbsp;
not out to accuse anybody. Um, I'm just walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:40.960 --> 01:18:48.560
one step at a time according to his leading. And&nbsp;
And so, um, yeah, we're going to we're going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:58.000
encounter fear. We're going to be tempted to to&nbsp;
to not um to not walk in courage because there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:05.760
going to be warfare, right? Spiritual warfare&nbsp;
um is intense. We don't fight against, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:12.720
human beings, but but powers and principalities,&nbsp;
uh, not flesh and blood. And so, we really have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:19.280
do this with the help of his word and the sword of&nbsp;
the spirit. And there's a lot of other types of um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:25.920
paths that people will take uh that will seem to&nbsp;
work for a while, but ultimately, you know, when&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:33.440
we when we get to the end the end of this road, if&nbsp;
we're counting on the methodologies of this world&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:39.840
or other other, you know, uh or the um faculties&nbsp;
of man, we're going to or the righteousness of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:45.280
ourselves, we're going to ultimately come up&nbsp;
up short. And so that's the freedom of all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:50.560
this is that we don't walk through this based on&nbsp;
our own courage or our own righteousness at all,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:56.960
but on the righteousness of him who who gives his&nbsp;
righteousness to us so that we can stand through&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:03.280
this. And and you know, we chatted a little bit&nbsp;
the last three days and I'm I'm going through it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:09.760
right now. Like you probably hear my my voice is&nbsp;
different from the last few times we have spoken.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:16.400
I have been under such uh spiritual warfare&nbsp;
leading up to just this interview uh because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:24.800
the powers and principalities are petrified.&nbsp;
And I had I had even been visited by an entity&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:34.640
uh that identified itself as Abdon um under the&nbsp;
name Abdon um uh a couple of nights ago that came&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:43.600
into where I was sleeping the minute I lay down um&nbsp;
in my bed and began to choke and strangle me and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:51.360
uh threaten me that if I threaten me not to&nbsp;
speak. Um, and so, you know, this this stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:57.360
is real. This stuff is intense. And we're going to&nbsp;
feel those dark energies. We're going to feel the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:05.360
fear. Um, and so we really really really really&nbsp;
This is why I'm so passionate about this because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:10.720
if it weren't for the word of Yah, I would not&nbsp;
have survived to the point of being alive right&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:16.160
now. And there were times I didn't want to survive&nbsp;
it, but I would have rather been dead than have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:23.840
to go through all of this. And I'm still deeply&nbsp;
deeply suffering um as I'm navigating this. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:31.440
but without his word, I would not have been able&nbsp;
to survive the spiritual warfare. I would not have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:39.200
learned the armor of of Yahw in Ephesians that&nbsp;
you reference in your opening prayer often, Emma.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:49.600
And so there's just no other way. And regarding,&nbsp;
you know, exposure, um, you know, I think about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:49.600 --> 01:21:58.960
the woman at the well who was so astonished and&nbsp;
bewildered by Christ when he visited her who he&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:06.880
was drawn towards this woman in her sinful state&nbsp;
and he appeared to her first and he just laid her&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:13.440
sins before her. the sins that all the sins that&nbsp;
she these sin this pattern of sin that she had had&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:20.640
in her life and she's simply going about her life&nbsp;
uh you know undoubtedly laden with the burden of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:25.680
her sin whether she knows it or not and and he&nbsp;
comes up to her and he unpacks her sin before&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:32.720
her without even an introduction in just the most&nbsp;
bewildering way because our Messiah is so good and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:38.240
so loving and so merciful and he's stirred with&nbsp;
compassion and good news and he didn't approach&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:46.320
her to condemn her for it. Um but to tell her of&nbsp;
her need for the living water as she's drawing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:52.720
water from this well for his living water which is&nbsp;
his word which is themselves so that she never you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:59.120
know thirsts again. And my favorite part is how&nbsp;
she responds. She ran back to the village to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:05.440
everyone. You know what would have happened if&nbsp;
she'd been offended when Christ told her about her&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:11.760
past when he lay her sins before her? What? She&nbsp;
She could have denied it. She could have feared&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:17.360
the light shining into her darkness before. The&nbsp;
only one who could really see and know the depths&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:21.600
of her heart and her past and everything she'd&nbsp;
ever done. She could have defended herself. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:27.920
could have made excuses, tried to cover up her&nbsp;
shame. She could have been angry, offended. She&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:33.840
could have run from this only water that could&nbsp;
wash her sin and make her new. But she didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:38.720
choose to hide in shame because the savior came&nbsp;
to take it from her with his love and with his&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:46.800
holiness. And so that's the love of our savior and&nbsp;
that's how I want to be and that's how I try to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:55.200
when I am presented with conviction. Um whether&nbsp;
through somebody else or if I'm confronted by his&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:02.160
spirit or whether just through his word as I read&nbsp;
it, I want to be like her. I want I don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:08.480
reject it. I don't want to reject um reject it.&nbsp;
I don't want to fall back into the bondage of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:16.880
scrambling to atone for myself or to hide um or&nbsp;
to hide it or you know because otherwise I would&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:22.320
carry on in the slavery of my ignorance until the&nbsp;
reckoning day. And this is how I see these members&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:30.560
of of the cult that so many of us are so livid&nbsp;
with and disgusted by um but yet love at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:38.240
time because a lot of these people are family,&nbsp;
spouses, people we have grown up with. Um and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:44.800
um you know maybe I don't know why I'm sharing&nbsp;
this. Maybe maybe there is maybe a family member&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:50.800
is going to locate this interview. Maybe a member&nbsp;
of the cult. And so this may be a message held out&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:50.800 --> 01:24:57.520
to these individual that we to these individuals&nbsp;
that that we perish on the ground of our our own&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:05.120
righteousness, but by his stripes were healed. And&nbsp;
unless we try to mop it up and brush it under the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:12.960
like if we try to mop it up and brush it under the&nbsp;
rug, you know, we might be white as bleach through&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:19.680
the eyes of man, but not white as snow, not washed&nbsp;
clean, completely forgiven, emancipated as if we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:27.600
had never sinned. And I had done a lot of horrific&nbsp;
things in the cult. And um he took my shame from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:33.920
me through humility and through repentance.&nbsp;
It's it's his loving kindness that brings us&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:42.080
to repentance. And and so and so I just I hold&nbsp;
out this this spring of water welling up with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:52.800
eternal life. And for anyone listening now you&nbsp;
know where where the well is. Amen to that. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:58.800
once again, another beautiful lesson of overcoming&nbsp;
something that can be so debilitating for people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:05.840
that shame and guilt. Um, I had on my podcast one&nbsp;
time Harry Alah again, but she had said one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:13.600
ways she started reckoning with her own shame&nbsp;
was imagining some of the the abuse situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:19.760
she was forced to perpetrate in and imagining&nbsp;
a police officer standing there as a witness to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:25.440
it without the abuser knowing. And she said if if&nbsp;
that was the case and there was people there that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:30.400
could persecute, if they were looking at the&nbsp;
situation, who would they persecute? the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:36.560
child, the the young person that's forced by the&nbsp;
hand of an adult to commit a crime or the adult&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:42.000
forcing the child. And she's like, obviously&nbsp;
they they wouldn't go send a child to jail if&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:48.160
they saw an adult coercing them, whether through&nbsp;
mind control or physically with their own hands,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:53.680
you know, to per to perpetrate. You know, I think&nbsp;
that's a really important part of this journey is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:53.680 --> 01:27:00.160
being able to look at that through different eyes.&nbsp;
you know, I can't even imagine the heaviness of of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:04.800
having to even look at it at all, you know,&nbsp;
much less the feelings and emotions that it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:11.040
must bring up. But it's it's really important&nbsp;
I think that you know we cross that that line&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:15.600
at some point you know and and try to let that&nbsp;
go too and and put that shame and guilt where&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:21.440
it belongs because you know without the mind&nbsp;
control without manipulation without grooming&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:27.120
without this generational abuse happening&nbsp;
if all of that didn't exist in the family&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:33.440
nobody would have ever been put in a position to&nbsp;
begin with that would involve perpetration. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:38.080
it's wonderful once again and hopefully that gives&nbsp;
people hope on the other side of the screen who&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:43.840
are carrying that, you know, that now might be&nbsp;
the time to let that go and to really look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:48.320
it through a different lens as emotional and&nbsp;
painful as those moments can be. to be able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:53.840
see it through different eyes and to see it in a&nbsp;
way that helps represent you in your good heart,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:53.840 --> 01:28:01.120
you know, and putting that back to where to where&nbsp;
it belongs. And to to really understand that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:08.800
coercion, manipulation, mind control, um amnesia&nbsp;
to what you're doing, drugging, that those things,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.280
you know, aren't something that that you should&nbsp;
be carrying guilt for. you should be pointing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:18.560
the finger at somebody and saying, "Why the heck&nbsp;
would you do that to a young person, to a child,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.960
you know, and put them in those positions and give&nbsp;
them those things and do those things to them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:27.360
you know. So, it's really wonderful to see that&nbsp;
you've come so far in your healing journey to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:32.480
be able to breathe more free and to get to take&nbsp;
that weight off of you, you know, and to throw it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.040
off because you can tell in your voice you sound&nbsp;
very light and more at peace, you know, and even&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:41.920
though there may still be work to do, there might&nbsp;
still be a whole lifetime of work to do, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:47.440
being able to take some of that weight off even if&nbsp;
it doesn't fix every single little thing can just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:52.480
be so tremendously important in in a journey of&nbsp;
healing when there's so many different boulders on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:52.480 --> 01:29:02.000
that somebody wears and carries every day. I pray&nbsp;
so you know his yoke is easy and his burden is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:08.720
light. He says, "Come to me all who are weary and&nbsp;
heavy laden and I will give you rest. I am I am&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:14.880
gentle and lowly." And and that's how he describes&nbsp;
himself and that's how he is for those who will&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:24.880
come in humility and in need. uh for those who who&nbsp;
will who firmly remain in rebellion and defiance&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:34.560
um are going to meet are going to meet uh the side&nbsp;
that is to be greatly greatly feared. Um and so I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:44.400
yeah I pray you know um yeah I pray so I think&nbsp;
about you know I'm thinking about my oldest and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:52.960
and um I'm thinking about you know we see things&nbsp;
in our children sometimes we see generational&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:52.960 --> 01:30:00.080
patterns being passed down despite our best&nbsp;
efforts that can be sometimes concerning or or&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:06.640
sometimes frustrating and we think I don't want&nbsp;
you to have to suffer this in this way the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:17.760
that I did. And I and I remember um I had taken&nbsp;
my children to the museum in Lynen, Washington&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:27.520
um which is a tremendous occult town and um u they&nbsp;
but they love the museum there and I just thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:32.800
it might be an interesting educational experience.&nbsp;
I had just taken them out of school to homeschool.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:41.360
And this was right before I was um ostracized&nbsp;
and and marooned by my family. They they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:48.400
so scared of my coming to a knowledge of the truth&nbsp;
and my growing independence that they had to they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:53.120
had to put in place that protective order just to&nbsp;
keep me away. The grounds of the protective order&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:59.680
were ridiculous. There there there were no there&nbsp;
were no proper grounds. my my faith and and my&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:05.920
delusions because I'm very open and I talk about&nbsp;
spiritual warfare and I do operate in in prophetic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:12.160
gifts. They were so terrified they had to have a&nbsp;
protective order just to keep me from just to keep&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:18.880
me away, just to keep away the light and figure&nbsp;
out what the heck they were going to do. That that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:23.200
was what it was for. I mean, I'm not violent. I'm&nbsp;
not going to hurt them. Um but they just couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:27.520
bear to have me around and they knew that they&nbsp;
had lost. Otherwise, they wouldn't have done this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:33.760
so they could continue to have access to me, to&nbsp;
continue to exert control, to continue to keep me&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:38.960
under their thumb, but they knew they had lost. So&nbsp;
they had to they had to get me just get me as far&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:46.400
away as possible. And so I say hallelujah to that,&nbsp;
but um I suppose that was a bit of a rabbit trail,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:52.960
but I I was at the museum with my children and&nbsp;
we came across a a Freemason exhibit about the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:59.120
Freemasons in town. Um, and they had their creepy,&nbsp;
you know, all the creepy, it was, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:59.120 --> 01:32:04.160
it was w mannequins with faces, too. You know,&nbsp;
those old mannequins with faces wearing the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:10.560
Freemason aprons and the table with the Holy Bible&nbsp;
and the dagger and some of the ritualistic items&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:16.640
that the Masons use. And my youngest said, "Oh,&nbsp;
mom, look over here." He said, "What is this?" And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:22.160
I said, "Oh." I said, "Yeah." He said, "Oh, it's&nbsp;
creepy." And I said, "You're right. It is creepy."&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:30.640
And so I I I gave him a very simple answer.&nbsp;
I said um you know there there are people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:36.080
uh who Yeah. Well, I said I pointed out the Bible&nbsp;
first. I said, "Yeah, you see the Bible with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:36.080 --> 01:32:43.040
dagger on it." And and he said, "Yeah, what's that&nbsp;
about?" And you know, he was eight at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:47.920
Um he had just turned eight. And I said, "Well,&nbsp;
there there are a lot of people in in the world&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:57.280
who use the Bible." um and pretend to be, you&nbsp;
know, they profess to be Christians. They say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:03.120
that they believe in God and they believe a lot&nbsp;
of the things that are in the Bible, but they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:11.840
actually use it for secret um and bad purposes.&nbsp;
And I just gave him a super simple explanation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:17.600
And my oldest son didn't even want to look at&nbsp;
the exhibit. He just wanted to keep walking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:30.880
Um and um we were in the car after and he he was&nbsp;
really quiet. Um and he's he he he brought it up&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:40.240
um the the Masonic exhibit and and he said, "Mom,"&nbsp;
he said, "we have to tell them. We have to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:50.720
them." And I just I couldn't even speak for for&nbsp;
a moment. And eventually as we're driving home,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:50.720 --> 01:34:02.400
this conversation's taking place. And I I just&nbsp;
said, "We will. We will." And so, um, on some&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:11.360
level, my children know, um, they know. They know&nbsp;
the truth no matter what they've been told. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:21.680
I I know that I have done my best despite my dis&nbsp;
own dysfunction, despite my own guilt that has&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:33.120
been absolved, despite um my own um inability that&nbsp;
I have done my best to teach and train my children&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:40.640
in the faith so that they will have, you know, in&nbsp;
order to prepare them essentially for my eventual&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:47.440
departure, you know, which of course has been this&nbsp;
past year. And so I I do take comfort and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:57.840
helps me on those grievous nights not to fall into&nbsp;
despair and remember that I that as long as you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:06.640
know I continue to operate in faith um they will&nbsp;
be protected and that part of an the inheritance&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:17.280
um of a child of Yah is um you know restoration&nbsp;
is a blessing ing upon all the generations uh that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:23.040
will follow. And so that's why it's really&nbsp;
important for us as as mothers or or maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:32.400
fathers in some cases to to be willing to be the&nbsp;
first one to say it stops here. It stops with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:39.440
Um and that will have a trickle down effect upon&nbsp;
our children as well. He will bless them. And so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:46.880
I have full and total confidence as painful as it&nbsp;
is and as much as I miss them every single day um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:56.160
that that is there's going to be such a a mighty&nbsp;
reunion um at the right time and so I look forward&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:03.280
to that. We all look forward to that. And for&nbsp;
people listening, is there anything at all that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:10.160
people can do to support you? I know you haven't&nbsp;
gone public with all of this yet. Um, I know that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:16.320
um, there's still a level of anonymity that you&nbsp;
are keeping to protect yourself at the moment,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:20.880
even though I know that that that'll change soon.&nbsp;
Um, but is there anything that that people can do&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:26.320
to support you in your quest to get your children?&nbsp;
If there's anybody listening that could have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:34.560
resource or anything. Thank you for asking. Um,&nbsp;
I appreciate it. at this moment in time. Uh the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:42.320
the best way you could bless me would be to come&nbsp;
and enjoy um the music that um I've been writing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:52.400
and producing uh with two others. Um and um you&nbsp;
know if you are moved uh to extend a hand of help,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:52.400 --> 01:37:01.200
you you can contact me uh on Instagram at&nbsp;
thequickening or um the quickening project.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:08.560
Um I I don't you know I don't ask for money.&nbsp;
I don't ask for anything like that. But after&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:15.040
the last interview, somebody uh one or two people&nbsp;
did reach out to ask if I had a GoFundMe that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:23.120
might be able to help support the cost of living&nbsp;
um you know pay for any medical bills um potential&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:29.440
legal legal fees and that sort of thing. And so I&nbsp;
do have a GoFundMe page. You could even probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:37.840
Google it. Kadaya GoFundMe if you're moved. Um&nbsp;
I would just be incredibly blessed. Um but you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:48.960
know I I really don't I don't like you know asking&nbsp;
for money. Um, at this point I I am um I am um you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:58.080
know I'm not lacking in my basic needs that he Aba&nbsp;
is providing for me um every day um you know and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:04.960
so I'm just kind of learning to trust um that he&nbsp;
is my provider and he has been doing that through&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:10.720
just the kindness and the generosity of others. Um&nbsp;
there's just a lot of there's a lot of darkness in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:18.560
the world, but there's a lot of goodness, too. Um&nbsp;
so yeah, thanks. I appreciate that. Um you could&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:18.560 --> 01:38:29.680
pray um you could pray for continued um strength,&nbsp;
wisdom, uh provision. Um I you know you know it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:37.280
interesting with the divorce the when my husband&nbsp;
had said and I went through the conversation this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:44.640
conversation in the last interview that he was&nbsp;
filing for divorce and uh then basically just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:49.600
hung up the phone and I wanted to ask if there was&nbsp;
a gun to his head. Turned out not to be a divorce&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:56.480
protective order. Divorce papers still a year&nbsp;
later have not come and I would happily sign them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:07.840
believe me. Um and I and um and so um um this is&nbsp;
I believe for the reason of simply not wanting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:15.920
divide up our assets to continue to make sure that&nbsp;
I lack um but you know my you know thanks be to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:15.920 --> 01:39:23.680
Yah um you know as he says if he's our shepherd&nbsp;
we lack nothing and um so that turned out to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:30.400
true but that's kind of a there there I'm kind of&nbsp;
in a no man's land regarding that. And um I can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:35.920
go into some of the reasons why I'm making the&nbsp;
the the decisions legally that I'm making right&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:42.640
now. It's all going to be explained um later&nbsp;
as certain things are established. Um some of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:49.120
these things will seem foolish to the world and&nbsp;
and the ways of man. But I have a strategy that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:56.960
I've been given to from from the kingdom of heaven&nbsp;
um that I have to faithfully walk out and follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:03.200
um until I see it come to full fruition. And and&nbsp;
so far it's going really well, exactly as Yahw&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:10.720
had said that it would. And that really moves me&nbsp;
too that people went out of their way to ask you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:14.800
because we didn't talk about that last time. So,&nbsp;
I'm really grateful that I asked today and and I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:21.360
really happy that you put together a GoFundMe and&nbsp;
that you have music that people can support um in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:26.560
these different ways that you know people can jump&nbsp;
on your journey and help you grow whether it is as&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:34.160
an artist or in your pursuit of justice. You know,&nbsp;
many of us hate asking for money or for help. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:40.640
what I've come to realize is so many people have&nbsp;
more than they need and want. They feel good about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:46.960
giving and but they're stuck with nonprofits.&nbsp;
They're stuck with uh you know political campaigns&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:52.000
like so many people are putting money places&nbsp;
because it makes them feel good and it's a genuine&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:57.840
I want to help in some way. I I work I have kids.&nbsp;
I can't quit everything and jump on board but I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:57.840 --> 01:41:03.440
have $5. I have $100. I have a few thousand.&nbsp;
I have a job or an opportunity or I can hire&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:09.200
them or I need their services and can pay them for&nbsp;
it. You know, there's so many different ways that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:14.880
people just genuinely feel helpless and want to&nbsp;
help. And I don't think there's any shame at all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:21.920
in being being somebody who can receive that, you&nbsp;
know, because we want you to continue your pursuit&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:26.800
of justice. We want all if you have to go to&nbsp;
court and fight, we want you to have every single&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:32.000
penny that you possibly need so finances aren't&nbsp;
something that stops you. We want you to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:38.160
support so you have a community that that you can&nbsp;
lean on. We want you to have podcasts that you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:43.520
go on and be able to share that aren't going to&nbsp;
ostracize you or diminish your story in some way.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:48.080
You know, we want people to support your music so&nbsp;
you can eventually, if you're not already getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:53.440
paid for that, you know, make that into something&nbsp;
that can also be a way for you to provide for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:58.800
yourself. You know, so many survivors are in a&nbsp;
place where it can be really destabilizing to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:05.440
work a nineto-five job in a society that doesn't&nbsp;
yet understand or accept them. And especially, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:10.560
know, with with flashbacks or wherever somebody&nbsp;
is in their journey, it can be really difficult&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:16.320
to potentially face that whenever you're supposed&nbsp;
to be in a professional environment or, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:22.160
in these different environments that just they're&nbsp;
not so accepting of of somebody's pain and trauma.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:27.440
And so it's always my hope that we can create and&nbsp;
pave ways for survivors to be able to whistleblow&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:32.080
and to share their story and to seek justice and&nbsp;
to put together campaigns and to have, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:36.080
we pay people for every other job. Like what&nbsp;
is more important than advocating for children,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:41.040
for your children, for the children of the world,&nbsp;
for people in the cult to come out to educate the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:46.960
world on the evils that exist and that we can help&nbsp;
change that and make the world a better place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:51.520
shine a light on all the darkness and eradicate&nbsp;
it. that we can all come together and support&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:56.480
something good and that not all hope is lost&nbsp;
and that we can educate survivors waking up&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:02.240
so they're not harming themselves, you know, and&nbsp;
teach them about programming like we need you on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:08.640
the front lines, you know, and if people can have&nbsp;
five, 10, 15, 100, however many dollars, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:14.080
or just a social media page where they can share&nbsp;
your music and encourage people to go follow it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:20.240
you know, it it it really does so much to to help&nbsp;
this movement go forward. So you're not taken away&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:20.240 --> 01:43:25.200
from your mission and so you can pursue it with&nbsp;
all your might knowing that you know you're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:31.120
going to be stopped by something like finances or&nbsp;
you know whatever it is a resource and so I really&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:35.360
encourage people to go support you know if you&nbsp;
don't have money support her music go hit follow&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:41.440
on Spotify you know become a subscriber on YouTube&nbsp;
those little things too can really help somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:46.320
in their mission help them get visibility share it&nbsp;
on your social media page and if you feel called&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:53.040
to donate financially Um, I will have her GoFundMe&nbsp;
page 100% right in the show notes, no matter what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:58.160
platform you're on. And even if you guys can't&nbsp;
donate, um it's also free to go share that on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:02.800
your social media and you can help campaign for&nbsp;
her, you know, and and help her seek justice to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:08.640
get her children, you know, and and maybe there's&nbsp;
some people in your social media feeds who have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:12.400
some extra money and and who are really looking&nbsp;
for somewhere to put it, you know, we need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:17.280
put it in the in the pockets of survivors and&nbsp;
not into these corrupt people stealing money on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:22.080
behalf of survivors. You know, we think we're&nbsp;
doing all this good and we're really not. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:27.200
um, Kadia, thank you for sharing all of that.&nbsp;
I there's no problem at all and and and just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:30.960
offering it as a way for people to help, you know,&nbsp;
and there's obviously lots of other ways that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:37.520
people can support you, too. And I want everybody&nbsp;
to support you so you can continue this journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:45.840
Thank you. I I appreciate that. And it's it's it's&nbsp;
true. We need to support one another because fear&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:54.320
of lack and fear of scarcity is what keeps a lot&nbsp;
of people quiet. and afraid to leave uh handle the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:54.320 --> 01:45:01.200
the cult, you know, or their handlers because they&nbsp;
strategically will set it up so that you actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:10.080
don't, you know, um yeah, you they're they have&nbsp;
a handle on all the finances, right? And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:19.280
um it's tempting, right? Cuz all I had to, Emma,&nbsp;
all I had to do to get my kids and my life back&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:26.880
and access to my bank account was say, "Yep, I'm&nbsp;
mentally ill. These were delusions and these were&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:34.480
were false memories." That's all I had to say. And&nbsp;
there may be situations where where people are led&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:41.760
to act like David did when he was fleeing King&nbsp;
Saul as King Saul was trying to murder him. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:41.760 --> 01:45:49.040
uh he pretended to um he pretended to act&nbsp;
in he pretended to go insane, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:49.040 --> 01:45:56.880
or when Rahab lied to the spies in order to,&nbsp;
you know, in the book of Joshua in order to hide&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:03.600
uh and protect the mission of y, you know, Israel&nbsp;
at this time. So, so there there are times where&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:09.600
maybe Yahw will have us do these these types&nbsp;
of things. Um, so I don't want to encourage&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:15.840
people to just go out there and belligerently&nbsp;
belligerently start splashing around um the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:22.640
truth of things that they remember or things that&nbsp;
they know without a wisdom. Um, but if we can,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:29.520
you know, help, you know, collectively support&nbsp;
one another, whether it's me or another survivor,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:35.840
that will help them to say, "No, no, yeah, I&nbsp;
may lose everything. I may lose my children.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:43.440
Um, but if I stay quiet and if I don't leave the&nbsp;
cult, I can never get them out. We can't help&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:43.440 --> 01:46:50.880
them. We cannot protect our children if we stay&nbsp;
in. And so ye so the best way that we can support&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:59.360
one another really truly is um I think like&nbsp;
however yah would lead if it's, you know, I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:05.520
been incredibly blessed. For example, I'll tell&nbsp;
you just an absolute miracle um that happened. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:11.520
mentioned I had had no clothes where I was where&nbsp;
I was dropped off. I was I didn't have a car,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:18.960
not enough money um to buy the things I needed.&nbsp;
And so I prayed. I said I said, "Aba," I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:27.680
"I would love for you to supernaturally provide&nbsp;
for me a wardrobe." Um I I said, "I just you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.840
you know what I would like. You know what&nbsp;
would fit. You know what would feel good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:36.160
what would feel comfortable. You know what&nbsp;
you would find me beautiful and lovely in.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:42.640
You know what would what I could wear that would&nbsp;
dignify me. And a lot of these these parts of me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:48.400
especially the littles in my personality system&nbsp;
that have been so severely defiled, I said, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:55.360
know, what would help dignify us and help us walk&nbsp;
a little taller, a little straighter, feel good,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:55.360 --> 01:48:02.880
um feel like a person again? um and what would&nbsp;
would testify and and witness um of your goodness&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:11.280
to others as a as a child of God. And so I prayed&nbsp;
this in the winter and uh this this past month I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:19.440
have had the opportunity to stay with a with a&nbsp;
friend um just a really close beloved sister of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:31.440
mine. Um and um unbeknownst to me in since I had&nbsp;
prayed that prayer um she had begun to shop for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:41.040
me. Um and she put together an entire wardrobe of&nbsp;
beautiful natural fiber cotton and linen garments.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:50.960
Um and she brought them and and and um um they&nbsp;
just they fit like a glove. And so there's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:50.960 --> 01:48:59.520
like an example that might seem like in the&nbsp;
grand scheme of things, not a big deal. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:05.840
but just those small things can go a long way.&nbsp;
Even if you have like extra clothes or all you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:12.400
can afford to do is shop at the secondhand store.&nbsp;
Um, you can pray and ask Aba what it is you could&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:17.840
do to bless that person and he will pick out a&nbsp;
need for them that is so specific. He will reveal&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:25.360
to you a prayer uh of their heart that nobody else&nbsp;
has heard that he will use you to answer. And so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:34.320
I just wanted to give a little testimony of that.&nbsp;
That is so so amazing. And you know I I think it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:39.280
going to resonate with a lot of people who do&nbsp;
feel compelled. You know every a lot of people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.680
want to help. A lot of people want to help. They&nbsp;
just don't because they don't know what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:48.480
They don't realize that help can be so simple.&nbsp;
It can be a prayer, you know, it can be going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:55.760
to a secondhand store, you know, and hearing&nbsp;
that, I hope, is sort of directing people in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:55.760 --> 01:50:00.560
a way that can help them be creative with what&nbsp;
they can do, whether they have limited time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:05.680
limited finances. You know, we can all step up and&nbsp;
help. And we really have to get to a point where&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:13.120
we're leaving these old systems behind where it's&nbsp;
greed and ego and, you know, authority ruling and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:19.360
sort of the slavery system that we're in where,&nbsp;
you know, we are the ones that are sort of at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:24.400
disposal of the people ruling over us. And we need&nbsp;
to look at all the people in our communities and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:28.800
around us and and see how we can take care of each&nbsp;
other because they're not doing it for us, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:28.800 --> 01:50:35.280
know, and and if anything, they're they're really&nbsp;
penalizing the the people who suffer the most. You&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:39.040
know, there shouldn't be a single person in this&nbsp;
world who's homeless or who doesn't have food,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:43.440
you know, when you look at all the wealth and&nbsp;
all all the food that exists and water, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:48.400
it's an atrocity that that somebody anybody is&nbsp;
without a home or without a drink, you know, or&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:53.840
without healthcare. But unfortunately, that's the&nbsp;
world that we live in where, you know, basic needs&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:53.840 --> 01:51:00.800
are some of the most expensive and uh hard to get&nbsp;
things sometimes when you're going through a hard&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:06.800
time like what you are where you have people&nbsp;
actively keeping you from being resourced and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:11.840
financed and with the ability to get the help that&nbsp;
you need and the support that you need, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:16.240
and and the fact that you've had to navigate&nbsp;
all this yourself just blows my mind. Like I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:23.520
can't as a grown adult. I can't even put myself in&nbsp;
your shoes of thinking about contending with with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:30.400
the memory recollection with all the things in&nbsp;
internally that that you've had to go through and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:36.160
and heal through and then on the external world&nbsp;
all the things that happened to you at the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:41.520
time, you know, and being completely abandoned&nbsp;
by really any anybody or anything that could be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:47.200
of help for you, you know, and support. And so I&nbsp;
just I mean there's nobody more courageous or or&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:53.360
more strong or more willful or persistent or&nbsp;
brave than survivors, you know, and we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:56.960
so much to learn from that of how resilient we&nbsp;
all are and that we can all get through these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:02.000
hard times no matter how much we want to give up,&nbsp;
you know. And one other thing I wanted to to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.440
about regarding these topics, you had sent over&nbsp;
some photos and you had talked about, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:13.040
we we don't fight against flesh and blood, we&nbsp;
fight against powers and principalities, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:18.720
and I think some of the experiences that you have&nbsp;
sort of blend those two, you know, we can feel&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:26.080
physical symptoms from spiritual disease almost,&nbsp;
you know, which makes us believe that maybe our&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:34.240
bodies are are ill when in fact Sometimes these&nbsp;
spiritual attacks and the way that um our trauma&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:40.720
can manifest can be through our flesh and blood&nbsp;
and can make it seem physical when it's actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:47.600
an energy trying to seep through you know or a&nbsp;
spirit that is um you know inhabiting our bodies&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:53.440
or attacking us you know and so I wanted you to&nbsp;
share a little bit about that as well because I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:59.040
think a lot of people suffer with that. I think&nbsp;
a lot of um people get misdiagnosed for symptoms&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:05.920
of trauma versus actually having a disease or a&nbsp;
condition that doctors are trained to diagnose&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:11.120
people with. Um and you actually have some photos&nbsp;
here, like I said, that we can share to help&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:11.120 --> 01:53:16.480
educate people, you know, and especially survivors&nbsp;
who might be experiencing something similar to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:23.200
sort of look at health and trauma a different&nbsp;
way of how it can manifest in our bodies.

01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:29.360
Yeah. Yeah. Would you like to bring up some of&nbsp;
those photos and we can Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:37.680
Uh so so an AB reaction um for those who don't&nbsp;
know is when your trauma when you're processing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:37.680 --> 01:53:45.920
trauma and memories come to the surface to be&nbsp;
released um the body will um sometimes not always&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:53.040
um manifest in a in a visual way the type of abuse&nbsp;
that was perpetrated from the memory. Most people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:53.040 --> 01:54:00.080
will experience this is in sensations or pains,&nbsp;
distress emotionally and physically tension in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:05.440
their muscles. But there are a lot of cases&nbsp;
of AB reactions that and this is common where&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:11.040
people will even start you know bleeding from&nbsp;
a a specific orifice that was maybe raped or&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:17.920
mutilated or brutalized or a bruise will rise&nbsp;
to the surface. Um I have lots of examples of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:26.000
these but a couple of them that I have shared um&nbsp;
with you here um this one is uh puncture wounds&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:35.520
from the uh admin from um from a few different&nbsp;
things. Uh one was an extraction of adrenochrome&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:35.520 --> 01:54:41.920
um that happened to me in childhood uh up till&nbsp;
about the age of eight. You're not when I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:49.840
no longer a viable use for it. um as well as&nbsp;
injection uh sites for the administration of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:57.680
anesthesia um drugs and there's a lot of poking&nbsp;
and proddding and needling with uh electric&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:06.480
currents that go through various parts of the skin&nbsp;
and if you're dealing with a particularly unhinged&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:06.480 --> 01:55:14.560
um yeah I had very methodical programmer and I&nbsp;
also had one who was very unhinged who would like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:24.240
willy-nilly um just poke right with these needles&nbsp;
um in order to just create uh shocks and distress&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:31.360
um for conditioning certain behavioral uh&nbsp;
responses that were desired for the program. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:38.720
and so these are a couple of examples of just some&nbsp;
of the holes that came to the surface of my skin&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:47.440
um, while I was um, receiving um, some counseling&nbsp;
and and ministry um, from somebody in my support&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:54.800
system um, and I would manifest the pain,&nbsp;
yell ouch, and then the uh, the sight of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:54.800 --> 01:56:00.800
the administration of the needle in the memory was&nbsp;
brought to the surface of my skin which was quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:07.840
astonishing for onlookers. It really is. And I&nbsp;
think it's really fascinating, too. You hear over&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:15.120
and over again how when somebody figures out what&nbsp;
the lingering pain manifesting in the body is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:22.160
if they can get the memory that it's from um&nbsp;
and understand what what is bringing that to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.880
surface, what actually happened like that could&nbsp;
look to somebody else like maybe an insect bite,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:32.640
you know, or something they could label it as&nbsp;
where when you actually have the the tangible&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:39.040
memory of whatever it was that physically hurt&nbsp;
you, many times and maybe you can attest to this.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:45.040
I've heard that these reactions go away. So these&nbsp;
things that manifest once you pour acknowledgement&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:51.120
into it and heal the memory and sit with it a&nbsp;
lot of times these lingering things that could&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:56.160
maybe be diagnosed as say a chronic rash or a&nbsp;
chronic disease or something that you have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:56.160 --> 01:57:05.120
go on medication for forever, you know, they can&nbsp;
heal themselves through memory work. It's really&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:05.120 --> 01:57:11.840
remarkable. In fact, I I I believe most diseases,&nbsp;
especially chronic inflammation or chronic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:15.760
um illnesses, autoimmune disease,&nbsp;
chronic inflammation in the body,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:24.400
a lot of those are manifestations of&nbsp;
trauma. Um and they need to come up and out

01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:30.960
and I just I'll move on to the next one. Yeah,&nbsp;
that's just another example of the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:38.800
That one's a little easier to see because uh some&nbsp;
of the needles were really big, like wide gauged,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:48.160
very wide gauge needles uh that were used. Oh my&nbsp;
gosh. And it it really is like it's just it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:54.000
phenomenal to me that something like that can&nbsp;
pop up on your body out of the blue seemingly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:54.000 --> 01:58:00.960
you know, even though we know why it does. But&nbsp;
it's like h it's just amazing how strong memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:05.280
is, you know, to really just like sit with&nbsp;
that for a minute and to think how powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:12.960
our memories are that it can bring about something&nbsp;
physical on our skin like a wound, a needle wound,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:19.520
a big needle wound because we're remembering&nbsp;
something that happened in our past that our&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:24.960
past can literally show up on our body in a&nbsp;
moment. I mean, it's just incredible how how&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:30.000
behind the times we are with with this and how&nbsp;
many people could benefit from knowing this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:36.880
you know, from whether it's a trauma, a traumatic&nbsp;
event or life like what you grew up in or,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:41.760
you know, different types of trauma andor abuse or&nbsp;
medical trauma that people have gone through and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:41.760 --> 01:58:47.280
the different ways that that our medical system&nbsp;
is gaslighting and abusing people even unknowingly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:47.280 --> 01:58:51.680
that these doctors are just doing what they're&nbsp;
taught, you know, and it's just really wild.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:51.680 --> 01:58:58.240
So this is a really important you know kind&nbsp;
of slideshow that you've created for us.

01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:04.960
Uh so this this example on the screen you see a&nbsp;
burn like a burn mark on my hand. So that is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:13.040
ab reaction from an electrode burn and the size&nbsp;
of the electrode as you can see covers most of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:13.040 --> 01:59:21.520
my hand. Uh because these electrode pads, this&nbsp;
was from a memory where electrode pads um I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:28.480
really little and so the electro pads were huge.&nbsp;
You know, my hand like I was toddler age so these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:34.640
but these were like a big adult-siz electrodes&nbsp;
and so they use the hands and feet a lot and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:34.640 --> 01:59:42.000
that's why the electrode burn covers so much of&nbsp;
the hand. Um, yeah, cuz I was just so young. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:47.760
so this this Yeah, there's another picture of it.&nbsp;
The next couple of pictures are are from this AB&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:54.240
reaction. Um, so one of the things that I've one&nbsp;
of the reasons we've been writing and producing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:54.240 --> 02:00:01.920
music in 444 hertz in the key of David using the&nbsp;
word of Yah, we're um releasing actually a song&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:08.080
tonight, a new song tonight. Uh, so we get we're&nbsp;
going to um most of the song drops that we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:14.800
having these days have been on YouTube because&nbsp;
we're uploading um our first album to Spotify&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:21.520
um probably in the next couple months and then&nbsp;
the second one um is is uh forthcoming. But as&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:28.240
we were listening to this music, this is an&nbsp;
example of how powerful this frequency is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:35.680
Um, I began to get flashbacks and memories in&nbsp;
the studio uh during the production process,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:42.480
especially not just um the the singing process,&nbsp;
but the production process. And so I was in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:50.400
studio and suddenly this jolt of electric energy&nbsp;
rushes through my body and burns my skin. And I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:50.400 --> 02:01:01.840
it was so so sharp and shocking, no pun intended,&nbsp;
that I screamed, "Ow!" And then um uh I was asked&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:08.000
if I was okay and I said, "Yeah, the pain came&nbsp;
and left. It left as soon as it was gone, but it&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:15.680
came with the flashback of this memory of being uh&nbsp;
tortured with electroshock." And uh and I looked&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:15.680 --> 02:01:22.720
down and uh right where these electrode pads had&nbsp;
burned the most in my memory as I was experiencing&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:31.040
this flashback, this rash erupted to the surface.&nbsp;
And then you'll see here the last p is the same uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:40.000
event, but it had kind of begun to scab over. Oh&nbsp;
my goodness. And how long, for example, this one,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.880
I'm sure it's different for every reaction that&nbsp;
manifests physically like like these ones do that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:50.640
we're showing. How long do these typically last&nbsp;
to where you're feeling the pain or you're feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:57.520
what happened in your memory? It's completely&nbsp;
dependent based on the memory. I have had&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:04.800
memories that have come forth that have left me&nbsp;
in a crippling pain and an inability to function&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:12.480
and a lot of distress as it was coming up and&nbsp;
out um for for weeks. And then others is just a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:12.480 --> 02:02:21.120
moment. Um and it just it really kind of depends.&nbsp;
There's there's a lot more to um that I I still&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:29.440
need healing from that I can feel. um um needs to&nbsp;
come out, but that happens when we're ready for&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:37.040
it. Um otherwise, we have a psychotic break or you&nbsp;
know end up in in the psych ward or or with severe&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:46.640
amnesia in a similar way that I mentioned in the&nbsp;
last interview with that whole story. But yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:54.000
it's um it's quite fascinating and I know it&nbsp;
sounds like oh that's really nice. I I you know I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:58.160
don't want people to be afraid to go listen to the&nbsp;
music there. I'm not saying you're going to start&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:04.720
to have flashbacks and experience horrific ab&nbsp;
reactions. Um, but this has just been the process&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:04.720 --> 02:03:12.960
of of of what Yahw has been doing with me through&nbsp;
through his spirit is that when we are ready and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:22.000
we are in the process and ready for memories to&nbsp;
return and needing amnesic barriers to come down&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:28.240
by his divine hand, he will do it for he will do&nbsp;
it at a pace that we're ready for it. And so the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:35.120
music has been a really helpful uh has been really&nbsp;
helpful to me in this in this process because it&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:42.720
can be very tormenting. And as David soothed Saul&nbsp;
with his playing when he was being tormented by&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:42.720 --> 02:03:52.160
evil spirits, um we do have access uh to that same&nbsp;
kind of power. You know, it's not a magic spell.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:58.160
Um there are a lot of different frequencies,&nbsp;
but when we're walking in faith and obedience&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:05.600
and a covenant with the most high yah through&nbsp;
faith in Christ, um we can sing in the key of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:13.680
David ourselves. We can produce and tune our&nbsp;
instruments to 444 hertz and we can start to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:20.800
watch those amnesic barriers fall and that trauma&nbsp;
come to the surface so that we can work through&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:27.200
it and process through it with a with a you know&nbsp;
ideally the Holy Spirit he's our he's our good&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:27.200 --> 02:04:33.200
counselor and you know his ministry is sufficient&nbsp;
but we often have people in supporting roles&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:40.560
um not everybody is able to do that and So&nbsp;
if that's not you, it's okay. His grace um&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:40.560 --> 02:04:51.920
is sufficient. But if you Google for example um if&nbsp;
you Google put into a Google search uh um if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:51.920 --> 02:05:00.720
put into a Google search uh battles music battles&nbsp;
and music in the Bible you will get a hundred&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:10.560
different Bible verses and examples of Satan's&nbsp;
army of darkness being utterly smited smold&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:20.640
utterly destroyed just through the instruments,&nbsp;
just through the worship, the tambourines or&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:28.080
the singing or the the music, the worship and the&nbsp;
praise of the people of Yah, the people of Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:33.760
In fact, you'll see examples where he actually&nbsp;
sends to the very front lines of the battle,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:38.960
the scariest place to be, where you face the&nbsp;
most onslaught, the most resistance. He senses&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:48.480
musicians up front. That is the kind of power&nbsp;
that we have in him to not use um carnal weapons&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:54.720
but spiritual ones. And so this has been my story&nbsp;
with the music and why I'm so eager and passionate&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:54.720 --> 02:06:01.440
to write and produce it and use his word. Um&nbsp;
and all of us here together, the three of us,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:01.440 --> 02:06:06.960
the three of us here together that are producing&nbsp;
it are experiencing a ton of healing. A ton of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:13.440
veils are being ripped. Laura Sanger, who I'm&nbsp;
sure many of your listeners may or may not&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:13.440 --> 02:06:19.600
have heard of, who wrote No Longer Enslaved, she&nbsp;
talks a lot about the power of frequency and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:19.600 --> 02:06:26.320
of praise and and of worship um in Healing. And&nbsp;
unfortunately, a lot of Christian music out there&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:26.320 --> 02:06:35.360
has been intentionally twisted by the deceiver&nbsp;
to be in the wrong frequency or to include um&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:43.680
a false or a twisted doctrine um to actually keep&nbsp;
veils in place. Many Christian songs are used in&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:49.600
programming and that was the case for me. And so&nbsp;
um that's just something to pray for discernment&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:49.600 --> 02:06:56.160
about. and your music, like how she said, it's on&nbsp;
YouTube, it's on Spotify, so you guys can connect&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:56.160 --> 02:07:04.240
with her. Um, and I encourage you guys, too. I&nbsp;
mean, especially if you're a survivor and you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:09.920
wanting to heal, music is something that that&nbsp;
helps calm you or that that you love. I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:15.040
on some level music is so incredibly healing for&nbsp;
all of us or at least we think it is, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:15.040 --> 02:07:20.080
and it's really terrible how they have tampered&nbsp;
with the frequencies over time and how our music&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:20.080 --> 02:07:28.240
is it might feel consciously like it feels good,&nbsp;
you know, but internally it's it's sort of going&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:34.000
into our body in a way that acts as a toxin and&nbsp;
we might not even know it. And so I love that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:39.920
you're helping us detox with music that is in the&nbsp;
right key and is in the right note and frequency,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:44.960
you know, because that is so healing. We hear&nbsp;
all the time about people buying these different&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:44.960 --> 02:07:50.800
frequency machines just to keep in their home&nbsp;
to elevate the frequency of the of their home&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:55.840
and their environment right directly, you&nbsp;
know, around them and encompassing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:55.840 --> 02:08:00.240
And I think that it's it's just something really&nbsp;
important to think about that we don't, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:06.160
and we're s we're always surrounded by Wi-Fi and&nbsp;
these, you know, 5G and these frequencies that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:11.840
want to harm us. So, one of the best ways to help&nbsp;
combat that is by, you know, doing the opposite,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:17.120
putting on a frequency, having frequency around&nbsp;
you, listening to high frequency music that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:24.080
is detoxing the the harmful effects of all the&nbsp;
different negative frequencies that are around&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:28.880
us. And I really love that you, you know, I'm&nbsp;
really surprised that more people aren't doing&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:32.880
what you're doing, but I really think it it was&nbsp;
meant for you to do so you could bring that to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:38.720
the forefront. I couldn't think of a better person&nbsp;
to help introduce this concept than you, you know?&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:45.040
But whenever you learn about this frequency and&nbsp;
you learn about how toxic so much of our music is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:50.960
it just makes you question like how how are&nbsp;
more people not defying that? Like everybody's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:56.800
defying all these other aspects of society.&nbsp;
chemtrails and pesticides and GMOs, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:03.280
but when it comes to something that affects us on&nbsp;
a cellular level 24 hours a day like frequency,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:03.280 --> 02:09:07.840
you know, we're we're not fighting for that, you&nbsp;
know, as hard. And so, I love that you're coming&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:12.080
into that conversation with a solution, you&nbsp;
know, and one that that fights with love and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:16.080
compassion and and, you know, sort of gets gets&nbsp;
us on the right track. It's really amazing. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:21.200
I do encourage people to go follow your work, you&nbsp;
know, especially hearing what you went through and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:29.360
seeing these photos, actual visuals of ways&nbsp;
that energies were negatively impacting you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:29.360 --> 02:09:35.920
you know, and realizing the the strength that we&nbsp;
can fight that with with something like music.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:41.680
Amen. Yes. It's been been huge. I was I was in&nbsp;
a state of absolute despair because this is such&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:47.600
an overwhelming process to go through healing&nbsp;
discovering that you have a dissociative disorder&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:52.640
or have multiple personalities and then you're&nbsp;
trying to escape the cult and then you're in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:57.360
safe place and they're still pursuing your life&nbsp;
and it it's just absolutely overwhelming to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:03.600
to navigate through. And so I was pleading with&nbsp;
with Yah um with my sister who produces writes&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:09.520
and produces the music with me what there's got to&nbsp;
be a key. There's got to be a key. You say in your&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:09.520 --> 02:10:15.280
word, to you I give the secrets of the kingdom if&nbsp;
you're walking in righteousness and faith. And he&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:15.280 --> 02:10:23.440
said immediately, he said, it's the key of David.&nbsp;
And uh so we just poured ourselves into the music&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:32.000
as a first priority. And it's just also just been&nbsp;
so much fun. I love that. And I think it's just so&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:36.320
creative that you thought outside of the box, even&nbsp;
right down to the words that you use, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:40.800
and using non-triggering words. Um, I think&nbsp;
that this will keep growing in our community,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:45.200
especially Oops, I just skipped the wrong one.&nbsp;
Um, it'll keep growing in our community and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:45.200 --> 02:10:51.520
and become a need that people see more and more&nbsp;
that that can be healing for them. So, I'm really&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:55.680
proud of you and really excited to watch your&nbsp;
journey with this music unfold. And like I said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:55.680 --> 02:11:00.720
I'll have all of that in the show notes for you&nbsp;
guys. And hopefully some of you feel validation&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:04.880
too seeing these different photos. And I'll have&nbsp;
you share about this one too, but I know a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:10.160
of survivors go through these AB reactions and&nbsp;
and have a lot of different health issues that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:10.160 --> 02:11:15.680
can probably be very easy to be dismissed or&nbsp;
misdiagnosed. So, um I'm really happy that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:15.680 --> 02:11:23.120
we're able to see that your documentation of of&nbsp;
your own uh reactions so we can actually sort of,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:27.680
you know, understand something that we're never&nbsp;
taught about trauma and how it can manifest.

02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:42.480
Yeah, thank you. This is a video here um as you&nbsp;
can see of an AB reaction while uh processing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:52.160
remembering um electroshock therapy. This&nbsp;
is something that happens really commonly&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:52.160 --> 02:12:01.280
um not just on the shoulder but on my legs and&nbsp;
any area of my body where any electrode was put&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:12.000
uh you'll see this type of manifestation. And so&nbsp;
this will happen often um during a flashback or&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:22.000
um after you know a deep session of of&nbsp;
ministering prayer. Oh my gosh. I have heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:27.520
of a lot of people who say that they get, you&nbsp;
know, what they think are like muscle spasms or&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:34.400
um twitches, you know, and um it's really helpful&nbsp;
to be able to potentially pair a memory with that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:40.320
and and or to sort of think outside the box of&nbsp;
maybe it's not that you're low on electrolytes&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:44.800
or you need to eat something with potassium&nbsp;
in it. That this is your body remembering&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:49.280
something and trying to share it with you,&nbsp;
you know. And that's amazing that you were&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:53.520
able to capture that because I'm sure it can&nbsp;
be sort of hard in those moments too to kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:59.760
of grab a camera or something and record it&nbsp;
as it's happening if it's fleeting. Yeah.

02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:14.400
So this is uh called palm planter pular psoriasis&nbsp;
and I developed this in 2018. Uh when I uh began&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:21.600
to defy my programming and the cult in my pursuit&nbsp;
of truth through the word of yah. Uh there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:29.920
all kinds of programming implemented to inflict&nbsp;
the body. Um it's done very physically but also&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:38.080
uh through um spirits that come in um and parts&nbsp;
that are activated that have the spiritual power&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:45.040
from these demons in order to inflict this kind&nbsp;
of horror. And so I developed this psoriasis&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:45.040 --> 02:13:52.000
um on my hand, my arms, mostly my legs, and the&nbsp;
bottoms of my feet, which was the worst because&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:59.360
it really impaired my ability to walk when it&nbsp;
was really bad. Um and so that's what this is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:07.120
And then um I think hopefully it's the next&nbsp;
video you'll see a miracle of healing. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:15.440
of course I had to show off my garden. Um because&nbsp;
there's just hope. There's just so much hope in&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:21.920
the garden. A scripture starts and ends in the&nbsp;
garden. Um and you'll see there is no psoriasis&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:30.080
whatsoever. It completely heed healed up through&nbsp;
the laying on of hands when I was rescued to a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:38.320
place of refuge. Um a after I escaped the cult and&nbsp;
I talk talked about that in the last interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:46.240
uh my psoriasis disappeared. Um and so that was&nbsp;
just an absolute miracle um that was administered&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:51.360
through the body of of Christ through the laying&nbsp;
on of hands. And when your body is in a safe&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:51.360 --> 02:14:58.960
place and it starts to decompress and trauma can&nbsp;
start to come out and come forth, sometimes you'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:04.160
go through what's known as a healing crisis and&nbsp;
things might kind of flare up and get worse before&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:04.160 --> 02:15:10.800
they get better. It's it's like a detox, right?&nbsp;
And so, uh, that was a total miracle just to watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:17.440
that basically evaporate before our eyes, um, in&nbsp;
the weeks following that laying on of hands and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:24.320
that prayer and that just oh, the the horror of&nbsp;
realizing everything that had gone on and that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:30.640
still going on, but yet the safety of knowing that&nbsp;
I'm in a place of refuge and that this now can be&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:38.480
a season of healing. Um and uh yeah, you know, the&nbsp;
seeing just seeing the garden the garden there,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:44.080
you know, I think a lot of survivors and I&nbsp;
encourage this um have found a lot of therapy a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:44.080 --> 02:15:50.800
therapeutic benefits um in keeping and maintaining&nbsp;
a garden. And so I had the opportunity to start a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:58.480
start a garden from from scratch from a patch of&nbsp;
dirt and just sew in hope as just a a prayer and a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:05.360
prophecy of just the harvest that comes forth. um&nbsp;
when we are faithful and we walk in truth and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:11.920
when we do the right thing um the the labor of our&nbsp;
hands and the labor of our hearts will not return&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:21.040
void. It really will not. And so this is just an&nbsp;
encouragement um for anyone out there. Oh my gosh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:26.880
I love the garden and I love seeing your healed&nbsp;
skin, you know, and and the way that God worked&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:31.680
miracles on you and you and yourself or having&nbsp;
the courage to pursue healing, you know, and to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:37.840
not just sort of slap on a diagnosis on yourself&nbsp;
and treat it with, you know, western medicine, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:37.840 --> 02:16:43.760
actually do the inner work to identify what the&nbsp;
root cause of it was. Would you have any advice&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:52.880
for survivors who may be in different levels of&nbsp;
healing and memory recall but might be questioning&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:58.000
if something that they're experiencing healthwise&nbsp;
is a memory or if it's something that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:04.880
actually need to go get help for? Do you have any&nbsp;
tips on how they might be able to tap into that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:10.080
and and see? You mentioned a safe environment. I&nbsp;
feel like that's a really good a good tip. Do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:17.359
have any other ways that could maybe be helpful?&nbsp;
Recognizing patterns of when symptoms are flaring&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:17.359 --> 02:17:24.479
up and trying to pay attention and documenting&nbsp;
those can help. Um, for example, I noticed a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:24.479 --> 02:17:32.879
an alleviation of very specific symptoms when I&nbsp;
was not around certain people. And as I began to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:42.160
go through uh as parts in my my system um which&nbsp;
I sometimes call a bus and sometimes call Ktown&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:42.160 --> 02:17:51.519
that was affect affectionately named um um by&nbsp;
someone I love very dearly. Um um when when&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:51.520 --> 02:17:58.080
members of Ktown began to come forward and and&nbsp;
make confessions, it it became evident that a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:03.840
lot of these symptoms were attached to specific&nbsp;
being around specific abusers. And because those&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:10.560
amnesic barriers were high, I just thought I had&nbsp;
had a bunch of mysterious illnesses or whatever,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:19.520
you know, Lyme disease, bartinella, mcass, uh&nbsp;
histamine. Um, histamine uh is a real big trend&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:26.000
right now. Histamine intoleranced or mass cell&nbsp;
activation syndrome. Histamine is actually used&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:32.640
and studied in programming and you can research&nbsp;
this very easily on the n you know NIH website.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:40.479
um histamine and memory are very closely connected&nbsp;
and so it's been very widely studied um how uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:40.479 --> 02:18:49.679
blocking uh and interfering with certain histamine&nbsp;
receptors actually um inhibits or increases memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:49.680 --> 02:18:56.479
recall facial recognition um and different&nbsp;
things like that and so um I I don't want to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:56.479 --> 02:19:03.040
stand here and say everything um is is related&nbsp;
to programming and everything is related to to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:09.439
trauma, but it is my belief that the majority&nbsp;
of illnesses and symptoms that are out there are&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:09.439 --> 02:19:17.919
rooted spiritually are rooted in trauma. And so I&nbsp;
think that you can't go wrong in at least praying&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:27.120
about it and exploring that as a possibility. Um&nbsp;
and um and just through prayer. A lot of this for&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:27.120 --> 02:19:35.280
me had to be had to I came into awareness just&nbsp;
from from the counsel um that comes from the one&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:44.240
who can see where I cannot where doctors cannot&nbsp;
you know he has you know yeah one of our songs&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:52.080
um that we posted um entitled the quickening um&nbsp;
goes you know is a petition and a prayer to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:58.479
seven spirits of God uh the seven spirits of&nbsp;
Yahw which are spirits, the spirit of counsel,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:58.479 --> 02:20:07.359
wisdom, understanding, uh, knowledge, might, his&nbsp;
spirit, and then also the fear of Yahw. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:07.359 --> 02:20:13.599
we need really his counsel. And so, I would just&nbsp;
say just pray, go to him and ask. Repentance for&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:20.880
me has been a also a part of healing, harboring&nbsp;
unforgiveness. Um there's actually secular&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:28.800
studies done um a lot of secular studies done&nbsp;
that talk about how um unforgiveness increases&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:28.800 --> 02:20:35.120
um your probability of getting cancer. Um and&nbsp;
that's because a lot of people have unforgiveness&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:41.599
also as a result of trauma. And so it's just kind&nbsp;
of a complicated web and we really we really need&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:41.600 --> 02:20:47.040
the wisdom that comes from heaven in order to&nbsp;
be able to walk through it because it's really&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:47.040 --> 02:20:53.519
overwhelming. I found navigating I have found&nbsp;
navigating illness really really overwhelming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:53.520 --> 02:20:59.280
What do you eat? What do you not eat? How do you&nbsp;
heal? What is this attributed to? And so without&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:05.840
w without praying, I wouldn't know. And some&nbsp;
things are still a bit mysterious to me. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:13.359
so just learning to tr to seek understanding from&nbsp;
him but then also trust where I don't understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:13.359 --> 02:21:22.319
yet. Um you know has been a process that I'm still&nbsp;
navigating. Um yeah so I don't know if that that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:22.319 --> 02:21:29.359
too helpful but it's very helpful. And sort of&nbsp;
along those same lines, um the last question that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:29.359 --> 02:21:36.000
I have today that I wanted to ask just about this&nbsp;
particular topic of sort of the healing stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:43.359
um ab reactions are one way that our bodies can&nbsp;
sort of start harming itself in a way through&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:43.359 --> 02:21:49.519
the energy and through the trauma. Um that's not&nbsp;
brought on by the actual survivor doing anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:49.520 --> 02:21:56.479
to their body to to um you know actually putting&nbsp;
a needle in themselves or anything. This is sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:56.479 --> 02:22:02.160
of a a really supernatural process that happens&nbsp;
through memory. But there's also the self harm&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:08.319
programming that can activate as somebody's&nbsp;
remembering. And a lot of survivors are like&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:08.319 --> 02:22:14.000
you when they wake up where they don't know what&nbsp;
did. They've never heard of mind control. And so&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:20.160
they're trying to do the right thing by getting&nbsp;
help and disclosing. And programming is triggering&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:20.160 --> 02:22:25.519
them to do the opposite. you know, instead of&nbsp;
healing, it's it's it's trying to get them to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:25.520 --> 02:22:32.720
harm themselves um in different ways. And I wanted&nbsp;
to see how you dealt with that when and if it&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:32.720 --> 02:22:39.680
happened to you. And of course, any any guidance&nbsp;
you could give people listening who may or may not&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:39.680 --> 02:22:45.680
be experiencing that. um you know, how to maybe&nbsp;
navigate that if somebody does remember or you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:53.201
know, if somebody's in the process of remembering&nbsp;
and sort of how to uh how to navigate that.

02:22:54.399 --> 02:23:00.719
Wow, that is that's a deep that's a really deep&nbsp;
one that and that was something that I really&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:09.040
struggled with um even recently um with the&nbsp;
urge to there because there are parts right&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:17.200
with with the urge to self harm and I would say&nbsp;
that underneath the surface of that is a deep&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:25.200
deep self-hatred and a deep deep self-loathing&nbsp;
and a perpetuation of the abuse abuse onto self&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:25.200 --> 02:23:33.679
because there were parts that were that I that&nbsp;
were in in my system um are even are in my system&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:40.720
that are introjections of particular handlers or&nbsp;
particular programmers or abusers that are meant&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:49.120
to inflict harm as a punishment or a consequence&nbsp;
for violating the program or for for disob&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:49.120 --> 02:23:57.040
um disob disobedience. And so what those&nbsp;
what what really needs to happen there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:57.040 --> 02:24:08.319
for those parts to come out of hiding and into&nbsp;
the light of of of their worth and their value&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:08.319 --> 02:24:17.359
um and to to basically receive just the ministry&nbsp;
of love. I believe the ministry of love and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:17.359 --> 02:24:26.000
ministry of acceptance. Um, I'm not sure that&nbsp;
those behaviors can go away though until there&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:31.600
are parts that come forward to confess the&nbsp;
reasons why they hate themselves so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:36.399
Maybe it's something that they have done in&nbsp;
the cult that they were forced to do. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:36.399 --> 02:24:43.839
don't understand perhaps how they were programmed&nbsp;
because a lot of them um have been told that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:48.800
are bad or that they are evil and did not know&nbsp;
that they weren't doing things out of their own&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:56.640
free will but they were doing things as they&nbsp;
were programmed to do. Um and so I I I tend&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:05.600
to look at self harm almost always. Um I used to&nbsp;
think it was like a like de like a just demons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:12.800
Um, and um, and you know, it's it's not I&nbsp;
think it's more complicated. There's often&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:19.600
pain and trauma from other parts that have been&nbsp;
fragmented, whether through ritual abuse or not,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:25.600
um, that are um, screaming out for help and&nbsp;
there's no other way for them to express the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:33.680
pain. I have a silent scream that is very&nbsp;
closely connected to a self harm program.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:42.160
And that silent scream is very common amongst&nbsp;
survivors who were not able to ask for help or&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:42.160 --> 02:25:50.720
when they did they were punished for it. And so um&nbsp;
giving these parts any form of expression even if&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:50.720 --> 02:25:57.120
you don't have someone who is trusted who these&nbsp;
parts can come forward and emote to or interact&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:03.920
with or receive ministry or prayer or just love&nbsp;
and affection from. Um, you can get a sketchbook,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:11.439
you can pick up a notepad, you can begin to write,&nbsp;
and you can begin to just speak into yourself and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:11.439 --> 02:26:19.679
say, "Is there any part broken part of me that is&nbsp;
in pain that that would like to talk, would like&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:19.680 --> 02:26:24.640
to talk about what happened, would like to show&nbsp;
me or just give me a word." And you can draw,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:31.200
you can write poetry, and you can just try to&nbsp;
see what comes up and allow these parts to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:39.280
forward and to receive them in love and to receive&nbsp;
them in appreciation and to to start to understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:39.280 --> 02:26:43.840
the things that are keeping them bound that&nbsp;
are keeping that part of our soul bound so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:52.640
they can receive freedom. Thank you so much for&nbsp;
that. That's to me has been weighing on my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:58.160
You see the desperation and the will of people&nbsp;
wanting to get free and then unfortunately in&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:04.639
our community, those same some of those same&nbsp;
people who make it past actually getting out,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:04.640 --> 02:27:10.160
which is such a huge step end up falling to the&nbsp;
pitfalls of self harm, you know, and and it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:10.160 --> 02:27:16.399
just so incredibly sad. And I feel like if people&nbsp;
are just aware of this, we can help support our&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:16.399 --> 02:27:21.439
friends and and family and people in our lives&nbsp;
that end up remembering um things that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:21.439 --> 02:27:27.040
went through. And then also that survivors can or&nbsp;
people that think that they might be survivors can&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:27.040 --> 02:27:32.319
be educated enough for when those times come if if&nbsp;
they think that they're a survivor or think that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:32.319 --> 02:27:37.120
they might have memory coming up, you know, that&nbsp;
they're also equipped with understanding what what&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:41.599
might happen, you know, the good, the bad, the&nbsp;
ugly, um, and sort of how to navigate that. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:46.160
I really really appreciate your perspective&nbsp;
on that. And it's, you know, what a miracle&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:51.040
that you've been over, you've been able to&nbsp;
overcome that so many times in your own journey.

02:27:53.600 --> 02:28:00.640
I'll I'll tell you a little story. I had a I thank&nbsp;
you. I I appreciate that. And and and I couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:00.640 --> 02:28:15.040
do it alone. Um I I um have I I'll say have I'm&nbsp;
not integrated. Um, and so one of one of my parts,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:25.120
um, so the selfharming part that I have dealt with&nbsp;
is is not really much of a cutter, but more of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:33.599
b like a would I would uh beat my head with my&nbsp;
fists to try to get uh, you know, something would&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:41.040
trigger it. Something would trigger this part that&nbsp;
would cause like head bashing. Um, and you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:48.560
it's it can be a confusing experience, uh, trying&nbsp;
to figure out what triggers it. Um, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:48.560 --> 02:28:55.520
a lot of I was in so much distress and torment I&nbsp;
couldn't make my brain turn off on this loop or&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:55.520 --> 02:29:02.720
something happened um that created a sense of fear&nbsp;
or self-hatred, whatever it was. This is what this&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:29:02.720 --> 02:29:13.120
part did. Um and I um had been praying and asking&nbsp;
for help regarding this um and um this this friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:23.200
of mine who um I've been living with um who by the&nbsp;
spirit brought the clothes that I had prayed for.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:30.880
um this part came forward um in front of&nbsp;
her and this part had never done that before&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:39.760
um in front of anybody that was not a handler&nbsp;
or an abuser. And um it was interesting because&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:47.520
I'm internally talking to this part that now has&nbsp;
full almost full control of the body. I'm now cast&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:29:47.520 --> 02:29:58.560
to the back me as Kadiah. And um this part um who&nbsp;
goes by the name of Zineia um I'm now speaking I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:05.439
now at the back and she's in the driver's seat and&nbsp;
she's starting to you know hit her fists against&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:05.439 --> 02:30:12.000
her head and I'm speaking into her system into&nbsp;
the system telling her that that the thing that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:18.800
triggered it um was not a big deal and it was&nbsp;
a small thing I thought and I'm trying to tell&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:26.800
her to de to to deescalate that it's okay it's&nbsp;
not a big deal and the fact that this happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:26.800 --> 02:30:34.560
in front of this friend who I had f you know grown&nbsp;
in to love and trust was it was a miracle and she&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:42.160
came over to me and she held my hands down and&nbsp;
restrained my fists from inflicting any further&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:51.280
self harm and she said the opposite of what I&nbsp;
was saying she said it That's a big deal and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:58.960
want to hear why. And this part was able to tell&nbsp;
her, okay, this is this is the reason why this&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:58.960 --> 02:31:05.520
was a trigger. I had lost my phone. When we don't&nbsp;
have our phone, we are not safe. We cannot call&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:12.399
for help. We cannot uh we cannot this, we cannot&nbsp;
that. We have to have the phone nearby because if&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:12.399 --> 02:31:18.799
a programmer or a master or a handler calls with&nbsp;
a code or instruction and we don't have our phone&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:18.800 --> 02:31:25.520
with us, we get tormented, we get electrocuted,&nbsp;
we get strangled, uh we get our head shoved into&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:25.520 --> 02:31:33.840
the toilet or we are punished or you know put into&nbsp;
solitary confinement. I didn't know this. I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:33.840 --> 02:31:39.600
know this. I thought I just had these triggers&nbsp;
that were stupid and ridiculous and didn't make&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:48.479
any sense. Um, and so just through prayer um, and&nbsp;
the orchestration of the Holy Spirit, this friend&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:48.479 --> 02:31:55.679
uh, that I was with, this event triggered it. She&nbsp;
came forward. She was actually able to speak with&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:55.680 --> 02:32:02.560
this friend and receive healing and understand&nbsp;
that she's not where she was. She has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:09.520
rescued. She's safe now. Nobody has her phone. No&nbsp;
programs or handlers even have her phone number&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:09.520 --> 02:32:17.200
anymore. She's not uh she's not she doesn't need&nbsp;
to be accessible to them and she doesn't need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:17.200 --> 02:32:22.639
feel like she has to have her phone ready in a&nbsp;
state of emergency in case something happens all&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:29.200
the time. It's not a big deal anymore. Um but I&nbsp;
wasn't able to do that process with her. I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:29.200 --> 02:32:34.960
handling it wrong. So, I was not counseling this&nbsp;
part very well. I was just kind of annoyed with&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:34.960 --> 02:32:40.880
myself and that was just making it worse. That&nbsp;
was just making it worse and increasing the self&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:46.000
harm behavior, increasing the self-loathing&nbsp;
because I didn't have understanding. And so&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:54.560
there's just an example of a way that somebody you&nbsp;
know full of wisdom full of education about did&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:54.560 --> 02:33:02.160
education about mind control programming education&nbsp;
about all of this can help to minister to these&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:02.160 --> 02:33:08.800
parts and if anyone's looking for a secular&nbsp;
resource I highly recommend Allison Miller&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:08.800 --> 02:33:16.640
um she has just such a great lay of the land uh&nbsp;
such a great workbook that you can work through um&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:16.640 --> 02:33:25.200
on your own um even um called becoming yourself.&nbsp;
And I've just found it so incredibly helpful. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:33.280
and those who have been learning to support me&nbsp;
have as well and she has a YouTube channel. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:39.439
you. We love resources on here. Obviously, of&nbsp;
course, our favorite resources come directly from&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:39.439 --> 02:33:45.200
you guys on here um who are creating resources&nbsp;
for us. But it's really great to hear, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:45.200 --> 02:33:50.080
what helps you in your journey and the other&nbsp;
people, whether it's somebody that you had person&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:55.120
in your life, like this woman that you're talking&nbsp;
that you talked about who helped you navigate that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:55.120 --> 02:34:01.359
self harm programming or people who have have&nbsp;
existed in in a book that you read, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:01.359 --> 02:34:07.759
or an author or um whatever it is that that helped&nbsp;
you along your journey. It's really good to have&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:07.760 --> 02:34:12.640
those available for survivors to sort of create&nbsp;
their own toolbox of of references that they can&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:12.640 --> 02:34:17.359
go have. So, I appreciate you sharing that story.&nbsp;
You want to bring should we talk about some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:17.359 --> 02:34:23.759
locations since we have stories of that? Let's get&nbsp;
let's, you know, let's let's just do that. Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:34.479
just get through the photo album and then anything&nbsp;
left over we could always meet a different time.

02:34:34.479 --> 02:34:44.000
So, this is uh interesting. I wanted to mention&nbsp;
um if you might tell by the change in my voice,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:51.600
this photo has brought out a a different part&nbsp;
in my system to explain. Um so this is the queen&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:51.600 --> 02:34:58.720
um in Massie Tunnel and Massie Tunnel was one&nbsp;
of the centers where I was programmed. Uh it&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:58.720 --> 02:35:07.280
is a center for the seed a seed of Satan&nbsp;
project pertaining to the beast system.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:17.840
um and the conception of uh crisper technology&nbsp;
through various uh rituals. Um and so um one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:24.800
the things that takes place in this particular&nbsp;
area and British Columbia at large, hence its&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:24.800 --> 02:35:32.800
name, British Columbia, we all know uh the the the&nbsp;
movie logo Colombia has the Luciferian, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:40.160
it's Lucifer um at the beginning of of those movie&nbsp;
movies Colombia Pictures. So, seed of Satan or&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:40.160 --> 02:35:48.160
seed of Lucifer, there's a lot of reptilian hybrid&nbsp;
technology pertaining to frogs or dragons, royal&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:55.359
bloodline families, uh monsters, hybrids. These&nbsp;
are the things that you read about in scripture&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:55.359 --> 02:36:00.319
um that happened in the days of Noah. And of&nbsp;
course, it says as it was in the days of Noah&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:00.319 --> 02:36:07.040
in Matthew 24, so it will be in the last days.&nbsp;
And so Jude, the book of Jude goes through this&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:07.040 --> 02:36:18.080
uh these types of um um projects, these types,&nbsp;
this type of um this these bloodline kingdoms,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:27.600
these hybridizations, this lust for strange flesh.&nbsp;
And so ma the queen came uh to open Massie Tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:33.760
Well, I'm sorry. The Queen of England's not coming&nbsp;
to open Massie Tunnel. Who cares about a tunnel&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:42.160
tunnel by the stinky Fraser River in in British&nbsp;
Columbia? So the the Massie tunnel is where there&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:50.160
was a lot of electroshock that I went through as&nbsp;
well as preparation and uh conception as a remote&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:50.160 --> 02:37:01.359
womb um for uh Nephilim uh Raphaim and uh various&nbsp;
um horrific and monstrous gestations, many of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:01.359 --> 02:37:07.839
which Yah has mercifully protected me from having&nbsp;
to remember fully in order to receive healing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:16.160
Um uh you know you might have heard Nathan I think&nbsp;
you you know you have had Nathan Reynolds on um he&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:24.800
talks about his his family's bloodline pertaining&nbsp;
to the dragon and so this is a location where&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:34.399
those similar types of things happen. Yeah. Wow.&nbsp;
and and so the Massie Tunnel um and not far from&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:34.399 --> 02:37:44.639
the Massie Tunnel is a paper mill where some of my&nbsp;
programming also took place. And so you see people&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:51.120
walking through it. Where um where exactly is it?&nbsp;
Is there anything you can mention that it's around&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:55.040
to give people reference if they were going&nbsp;
to go look it up or aren't familiar with it?&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:55.600 --> 02:38:03.760
So it's along the Fraser River in British&nbsp;
Columbia which is not far from the American border&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:12.000
um in Delta and so uh Delta was also part of&nbsp;
my programming uh assassin programming um so&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:19.280
I have been through beta programming and Delta&nbsp;
programming um as well as pro uh programming for&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:24.880
um well I guess the related to the&nbsp;
delta programming was was for espionage&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:24.880 --> 02:38:31.040
for the military, doing special reconnaissance,&nbsp;
um you know, doing certain missions. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:38.319
Delta though is a huge the city of Delta, there's&nbsp;
North Delta and South Delta, they're both used for&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:38.319 --> 02:38:46.960
um the the creation of Delta assassins. And so&nbsp;
these parts were you were created in this tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:51.120
There are corridors. There are many doors in this&nbsp;
tunnel. you can see if you drive through it, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:51.120 --> 02:38:56.319
you can take a corridor and it will, you know, you&nbsp;
know, they know, you know, there's there's there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:56.319 --> 02:39:02.080
corridors inside corridors and rooms within rooms&nbsp;
within rooms in this place. And so that's where&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:02.080 --> 02:39:12.479
this technology was. Um where I went through some&nbsp;
some rituals, some uh some pregnancies um and some&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:12.479 --> 02:39:18.080
you know they don't bring these things often out&nbsp;
into full gestation because they really just need&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:18.080 --> 02:39:28.960
to conceive life. Life life seems like a the wrong&nbsp;
term. conceive death in your womb in order to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:36.399
able to feed these things to the dragon that&nbsp;
we read about in the book of Revelation that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:36.399 --> 02:39:44.399
making war against the seed of of man, the seed&nbsp;
of or the seed of Yahw. And you know, it's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:44.399 --> 02:39:52.960
so ironic how something so sinister that is used&nbsp;
for something so sinister, how they invert it to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:52.960 --> 02:40:01.040
the public and make it seem like this celebratory&nbsp;
moment that is worthy of paparazzi and the queen&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:01.040 --> 02:40:06.800
coming out dressed up, you know, fully garbed&nbsp;
up with her makeup and her outfit and high heels&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:12.800
and a purse and, you know, it's just so backwards&nbsp;
whenever you whenever you think about it. Anytime&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:19.840
that I see like events like this with different&nbsp;
monuments, now my my brain is always like, what&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:25.040
is happening there? If they're celebrating it like&nbsp;
this, this has to be something that's not worth&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:29.519
celebrating. If that's what they're doing, you&nbsp;
know? So, it's really it's pretty neat that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:29.520 --> 02:40:35.280
were able to get validation through this through&nbsp;
finding this documentation and these photographs&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:35.280 --> 02:40:43.599
that can prove this this location and that show&nbsp;
it being publicly, you know, fanaticized over and,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:49.840
you know, paparazzi worthy, you know, but also&nbsp;
hearing from your side of the story what what&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:54.080
these tunnels were actually used for. How many&nbsp;
children do you remember being down there with&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:54.080 --> 02:41:01.439
you at any given time? I don't remember anyone&nbsp;
except for myself, my programmer, and another&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:01.439 --> 02:41:14.319
man. Oh my gosh. And um I was taken actually to&nbsp;
meet the queen um at her uh during her golden&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:14.319 --> 02:41:24.960
jubilee tour in 2002 October in Victoria um at the&nbsp;
Parliament building by the Empress uh hotel which&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:33.840
is owned by a family who owns something called&nbsp;
Monarch Schools. um they're also in San Diego and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:39.760
of course most I think of your viewers know what&nbsp;
monarch programming is and so I was a you know a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:39.760 --> 02:41:47.520
monarch slave. So I was taken to meet the queen&nbsp;
at this um at this this you know jubilee event&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:57.280
in Victoria um by the Empress Hotel um with this&nbsp;
friend of mine by my programmer. Um I I I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:05.280
have a full recollection of the day. Um I remember&nbsp;
being exorbitantly thirsty while I was waiting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:05.280 --> 02:42:15.759
meet her. I had been um prepped on how to properly&nbsp;
greet her. Um, and I was and so I had, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:15.760 --> 02:42:22.319
when I h when I have these memories of excessive&nbsp;
thirsts, I know that usually scapolopene or some&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:22.319 --> 02:42:30.719
kind of other drug that creates both compliance&nbsp;
submission and then also amnesia was used. Um, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:43.200
so the monarch programming, the queen, um, uh, the&nbsp;
serpent seed, and this is all biblical, um, this&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:51.599
was all a part of my programming. Victoria, BC&nbsp;
was huge. This area was huge. Lower mainland. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:59.680
Crown Packaging in Richmond, BC was one location&nbsp;
where I was programmed at night. This came forth&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:59.680 --> 02:43:08.560
through a personality uh who uh oh speaks German.&nbsp;
I didn't know I spoke German. Um until this part&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:08.560 --> 02:43:17.600
came forward to talk about the paper mill to talk&nbsp;
about uh what happened there to her at night. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:17.600 --> 02:43:24.160
and crowned crown of course crown packaging again&nbsp;
it's related. All of their codes are really quite&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:24.160 --> 02:43:31.519
out in the open. But the Golmet family, who's a&nbsp;
family of German Jewish descent from Frankfurt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:38.319
um is known for their success in banking and&nbsp;
finance. Um and so they have a code of arms of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:38.319 --> 02:43:46.000
barren with with a with it's um there's they're&nbsp;
closely related to the Roth Rothschild. Um so you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:46.000 --> 02:43:53.120
can if you're interested, you can look up James&nbsp;
Goldmid and his relationship with the Rothschild.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:53.120 --> 02:44:01.920
And so they're like a royal bloodline family going&nbsp;
back to, you know, German royalty um and um some&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:11.680
of the richest families of of Monaco. And um so&nbsp;
they they use a lot of these mills um and they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:18.399
ideal, right? Because it's really easy with&nbsp;
access to chemicals to dispose of bodies. It runs&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:18.399 --> 02:44:24.160
through the night. It's usually an industrial&nbsp;
area with not a lot of people around. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:31.439
noisy and so I went through a lot of torture and&nbsp;
behavioral conditioning at that location as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:31.439 --> 02:44:36.479
Absolutely horrifying. I'm so sorry and I'm really&nbsp;
grateful that you're shining a light on this so we&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:36.479 --> 02:44:42.639
can look at these photos and this location in a&nbsp;
different light, you know, and and realize that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:42.640 --> 02:44:48.720
if it happened to you when it did that there's&nbsp;
still likely this type of abuse happening under&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:53.439
there to children, you know, and if people are&nbsp;
around that area, please pray over it. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:53.439 --> 02:45:00.479
help share about it. Um share these photos and&nbsp;
Kadia's story. Um, it's just really, it's sad how&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:00.479 --> 02:45:07.599
many different locations, especially underground,&nbsp;
are used for these types of abuses. Um, so I'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:14.640
scroll to the next photo. That's just one of many&nbsp;
examples of some of the children's books that are&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:14.640 --> 02:45:23.920
written by Freemasons, uh, who are a part of this&nbsp;
agenda to usher in the antichrist, to further the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:30.880
seed of Satan and their agenda. Robert Munch was&nbsp;
used, Dr. Seuss was used, Harg Graves was used,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:37.200
but I just wanted to show this one um because this&nbsp;
paper bag princess, you know, we have the dragon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:45.359
we have um princess programming um that is done&nbsp;
in the monarch program, you know, because those&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:45.359 --> 02:45:50.240
there are a lot of often um that's that's the&nbsp;
whole purpose of Disney, right? the whole Disney&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:56.800
princess is to to come under to come under the&nbsp;
monarch parts that come under the jurisdiction of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:56.800 --> 02:46:03.840
the monarch and even or the monarchy and even you&nbsp;
know um Disney Disneyland or is it Disney World?&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:03.840 --> 02:46:09.840
Uh it's pro it may be both like but it might be&nbsp;
one or the other is is own is actually under the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:09.840 --> 02:46:16.880
jurisdiction of the crown. So they have their&nbsp;
own sort of legal system and it's not actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:24.240
uh Dominion of the United States. So So these&nbsp;
books are used in programming to create parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:32.240
There's a character in here that goes by the name&nbsp;
Prince. like I have I have parts in my my bus&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:32.240 --> 02:46:40.000
um in K Town that go by these characters names&nbsp;
uh because this was such a huge part of my head&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:47.520
programmer's um formula in fracturing me through&nbsp;
these processes of torture creating both of both&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:47.520 --> 02:46:54.319
these princess parts from books like this or&nbsp;
stories uh Disney that do not have uh that have&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:54.319 --> 02:47:02.479
a very narrow uh scope of reality. um that so many&nbsp;
of us healing from systematized abuse through mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:02.479 --> 02:47:08.319
control programming um are needing to bring&nbsp;
into the surface and into the present to know&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:08.319 --> 02:47:13.359
that we're not under we're not under order anymore&nbsp;
and we don't have to activate these programs that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:13.359 --> 02:47:19.439
are causing illness or distress in the body or&nbsp;
blocking memories and things. The last episode&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:19.439 --> 02:47:24.000
when you brought up Dr. Seuss that made like a&nbsp;
huge splash with people and people are like no not&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:30.960
Dr. I love them as you know, but a lot of these&nbsp;
these things that they popular popularize for&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:36.720
children, Disney, you know, hard greaves, like&nbsp;
you said, um books by Robert Munch, all these&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:36.720 --> 02:47:44.319
different um sort of things that they give our&nbsp;
kids to to cling on to. It's just disgusting, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:44.319 --> 02:47:48.319
know, the meaning, the actual meanings behind it&nbsp;
when you actually like really look at what is what&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:48.319 --> 02:47:53.359
the message is of of these different stories that&nbsp;
they tell and then realizing the nefarious ways&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:53.359 --> 02:47:58.960
that they're used on children behind the scenes&nbsp;
who go through these mind control programs. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:04.640
I I do appreciate you sharing that cuz there's a&nbsp;
lot of parents that listen to these um channels&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:11.359
and and interviews and want to be safer for&nbsp;
their kids. And this is one way that they sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:11.359 --> 02:48:20.080
sneak sneak programming and messages that can be&nbsp;
actually really damaging to children into parents'&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:20.080 --> 02:48:26.319
hands because they get popularized as being really&nbsp;
good and wholesome, you know. And so it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:26.319 --> 02:48:31.040
just good to know kind of the truth about some&nbsp;
of these things and it's like who would ever who&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:35.760
would ever guess so many of us grew up on all of&nbsp;
these different stories and books and authors and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:40.160
you know thinking about them being Freemasons puts&nbsp;
it in a different light and then also realizing&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:45.599
that we shouldn't be supporting this because&nbsp;
these are these are still likely being used today&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:52.240
on children you know as programming scripts.&nbsp;
Yeah. Yeah. And these parts often, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:58.160
they stay children, right, until they come to that&nbsp;
place of healing and we can we can work with them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:02.399
counsel them, minister them, get that trauma&nbsp;
healing so then they can grow up and be the age of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:02.399 --> 02:49:09.040
the body and then if it's ideal integrate. So they&nbsp;
stay children and so they they have a lot they've&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:14.720
believed lies, right? All of the programming is&nbsp;
done. It's undone under torture, but there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:14.720 --> 02:49:21.120
lot of deception and a lot of theatrics that are&nbsp;
done. There's a lot of staging and there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:32.960
of theater um which I know most of us are aware&nbsp;
of um excuse me I had I have a part um who was uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:41.040
programmed um on the island of St. Thomas or the&nbsp;
island of St. Thomas in the in the Virgin Islands,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:47.439
there was this big ship. There was an island. It's&nbsp;
this like it's this whole staged shipwrecked thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:47.439 --> 02:49:53.679
and these Freemasons come and they they basically&nbsp;
they strand you. They stay they they strand you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:53.680 --> 02:50:01.040
They they starve you and then they send this like&nbsp;
theater on a pirate ship over full of all of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:01.040 --> 02:50:10.080
Freemasons acting like it's, you know, the Lord of&nbsp;
the Flies. And they come and they will I will you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:10.080 --> 02:50:17.279
know abuse the the damsel in distress or the child&nbsp;
or the young woman who is being programmed who has&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:17.279 --> 02:50:25.200
been left on the island as a part of fulfilling&nbsp;
their sick their sick fantasies but to also create&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:34.319
um to also create further trauma uh for for parts&nbsp;
like it's like Hollywood all of these stories you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:34.319 --> 02:50:41.040
know Pirates of the Caribbean in it's all for&nbsp;
these kinds of these kinds of programmings. My&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:48.000
my part that had a severe eating disorder um and&nbsp;
parts with eating disorders and then parts that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:55.439
would overeat. I it was a mystery for the longest&nbsp;
time until these parts began to come forward and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:55.439 --> 02:51:04.479
explain what had happened to them. These dynamics&nbsp;
were created through um starvation um on in these&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:04.479 --> 02:51:16.559
shipwreck programs. Oh my goodness, that's&nbsp;
horrifying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was a big&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:23.520
key in that really broke something off me though.&nbsp;
um when those memories came back, it explained so&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:23.520 --> 02:51:31.439
much and I you know and I've been able to verify&nbsp;
and validate everything through research um dates,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:31.439 --> 02:51:38.799
times, locations, getting that validation. I've&nbsp;
heard that from so many different people who have&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:38.800 --> 02:51:43.600
come on the show and testified that they didn't&nbsp;
most of their memories they had never heard of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:43.600 --> 02:51:49.920
these locations or they had no memory of like&nbsp;
reading these specific books or you know seeing&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:49.920 --> 02:51:54.640
these films or whatever it was and then they&nbsp;
go look it up online and see that it's actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:54.640 --> 02:51:59.760
real like how you did you know looking up these&nbsp;
locations that you remember this underground place&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:59.760 --> 02:52:05.359
these books these authors um and then being able&nbsp;
to match them with with parts inside you you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:05.359 --> 02:52:12.319
in different systems that that are are within&nbsp;
you to be able to identify, oh, that's where&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:12.319 --> 02:52:17.759
this came from and that's what that name is from&nbsp;
or that's where this this part is from and why it&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:22.319
thinks the way that it does, you know. So, it&nbsp;
is so validating and hopefully can help people&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:22.319 --> 02:52:27.439
on the other side of the screen too. Yeah, this&nbsp;
is yeah, that's just a picture of the Empress uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:27.439 --> 02:52:34.799
the Empress Hotel um that I had mentioned um where&nbsp;
I had stayed where some of the programming takes&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:34.800 --> 02:52:42.640
place for Monarch programming and it's owned&nbsp;
by um that couple uh who owns Monarch schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:42.640 --> 02:52:48.960
Oh my gosh, it's actually really and it's known&nbsp;
as being one of It's stunningly gorgeous. It's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:48.960 --> 02:52:58.640
famous hotel. It's known for being super haunted.&nbsp;
Uh I was taken there. Uh I was taken there and uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:58.640 --> 02:53:07.920
yeah it was bad. A lot of there was a lot of like&nbsp;
um there's a lot of uh electroshock torture that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:07.920 --> 02:53:16.880
happened um in the like under the harbor under the&nbsp;
Victoria Harbor where this hotel is. There are a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:16.880 --> 02:53:23.200
lot of military submarines that are under there.&nbsp;
Um they're easy to research. That's an example of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:23.200 --> 02:53:29.679
one of the things I was able to verify like down&nbsp;
to the model of the submarine that I remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:36.560
um which was actually just retired recently. The&nbsp;
actual model of submarine has now been retired for&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:36.560 --> 02:53:42.319
a new and updated version. But there's a lot&nbsp;
of programming, a lot of ritual abuse, a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:42.319 --> 02:53:49.679
of torture that happened um in the Victoria Harbor&nbsp;
underwater. How horrifying. again like places that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:49.680 --> 02:53:55.600
people I'm sure this hotel is like for example is&nbsp;
somewhere that's like on people's destination list&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:55.600 --> 02:54:01.920
that they are just like so excited to go stay at&nbsp;
or go tour just drive by you know and again it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:01.920 --> 02:54:07.600
just horrible how they invert you know some of the&nbsp;
most beautiful things on the planet whether it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:07.600 --> 02:54:16.240
uh an actual location in nature or an something&nbsp;
built some type of architecture um and how how&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:16.240 --> 02:54:20.399
much they do damage to it, you know, or&nbsp;
the Vatican like what you've talked about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:20.399 --> 02:54:25.519
you know, it really it kind of like you can&nbsp;
look at it initially without knowing and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:30.800
be wowed and awed by it, but then like this dark&nbsp;
cloud comes over it that you can't really unsee,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:30.800 --> 02:54:34.720
which I sort of experienced just looking at this&nbsp;
initially whenever I looked at this hotel. I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:39.680
like, "Wow, it's beautiful." But it's like you&nbsp;
see the dark cloud within it as well. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:39.680 --> 02:54:47.439
sort of you almost see um you almost can like see&nbsp;
and feel the evil that is within, you know. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:47.439 --> 02:54:55.120
it's really sad that they do that. It's the other&nbsp;
There's a hotel across the harbor to the U Ocean&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:55.120 --> 02:55:04.080
Point Resort. It's a Sherin uh Sherin's uh the&nbsp;
Sherin hotel chain uh is also used uh as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:04.080 --> 02:55:12.080
It's also part of the beast system seed of Satan&nbsp;
project where people will come um it's the to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:12.080 --> 02:55:17.680
that that the whole infrastructure is completely&nbsp;
set up for programming for triggers. People are&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:17.680 --> 02:55:25.520
hired that are programmed very specifically. Um&nbsp;
it's it's quite a seamless it's quite a seamless&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:32.720
thing. But yeah, Sherin Hotels, including that&nbsp;
one, that was part of my my experience. Wow.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:40.880
One of the things that they did was they uh um in&nbsp;
the electroshock torture in this specific location&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:40.880 --> 02:55:50.640
um that is the worst ab reaction that I experience&nbsp;
is in my teeth. It's like it's wor it's a it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:58.000
it's a pain worse than pain. It's like to have&nbsp;
your teeth be electrocuted. But a a metal ball,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:04.720
electrode ball was placed in my mouth as I&nbsp;
was being brutalized and tortured so that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:04.720 --> 02:56:13.040
if I screamed or made any noise, that ball would&nbsp;
activate and it would worsen the pain and it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:19.439
actually because just there's something about the&nbsp;
teeth. It's just oh my gosh, a demented hell of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:19.439 --> 02:56:28.240
pain beyond hell. Um and so sometimes I still&nbsp;
experience that. um sensation and it's I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:33.599
I don't even have words. Um but that's part of&nbsp;
the silencing program where they teach you to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:40.479
endure symptoms, to endure pain, to endure torture&nbsp;
because when you scream or make a noise, that ball&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:40.479 --> 02:56:46.799
in your mouth will activate and shock your teeth.&nbsp;
So it's worse if you scream or cry. So you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:46.800 --> 02:56:54.560
to endure, you learn to endure it silently. And&nbsp;
so that is one of the ways that a silent scream&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:54.560 --> 02:57:01.680
um might be created. And that silent scream, you&nbsp;
know, it it needs to come out in order for that to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:01.680 --> 02:57:09.600
heal. And it's really hard because the brain will&nbsp;
rewire its neural circuitry, its neurons together&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:09.600 --> 02:57:18.160
to actually create to actually make it impossible&nbsp;
to scream or to make noise because you're when&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:18.160 --> 02:57:24.639
you're in that situation, those neurons wire&nbsp;
together. So pain equals silence, torture equals&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:31.680
silence. And it becomes biologically hardwired. So&nbsp;
there are so many people, Emma, that are walking&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:37.760
around in this kind of excruciating torment&nbsp;
and distress and and don't know why and don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:37.760 --> 02:57:43.760
know don't have words. They're not able to tell&nbsp;
anyone. They're not able to express it. They may&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:51.840
just have on a smiley face mask but are screaming&nbsp;
underneath the surface. Um because of this kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:51.840 --> 02:57:59.760
of programming, it's incredibly diabolical but&nbsp;
incredibly effective. Oh my gosh, thank you for&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:06.880
sharing that. That's another maybe key for people&nbsp;
if they've experienced that. I'm sure tooth pain&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:11.200
is just in general, it's some of the worst pain&nbsp;
that that you could ever go through. I can't even&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:19.279
imagine the level of taking it to electroshock.&nbsp;
I don't even I just can't. And it's just horrible&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:58:19.279 --> 02:58:24.719
that they're doing this to children, you know. But&nbsp;
hopefully that's a it might be a puzzle piece for&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:30.160
somebody who's experiencing that and maybe going&nbsp;
to the dentist and being treated for something&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:58:30.160 --> 02:58:38.399
that you know is is a symptom of trauma instead&nbsp;
of you know a symptom of of maybe just a general&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:58:38.399 --> 02:58:44.399
tooth ache or something like that you know. So,&nbsp;
I I pray that that this can maybe be helpful for&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:58:44.399 --> 02:58:49.200
people on the other side of the screen, too,&nbsp;
cuz I'm sure that if it's I'm sure that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:58:49.200 --> 02:58:53.840
those methods are used on a lot of children, you&nbsp;
know, and it might not be something that somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:58:53.840 --> 02:58:59.520
remembers right away. So, I really appreciate&nbsp;
you sharing that. Yeah, of course. I hate that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:58:59.520 --> 02:59:06.080
anyone else has had to go through it and and I&nbsp;
know because of how how well this infrastructure&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:59:06.080 --> 02:59:13.200
is set up. They're just cycling kids through that&nbsp;
like Monarch schools the whole you know it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:59:13.200 --> 02:59:22.479
for you know they they set up Monarch Schools as a&nbsp;
sort of a charitable reach outreach for lowincome&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:59:22.479 --> 02:59:27.919
uh more vulnerable children in our societies.&nbsp;
I mean, because they're already fractured&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:59:27.920 --> 02:59:35.200
and programmed and and easy to continue on that&nbsp;
easier to work with to continue on a mind control&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:59:35.200 --> 02:59:42.240
process. You want a mind control slave. Um, you&nbsp;
know, if you have an already fractured child,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:59:42.240 --> 02:59:48.880
um, that's, you know, that's that's where they go&nbsp;
and they look for them is for children below the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:59:48.880 --> 02:59:56.880
poverty line. And so, it's really disgusting. Um,&nbsp;
and then the the picture you have up the BC flag.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:59:56.880 --> 03:00:06.560
So I call British Columbia Atlantis. Um, it's this&nbsp;
it's the seed of Satan project. And you can see,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:00:06.560 --> 03:00:14.160
you know, that it's boasting its reigning crown&nbsp;
system, the elusarian Illuminati sun worship. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:00:14.160 --> 03:00:22.000
the surface of the earth now is 71% water. Um,&nbsp;
and I I personally believe that is because of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:27.439
increasing lawlessness that the Bible prophesies&nbsp;
leading up to the return of Christ. And you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:00:27.439 --> 03:00:35.679
some people refer to it as the Marine Kingdom&nbsp;
Network um because Yeshua cast demons named&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:00:35.680 --> 03:00:41.680
Legion back to the sea in Mark 5. And we know a&nbsp;
lot of free Masonic halls and clubs are called&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:00:41.680 --> 03:00:50.000
Legion Legions. And so that that submarine system&nbsp;
there underwater is utilized by the military,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:58.240
the government uh and business executives for you&nbsp;
know newer more sophisticated programs of of mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:00:58.240 --> 03:01:09.359
control. And so um you know I think that um yeah&nbsp;
I think you know I have a personal theory. I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:01:09.359 --> 03:01:15.679
that the new world over here, you know, that&nbsp;
a lot of programming took place on immigration&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:23.359
ships when people came over here um into North&nbsp;
America to establish the new world. Um it's it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:01:23.359 --> 03:01:30.719
my personal belief that um the new world order and&nbsp;
the merchants um that are discussed in the book of&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:01:30.720 --> 03:01:37.840
Revelation that are judged for their exports is um&nbsp;
North America. I I I think that a lot of people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:01:37.840 --> 03:01:41.439
you know, it could be the Vatican, it could be&nbsp;
this, it could be that, it could be, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:01:41.439 --> 03:01:46.960
a lot of different theories about what that is.&nbsp;
Um, but I think that a lot of a lot of programming&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:52.960
took place on immigration ships over here to&nbsp;
establish what they call the new world in order&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:01:52.960 --> 03:01:59.200
to carry the new world order through its exports&nbsp;
through Hollywood, through the media, through,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:01:59.200 --> 03:02:06.479
you know, American television and basically&nbsp;
disseminate um its lies and its propaganda and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:02:06.479 --> 03:02:13.359
its deception, you know, to the rest of the world.&nbsp;
And so, so the new world order as something that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:02:13.359 --> 03:02:20.719
coming, I think is a part of the strong delusion&nbsp;
in 2 Thessalonians 2. I think we were born into&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:02:20.720 --> 03:02:26.160
um the new world order and that was it was&nbsp;
actually you know established by you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:02:26.160 --> 03:02:32.880
you know I'm you know I'm in in my late 30s um so&nbsp;
it was you know often you know so for me it would&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:39.760
have been established around you know grandparents&nbsp;
greatgrandparents that immigrated over here for me&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:02:39.760 --> 03:02:46.160
from Ireland um and so I think that these beast&nbsp;
programs of mind control were established to&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:02:46.160 --> 03:02:51.519
make shells out of unaware people and that the&nbsp;
veneer and this veneer of the society that most&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:02:51.520 --> 03:02:59.359
are conscious of the this so-called American dream&nbsp;
and these upgrades and advancements um in you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:02:59.359 --> 03:03:08.399
submarine technology under the water here as is&nbsp;
as you can see on the BC flag um you know these&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:03:08.399 --> 03:03:16.399
upgrades permitted the controlled opposition&nbsp;
of um outdated MKLA program exposure and some&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:03:16.399 --> 03:03:22.240
payouts like the Canadian government there. There&nbsp;
was exposure. There were payouts for mind control&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:03:22.240 --> 03:03:27.439
victims, but I think it was kind of like a&nbsp;
controlled opposition thing. So, I'm here for&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:03:27.439 --> 03:03:34.399
the voices of those who are still trapped beneath&nbsp;
these waters, these deep waters of judgment that&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:03:34.399 --> 03:03:41.679
um are coming like a flood from a throne of a&nbsp;
loving God whose eye nothing escapes. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:03:41.680 --> 03:03:46.800
I think the thing everyone's waiting for, I think&nbsp;
we're in it. I think that's the deception. We're&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:03:46.800 --> 03:03:55.200
all waiting for something we were born into. Um,&nbsp;
and so, um, I'm grateful that there's there's an&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:03:55.200 --> 03:04:02.000
army of of righteousness that's rising and in an&nbsp;
exodus towards hope, healing, and and redemption.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:04:02.000 --> 03:04:10.160
Um, because time is very short. And scripture&nbsp;
says the dragon uh the dragon is is seeking&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:16.240
um whom he may devour because Satan knows his&nbsp;
time on this earth is short. And so this dragon&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:25.439
programming through monarch through places like&nbsp;
the Massie tunnel um is um is only growing as time&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:04:25.439 --> 03:04:33.200
goes on. And and thankfully, you know, we have all&nbsp;
of these things have been prophesied and foretold&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:04:33.200 --> 03:04:43.760
of in scripture in and it's very clear. Um and&nbsp;
so we we know that that there's an antidote.

03:04:43.760 --> 03:04:49.279
Thank you for sharing that. That's fascinating and&nbsp;
horrifying all at once, but it actually makes a&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:04:49.279 --> 03:04:54.800
lot of sense. And the iconography here is also&nbsp;
interesting. I never really put it together in&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:04:54.800 --> 03:05:02.000
my head that like crowns also resemble the sun,&nbsp;
which is kind of it's like neat to recognize that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:07.120
but it also is, you know, it it's very occultic,&nbsp;
you know, and again, something that's like&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:05:07.120 --> 03:05:11.760
celebrated and heralded. It's like, why even have&nbsp;
a crown? But it's like, well, it makes it makes&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:05:11.760 --> 03:05:16.479
some sense if you think about it from occultic&nbsp;
symbology, too. But that's really good insight for&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:05:16.479 --> 03:05:21.279
people to know and to sort of ponder. Oh, I just&nbsp;
switched the screen. Indian residential school&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:05:21.279 --> 03:05:28.479
survivor on the Queen's alleged connection to&nbsp;
missing children. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:05:28.479 --> 03:05:37.759
you know the queen is, I wouldn't say it's a she,&nbsp;
right? Um an it, more of an it. Um yeah, there is&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:05:37.760 --> 03:05:45.520
so much. Oh, there's there is so much um so there&nbsp;
is just so much because these children are being&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:05:45.520 --> 03:05:52.960
gathered and collected and kidnapped to sacrifice&nbsp;
to the dragon to empower the spirit of lawlessness&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:05:52.960 --> 03:05:59.439
and the spirit of the antichrist. And so there,&nbsp;
you know, there's it's not hard to you don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:05:59.439 --> 03:06:07.359
to do a lot of red stringing. It's hard hardly&nbsp;
a conspiracy anymore, right? I have a guest that&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:06:07.359 --> 03:06:15.279
is reoccurring on my show from Canada named Kevin&nbsp;
Annet who has been exposing Canadian residential&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:06:15.279 --> 03:06:20.960
and indigenous schools, the genocide that occurs&nbsp;
in it. And he's he hasn't gone in depth about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:06:20.960 --> 03:06:25.279
but he's mentioned, you know, that there's been&nbsp;
allegations against the queen with that. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:06:25.279 --> 03:06:30.000
you're helping to sort of connect some other dots&nbsp;
from other people, too, and validate that. Um, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:36.560
that's interesting that you found this headline&nbsp;
for it. Yeah. Oh, that's just this picture here&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:06:36.560 --> 03:06:50.560
on the screen is is a is a picture of uh of a one&nbsp;
one of many um men uh who were involved in um the&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:06:50.560 --> 03:06:55.520
I'm trying to think of a polite way to say this.&nbsp;
There really isn't. And and quite frankly, I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:06:55.520 --> 03:07:03.760
done being polite, but the but very demented and&nbsp;
defiling pornography, including snuff films. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:07:03.760 --> 03:07:13.439
so, um, I was both in the films as a participant&nbsp;
as well as, um, trained as a videographer, um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:07:13.439 --> 03:07:20.639
on professional film cameras to have to film these&nbsp;
things. And, uh, this is a this is a photo of of&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:07:20.640 --> 03:07:29.040
the the man and he's doing, as you can see, if&nbsp;
you look up uh, Freemason or Masonic hand signals,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:07:29.040 --> 03:07:36.640
um, this is what they do. So, this was the photo&nbsp;
that was put um in the newspaper or in the 70s&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:07:36.640 --> 03:07:44.640
when he first established what is a guitar factory&nbsp;
in Vancouver. And I was trafficked to this guitar&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:07:44.640 --> 03:07:57.439
factory, taken to meet this uh person at uh at&nbsp;
night um by a photographer that my school sent me&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:07:57.439 --> 03:08:04.479
with on a work practicum because I was an aspiring&nbsp;
photographer. So I was 15 years old. I was doing a&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:08:04.479 --> 03:08:11.120
work placement with this photographer already.&nbsp;
Huge red flag. teenage girl alone in the car&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:08:11.120 --> 03:08:22.559
with a man. Um, so he took me to this man. Um, and&nbsp;
this guitar factory ended up being a location for&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:08:22.560 --> 03:08:35.760
um a very lucrative uh industry of of pornography&nbsp;
in some of the most uh perverse and um yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:08:35.760 --> 03:08:44.880
it was it was hard. It was I don't even have&nbsp;
words. Um yeah. So that's but that's an example&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:08:44.880 --> 03:08:52.000
that I mean this photo is a photo of him taken&nbsp;
in the 70s when he established um these guitars.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:59.279
And so that was a huge center for both trafficking&nbsp;
and and pornographic uh films. Oh my gosh, that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:08:59.279 --> 03:09:05.920
horrific. Including including SNAF. So yeah. Yeah.&nbsp;
so terrible that people don't understand that&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:09:05.920 --> 03:09:11.200
these things exist, you know, and like I mean you&nbsp;
look at you look at him, we can't see his face,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:17.519
but he just looks like a normal person like just&nbsp;
wearing a t-shirt and like he doesn't fit like&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:09:17.520 --> 03:09:22.800
what we'd think oh predator predator, you know,&nbsp;
like it just looks like a normal dude that just&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:09:22.800 --> 03:09:27.120
like, you know, hangs out at dive bars and like&nbsp;
plays in a band. Like that's what it looks like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:09:27.120 --> 03:09:33.120
you know? It's crazy that these people just&nbsp;
walk among us and we have no idea. And they&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:09:33.120 --> 03:09:40.319
do and they did a lot of like side projects too&nbsp;
in the programming as well. It wasn't just for&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:09:40.319 --> 03:09:45.359
u like pornography. And you can see that signal&nbsp;
through you could you could see that signaled&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:09:45.359 --> 03:09:50.240
through the hand. You can come here. This is&nbsp;
where you can come. You can you know bring this&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:09:50.240 --> 03:09:55.519
this person. You have a mind control slave. You&nbsp;
can bring them here for this programming. A lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:09:55.520 --> 03:10:05.200
of us were taught uh musical skills, uh different&nbsp;
things, um in order to be able to do and perform&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:10:05.200 --> 03:10:15.279
certain fetishes or acts for certain members of&nbsp;
the the the brotherhood. Um and so music it music&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:10:15.279 --> 03:10:20.880
and in programming is is a really big part of&nbsp;
it as well as developing particular skills and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:10:20.880 --> 03:10:27.359
talents. And so it wasn't totally random that&nbsp;
it was a guitar factory. So this is a picture&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:10:27.359 --> 03:10:36.240
that you just put on. This green hallway um is&nbsp;
in the uh Halley Research Center of Antarctica.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:10:36.240 --> 03:10:46.080
Um which is one of the laboratories for crisper&nbsp;
technology that I was flown to. Um a part of me,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:10:46.080 --> 03:10:55.439
I mean it was me. I have a part named January who&nbsp;
is my Antarctica part. And so uh so she was taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:10:55.439 --> 03:11:03.439
there both as a subject for crisper technology&nbsp;
and hybrid experiences as a remote womb and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:11:03.439 --> 03:11:12.960
gestation for the seed of the beast. Um but I also&nbsp;
worked uh as a laboratory assistant. uh January&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:11:12.960 --> 03:11:21.200
um was being trained in molecular uh biology um in&nbsp;
Antarctica and it was at both this Holly research&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:11:21.200 --> 03:11:30.160
center and the Roth era research center as well.&nbsp;
Um, and that information came forth because I kept&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:37.680
having flashbacks of being in Antarctica with a&nbsp;
particular program programmer having landed on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:11:37.680 --> 03:11:43.120
helicopter at the top of the hill looking down at&nbsp;
what I was able to identify eventually on research&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:11:43.120 --> 03:11:49.439
as the Ruther Research Center. And I was wearing&nbsp;
uh this orange these orange suits. I kept having&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:11:49.439 --> 03:11:55.839
these memories of these orange suits. And so I&nbsp;
I started to do research and and um established&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:11:55.840 --> 03:12:02.720
Okay. So, I was wearing a cold water immersion&nbsp;
suit. I immersion suit um in these memories and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:12:02.720 --> 03:12:07.600
um so then I began to look at okay, why was&nbsp;
I wearing a cold water immersion suit? What&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:12:07.600 --> 03:12:16.160
is this for? Um and I didn't get very far um until&nbsp;
uh this part was ready to come forward and divulge&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:24.160
um some things that I will be releasing um in&nbsp;
in my book. Um I have to wait for the fullness&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:12:24.160 --> 03:12:31.040
of the testimony and some other things to be esta&nbsp;
established to um to share further details of what&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:12:31.040 --> 03:12:37.120
happened. Um there's also the Spalbard seed vault&nbsp;
that's in Antarctica as well where there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:12:37.120 --> 03:12:43.680
of like experiments in um like biod like just a&nbsp;
lot of you know they say it's just for the protect&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:49.760
they're studying they're studying the earth they&nbsp;
say they're just studying biodiversity they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:12:49.760 --> 03:12:55.200
you know they're studying the ozone lay the ozone&nbsp;
layer they're studying the environment up there&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:12:55.200 --> 03:13:02.000
it's not it's just a highly classified projects&nbsp;
and they have very specific tours to protect tend&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:07.520
to give the public a sense of openness about&nbsp;
what's really happening at these centers. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:13:07.520 --> 03:13:18.240
they're actually uh creating monsters in these&nbsp;
laboratories both in and outside of the wombs of&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:13:18.240 --> 03:13:27.200
uh young girls um and monarch slaves. And um&nbsp;
that's what I'm going to one of the things I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:13:27.200 --> 03:13:34.800
going to be writing about. And here's an example&nbsp;
of uh another hallway. So the last hallway you saw&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:13:34.800 --> 03:13:41.760
was create was um painted in a very specific shade&nbsp;
of green um that's used in the color programming&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:13:41.760 --> 03:13:47.840
in order to activate a certain part. So, this&nbsp;
is a public restroom um that I just discovered&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:13:47.840 --> 03:13:59.600
on happen stance that is a uh a place to um bring&nbsp;
children um who are programmed to sexually abuse&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:13:59.600 --> 03:14:07.439
them in these spaces. Because if you have a a if&nbsp;
if somebody's in the cult and they have a child&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:14:07.439 --> 03:14:13.759
who has been in this color programming, then&nbsp;
this color programming is is activating this&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:14:13.760 --> 03:14:21.200
part to come forward and to receive the sexual&nbsp;
trauma or to perform the sexual trauma and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:14:21.200 --> 03:14:27.359
uh not remember it because it's a a part a&nbsp;
dissociative part. And so I saw this bathroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:14:27.359 --> 03:14:34.559
and I just I walked into one of the stalls and I&nbsp;
sat down and I began to weep and I just began to&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:14:34.560 --> 03:14:44.000
pray and just pray and just weep and pray and um&nbsp;
and so this is just a really common thing. Um I&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:49.760
don't know how many bathrooms there are that are&nbsp;
painted in this specific color. Um, but one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:14:49.760 --> 03:14:58.479
uh people who programmed me uh chose this paint&nbsp;
color for another member of my family's kitchen&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:14:58.479 --> 03:15:09.040
to in order to keep that programming software&nbsp;
reactivated um in this other member of the cult.

03:15:09.040 --> 03:15:14.640
Oh my gosh, these it's just so funky. Like&nbsp;
it's hard. It almost look just looks like&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:15:14.640 --> 03:15:20.080
a center for children or some type of like,&nbsp;
you know, fun house for kids. Like this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:15:20.080 --> 03:15:25.359
weird to think that adults would paint it this&nbsp;
color for something professional. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:15:25.359 --> 03:15:31.679
it definitely has that vibe of mind control. And&nbsp;
especially the specific colors that they chose,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:15:31.680 --> 03:15:39.600
like you said, were no accident. It was for an&nbsp;
intended purpose. It was. and and and just you&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:15:39.600 --> 03:15:46.960
know just just to be you know I have to say as&nbsp;
as like it took my breath away when I saw this&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:15:46.960 --> 03:15:52.640
hallway of bathrooms. I was just at the beach. I&nbsp;
walk in and I just like I could hardly breathe. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:15:52.640 --> 03:15:59.279
was just it took my breath away um cuz that was&nbsp;
very triggering for me. But because it did not&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:15:59.279 --> 03:16:04.639
co it did not cause me to switch. So I was able&nbsp;
to have that moment of healing in that bathroom&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:16:04.640 --> 03:16:11.760
stall. I didn't switch into my color programmed&nbsp;
part because the word of Yahw and his grace and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:16:11.760 --> 03:16:17.840
love has broken that down with his truth and&nbsp;
he's renewing my mind and he's not giving me a&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:16:17.840 --> 03:16:23.600
spirit of fear. He's given me a sound mind. And&nbsp;
so now, you know, I could walk into a situation&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:16:23.600 --> 03:16:30.399
like that and I I'm supposed to be programmed with&nbsp;
that color. like in Antarctica, I walk down that&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:16:30.399 --> 03:16:38.639
hallway to go to do my task and I'm supposed to&nbsp;
switch into January. But instead, I was able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:16:38.640 --> 03:16:47.279
be co-conscious of January and grieve with her&nbsp;
and and um and and just pray in that space and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:16:47.279 --> 03:16:53.439
and not be triggered into a dissociative state,&nbsp;
but actually minister to this part of my soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:16:54.239 --> 03:16:57.359
It's really amazing, too, that you&nbsp;
were able to get actual photos. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:16:57.359 --> 03:17:09.279
sure that there's not a lot of um things&nbsp;
online where they're showcasing this. No,

03:17:09.279 --> 03:17:15.359
but if you see a color, if you see like a color&nbsp;
that color in a dentist in in a dental office&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:17:15.359 --> 03:17:26.719
or a or a um any kind of institution run because&nbsp;
that is there for uh that is there to make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:17:26.720 --> 03:17:32.960
that their employees programmed parts come out&nbsp;
to perform their tasks without them knowing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:17:32.960 --> 03:17:41.520
um or even the patrons of such a such a a business&nbsp;
or an institute. Um so that gate that so I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:17:41.520 --> 03:17:47.920
was showing some examples in these pictures here&nbsp;
that you see of just an unnecessary amount of&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:17:47.920 --> 03:17:55.120
security around this bathroom. There's like bars,&nbsp;
extra doors, extra dead bolts, and extra locks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:17:55.120 --> 03:18:04.880
which would lead me to believe that this bathroom&nbsp;
isn't just um some cult member. Um and this would&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:18:04.880 --> 03:18:11.279
signal this is a very high cult community that&nbsp;
this bathroom is here just as coming in with a ch&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:18:11.279 --> 03:18:18.399
with a child to abuse them. But the but this would&nbsp;
facility would actually be used and locked up and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:18:18.399 --> 03:18:24.479
um things programming would happen within within&nbsp;
this bathroom. Everything is painted green too.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:18:24.479 --> 03:18:29.839
The countertops things that I I didn't even&nbsp;
picture there. Um I didn't take pictures I&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:18:29.840 --> 03:18:34.319
didn't give pictures of all of it but it's all&nbsp;
painted in that color. And you'll see they've lo&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:18:34.319 --> 03:18:41.120
they they keep it like a prison. Oh my gosh.&nbsp;
Yeah. That is so bizarre. That is so weird.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:18:41.120 --> 03:18:44.880
It looks like it should be some like piece&nbsp;
of art or something. Just looks so out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:18:44.880 --> 03:18:57.200
place. Yeah. Public bathroom. Dead bolts. Yeah.&nbsp;
Yeah. Like why is that why is that necessary?

03:18:57.200 --> 03:19:08.080
Yeah. That's okay. So in this picture you see&nbsp;
so that is a lo the logo on the coat of an oral&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:19:08.080 --> 03:19:15.279
surgeon in the monarch program in his office.&nbsp;
He has a big painting of Felix the cat that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:19:15.279 --> 03:19:22.000
all pixelated just like this logo you see on&nbsp;
his shirt of a pixelated face. This represents&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:28.720
fracturing the one's identity, right? Your face,&nbsp;
your identity. And the pixelation represents the&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:19:28.720 --> 03:19:36.239
fracturing, the programming and these, I call it&nbsp;
software that is installed through ritual torture.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:19:36.239 --> 03:19:44.000
And so this oral surgeon when I went in at 19&nbsp;
to have my wisdom teeth taken out um gave me a&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:53.200
tetrototoxin. Um and uh this is what I believe it&nbsp;
was because the anesthetic put me into a state of&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:19:53.200 --> 03:20:01.200
paralysis but full awareness. So I could not move,&nbsp;
speak, but I could feel all of the pain of all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:20:01.200 --> 03:20:07.840
the things that he was doing to me. And he was&nbsp;
very very very sadist sadistic and would um and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:20:07.840 --> 03:20:14.399
he had uh electrodes hooked up from my brain to a&nbsp;
monitor so he could see because I couldn't scream&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:20:14.399 --> 03:20:20.559
or move. He could see the level of pain that I&nbsp;
was going through as he was administering certain&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:20:20.560 --> 03:20:26.960
types of torture including rape. He he got off on&nbsp;
the pain the more pain I was in. And he would ask&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:20:26.960 --> 03:20:32.160
me I could hear him asking right and I can't move.&nbsp;
I could hear him asking me how does this feel? How&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:20:32.160 --> 03:20:38.880
does this feel? Like it was so sick and so uh&nbsp;
demented that I actually wrote a letter to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:20:38.880 --> 03:20:49.279
recently um anonymously to tell him I know what&nbsp;
he does. I know what he is about. I remember and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:20:49.279 --> 03:20:58.000
uh that he better repent because he is he is&nbsp;
under the wrath of Yah. And um you know it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:04.399
really therapeutic to write it. uh so therapeutic&nbsp;
to write it that I didn't mail it but I might. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:21:04.399 --> 03:21:12.479
and this part this is the personality that that&nbsp;
took this traumas her name is Molina and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:21:12.479 --> 03:21:23.599
um uh it's still traumatic just for me even to&nbsp;
go to the dentist. um this part makes it really&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:21:23.600 --> 03:21:31.200
hard to make it to the appointment and I never&nbsp;
understood why for the longest time. Um you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:21:31.200 --> 03:21:40.479
until until I did. And was this the is this&nbsp;
the the same dentist who would have you were&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:21:40.479 --> 03:21:44.959
talking about your teeth earlier and the ball that&nbsp;
would go in your mouth. Was that was that any of&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:21:44.960 --> 03:21:50.800
that happened at the office or was that separate?&nbsp;
Completely separate. This was a one-time occasion,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:21:50.800 --> 03:21:58.720
but it was especially horrific what he did. Um,&nbsp;
the electricity that he did, it was a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:21:58.720 --> 03:22:09.840
like electrocuting like probes of electrocuting&nbsp;
rape in every orifice. Um, and then sealed off,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:22:09.840 --> 03:22:18.479
uh, you know, with his own, you know, getting off&nbsp;
on it all. Yeah. Yeah. So, it wasn't scary enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:22:18.479 --> 03:22:24.639
Oh my gosh. Yeah. When I looked him up, when the&nbsp;
memories came back in, um I I when I looked him up&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:22:24.640 --> 03:22:31.600
and I saw his website and I saw this logo logo,&nbsp;
I mean, he's very, you know, does very well. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:22:31.600 --> 03:22:36.720
when I saw this picture of him with that logo,&nbsp;
again, this is the type of confirmation that I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:22:36.720 --> 03:22:42.239
talking about when I have memories and and I want&nbsp;
to validate them. You just do a little research.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:22:42.239 --> 03:22:47.359
Okay, here's the guy I remember. Okay. Yep. Here's&nbsp;
his website. Oh, Monarch program. Look, look at&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:22:47.359 --> 03:22:51.759
he's got butterflies all over his waiting room.&nbsp;
You know, look at this. Look at that. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:22:51.760 --> 03:22:57.520
it's just all of these validating things. Not that&nbsp;
that's necessary in order to for your memories to&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:22:57.520 --> 03:23:03.680
be valid, but it does, you know, it does help&nbsp;
and it it's pretty interesting. the I was also&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:23:03.680 --> 03:23:11.840
uh I was also um the dental and the orthodont&nbsp;
the orthodontist or oral surgeon industry is&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:23:11.840 --> 03:23:18.880
really just um I mean I think that there's a&nbsp;
reason the high sui one of the highest suicide&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:23:18.880 --> 03:23:24.880
rates as far as careers are concerned as a dentist&nbsp;
because there's the omega programming which is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:23:24.880 --> 03:23:32.000
suicide programming um that is is created in the&nbsp;
event that something goes wrong or somebody's is&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:38.160
disobedient or wants to get out. Um because these&nbsp;
dentists have access to anesthetic and I worked&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:23:38.160 --> 03:23:44.960
for an orthodontist. I nannied for his family. I&nbsp;
I looked after his daughter for 10 years. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:23:44.960 --> 03:23:54.160
this was a a job that was set up by my handler. Um&nbsp;
and so he was a big part of of of my programming.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:23:54.160 --> 03:24:04.160
Um, and he um um, as it turned out, hired me&nbsp;
to actually I thought I was just nannying um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:24:04.160 --> 03:24:12.960
for the family, but uh, because I was a slave&nbsp;
of this cult um, he had actually hired me to&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:24:12.960 --> 03:24:20.239
participate in programming his young daughter.&nbsp;
Um, which is really which is really hard um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:24:20.239 --> 03:24:33.840
to um, reconcile. Um, yeah. Oh my gosh, this is&nbsp;
all just so eye opening what you're sharing. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:24:33.840 --> 03:24:40.160
this was this dentist is separate from the other&nbsp;
photos that we were showing of the green facility.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:46.880
Was there anything else from Antarctica that you&nbsp;
wanted to share? Not yet. Yeah, I think that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:24:46.880 --> 03:24:55.120
good for now. Um, well, I will share. Okay, so I&nbsp;
will share. There is a huge huge huge huge huge&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:24:55.120 --> 03:25:06.559
huge seed vault of genetic seed uh bloodline&nbsp;
seed um pertaining to the Trump family. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:25:06.560 --> 03:25:16.800
and so a lot of my um, involvement there, um, was&nbsp;
overseeing and monitoring and creating petri dish&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:25:16.800 --> 03:25:26.640
embryos, um, for the lucky chosen of the&nbsp;
cult who would receive um, would receive&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:25:26.640 --> 03:25:32.640
an implantation that they would believe was a&nbsp;
natural pregnancy between them and their spouse,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:25:32.640 --> 03:25:43.120
but grafted in to the the genes uh between the the&nbsp;
the um the helix uh the helix on the mom's side,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:49.920
the helix on the dad's side, and then you have&nbsp;
the helix from like a hybrid or a bloodline&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:25:49.920 --> 03:25:54.160
family like Trump would be grafted in just like&nbsp;
Hit, you know, the Nazis have been doing this&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:25:54.160 --> 03:25:59.920
forever. This is a big thing that Hitler was all&nbsp;
about. He wanted to create all kinds of little&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:25:59.920 --> 03:26:06.960
Hitlers. And so he so the Nazis were really big on&nbsp;
experimenting on how to impregnate as many women&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:26:06.960 --> 03:26:14.640
as possible with the seed of Hitler. And so that's&nbsp;
a big part of this this spirit of the Antichrist.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:26:14.640 --> 03:26:23.359
And so there are a ton of people walking around&nbsp;
uh who have um Trump genetics that have no idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:26:23.359 --> 03:26:29.439
It doesn't mean they're not biologically their&nbsp;
their parents that they know. Um, but they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:26:29.439 --> 03:26:35.919
graft they would graft in an extra helix um in&nbsp;
these laboratories in order to spread the seed&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:26:35.920 --> 03:26:41.359
of Satan or the seed of Lucifer or the seed of&nbsp;
the beast, however you want to look at it. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:26:41.359 --> 03:26:48.880
and this is not new. The the the fallen ones or&nbsp;
the Nephilim have been teaching humankind to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:26:48.880 --> 03:26:55.920
this um, you know, since the beginning. read the&nbsp;
book of Jeremiah, the book of Jude. Um I have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:26:55.920 --> 03:27:03.680
picture on the slideshow here that anyone can&nbsp;
screenshot um coming up of biblical references&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:27:03.680 --> 03:27:11.920
um so that uh you we can see this is this is not&nbsp;
just something that is being made up. This is the&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:27:11.920 --> 03:27:20.080
state of hum of our world from the beginning.&nbsp;
this war has been going on. And there it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:27:20.080 --> 03:27:30.160
for anybody watching. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Take&nbsp;
a picture for sure. Uh can the Canaanites in&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:27:30.160 --> 03:27:40.479
scripture were trafficked um you know humankind&nbsp;
is just depraved um is just depraved um without&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:27:40.479 --> 03:27:53.359
you know a compass of righteousness that that I I&nbsp;
really believe you know we find in his word and um

03:27:53.359 --> 03:28:00.080
you know uh I really recommend looking these&nbsp;
up. you'll find them fascinating. Um Jeremiah&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:28:00.080 --> 03:28:07.200
5 talks about how the rich are the devourers&nbsp;
of children and that devouring of children is&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:28:07.200 --> 03:28:13.920
a judgment for turning aside from Yahw because&nbsp;
iniquity only increases and multiplies itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:28:13.920 --> 03:28:25.680
Sin begets sin. Um, Zechariah 11:17 talks about,&nbsp;
you know, Freemason style shepherds, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:28:25.680 --> 03:28:35.520
who who who have these weird swords and rituals&nbsp;
pertaining to their right eye um and their arms&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:28:35.520 --> 03:28:45.439
that you seem masons today making hand signals&nbsp;
with. Um Jeremiah 57:3 talks about people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:28:45.439 --> 03:28:52.160
sacrifice their children among the oak trees.&nbsp;
Well, we know Bohemian Grove and oak trees are&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:28:52.160 --> 03:29:00.559
a huge part of free Masonic culture. Um Isaiah&nbsp;
57 goes on to talk about um those who slaughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:29:00.560 --> 03:29:09.840
their children under ravines, under clefts and&nbsp;
crags. Um, a lot of today's Masonic buildings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:29:09.840 --> 03:29:19.200
um, measurements and themes visually pertained&nbsp;
to Solomon's temple. Um, some still use certain&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:29:19.200 --> 03:29:31.439
specifications like that um, based on 1 Chronicles&nbsp;
22, 2 Chronicles 20. Um, and um, and and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:29:31.439 --> 03:29:40.879
they insire themselves in their own net. And Yah&nbsp;
according to um Psalm 9 avenges all of this blood&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:29:40.880 --> 03:29:46.880
that is spilled. And he does not ignore the cries&nbsp;
of the afflicted. And he says that he is known by&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:29:46.880 --> 03:29:54.800
his acts of justice and that these specific wicked&nbsp;
people are ins snared by the works of their hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:29:55.359 --> 03:30:01.599
Um, Leviticus talks about wizards being&nbsp;
put to death who are giving seed to moolak,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:30:01.600 --> 03:30:10.319
drinking blood, using enchantments. Um, it's all&nbsp;
in the word. We don't we don't need as as much as&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:30:10.319 --> 03:30:18.880
like podcasts and documentaries. All of these are&nbsp;
so valuable and continue to be valuable in my life&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:30:18.880 --> 03:30:25.680
and in the lives of many. It's, you know, it's all&nbsp;
in the word. There's nothing new under the sun as&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:30:25.680 --> 03:30:32.960
it says in Ecclesiastes. And so, and so I wanted&nbsp;
to put these scriptures forth because if all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:30:32.960 --> 03:30:38.479
this is true and it's still going on and it has&nbsp;
always been, then there is an antidote. And and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:30:38.479 --> 03:30:45.279
the antidote isn't just found in the word, it&nbsp;
is the word itself. It is alive. And so I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:30:45.279 --> 03:30:52.399
really encourage people to get into it and see if&nbsp;
these things are true because if this is true then&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:30:52.399 --> 03:30:58.799
um everything else that is written in this book&nbsp;
is as well. And there's good news as horrific as&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:30:58.800 --> 03:31:06.880
all of this is. There's a lot of good news. Yes,&nbsp;
there is. And another survivor that you mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:31:06.880 --> 03:31:14.319
earlier, Nathan Reynolds, he also speaks on,&nbsp;
and I I don't remember if it's the exact same&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:31:14.319 --> 03:31:19.759
um scriptures that you picked out here, but&nbsp;
he's been a big advocate for sharing different&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:31:19.760 --> 03:31:28.000
um scriptures and passages of where SR, did um&nbsp;
you know, human sacrifice, these different things&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:31:28.000 --> 03:31:33.279
existed in the Bible and that that we can, like&nbsp;
you said, go back in time and see it. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:31:33.279 --> 03:31:40.319
Lisa Meister has talked about um that a little bit&nbsp;
on some of her shows. So, I mean, there are we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:31:40.319 --> 03:31:46.000
sort of seeing the world through a different lens.&nbsp;
And I think the reason why people currently have&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:31:46.000 --> 03:31:53.120
not is because the lack of knowledge on did SRRA,&nbsp;
mind control. They just don't know what they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:31:53.120 --> 03:31:58.160
reading. Where when you learn about this stuff&nbsp;
and then you go back to the Bible and look, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:31:58.160 --> 03:32:02.720
can sort of see see it clear as day that there's&nbsp;
that there's multiple examples. and you gave a lot&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:32:02.720 --> 03:32:08.319
of them. So, I do encourage people to do their own&nbsp;
research, take a screenshot, go check it out. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:32:08.319 --> 03:32:14.080
do you have any episodes or I know your podcast&nbsp;
isn't up. Um, have you done a podcast on anybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:32:14.080 --> 03:32:21.279
else's show that has gone through some of these&nbsp;
more in depth? Not yet. Uh, would love to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:32:21.279 --> 03:32:26.080
that at some time. It would be awesome because&nbsp;
this just scratches the surface. Even this list&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:32:26.080 --> 03:32:32.160
of scriptures there, that's just the tip of the&nbsp;
iceberg. There there are far more references. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:32:32.160 --> 03:32:39.200
but if you want to subscribe to our our YouTube&nbsp;
channel, um, uh, right now we just have the music&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:32:39.200 --> 03:32:46.080
and, um, we may release something like that in&nbsp;
the future. Um, and so if if you're curious on&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:32:46.080 --> 03:32:54.720
staying tuned, um, you can, um, there's a passage&nbsp;
in the book of wisdom, and I I don't quote the&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:32:54.720 --> 03:33:00.800
book of wisdom. It's by King Solomon. I don't&nbsp;
I don't quote this as the inspired word of Yah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:33:00.800 --> 03:33:06.560
but the writings of antiquity are super valid,&nbsp;
as a historical account of what was happening&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:33:06.560 --> 03:33:15.040
then. It's happening now. And it says here, I&nbsp;
have I have a quote um that I just wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:33:15.040 --> 03:33:22.720
share because this was written in between the&nbsp;
first first century BC and first century AD.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:33:23.279 --> 03:33:30.399
It says, "For your judgments, for Yahw's judgments&nbsp;
are great and hard to interpret. Therefore,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:33:30.399 --> 03:33:39.599
undisiplined souls went astray." Now, listen this.&nbsp;
Tell me if you think this sounds like a did or a a&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:33:39.600 --> 03:33:47.120
fractured soul to you with amnesic barriers.&nbsp;
It says, "For when lawless men had supposed&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:33:47.120 --> 03:33:54.160
that they held a holy nation in their power, they&nbsp;
prisoners of darkness and bound in the feathers&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:33:54.160 --> 03:34:03.200
of a long night, kept close beneath their roofs,&nbsp;
lay exiled from the eternal providence. For while&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:34:03.200 --> 03:34:11.439
they thought that they were unseen in their secret&nbsp;
sins, they were divided from one another by a dark&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:34:11.439 --> 03:34:20.160
curtain of forgetfulness, stricken with terrible&nbsp;
awe and very troubled by apparitions. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:34:20.160 --> 03:34:26.880
it sounds a lot like somebody going through like&nbsp;
the torment of a mental illness or schizophrenia&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:34:26.880 --> 03:34:32.239
or somebody who's just really suffering and&nbsp;
and doesn't understand why. It could be a dark&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:34:32.239 --> 03:34:39.519
curtain of forgetfulness through trauma, through&nbsp;
these very sadistic means that are generationally&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:34:39.520 --> 03:34:47.520
practiced and handed down through um through many&nbsp;
generations. And then it says, "For neither did&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:34:47.520 --> 03:34:54.160
the dark recesses that held them guard them from&nbsp;
their fears, but terrifying sounds rang around&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:34:54.160 --> 03:35:00.639
them, and dismal phantoms appeared with unsmiling&nbsp;
faces." And it goes on. I mean, so the book of&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:35:00.640 --> 03:35:07.439
wisdom is really interesting and it talks about&nbsp;
this, I believe, exactly what we're talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:35:07.439 --> 03:35:15.040
today. Wow. That would be kind of a an interesting&nbsp;
episode to do with you sometime to pour focus into&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:35:15.040 --> 03:35:20.800
just that topic. I think listeners would be really&nbsp;
curious to learn about that too. So maybe we could&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:35:20.800 --> 03:35:26.080
plan doing that sometime, you know, and and&nbsp;
like do a real deep dive into the ones that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:35:26.080 --> 03:35:30.800
provided today, which I hope that you guys took&nbsp;
a screenshot of. if not go back and do it. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:35:30.800 --> 03:35:35.680
and then you know any others that you want to add&nbsp;
to it? We could sort of spend some time looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:35:35.680 --> 03:35:41.680
at them through a different lens. That would be&nbsp;
great. It would be that would be I would be such&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:35:41.680 --> 03:35:47.840
a blessing. I'd love to dig in deeper. Uh cuz, you&nbsp;
know, these, you know, wisdom book of wisdom even&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:35:47.840 --> 03:35:55.600
talks about dragons, the worshiping of dragons&nbsp;
and uh irrational reptiles and, you know, um&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:35:55.600 --> 03:36:01.279
Jasher and Enoch as well. And then of course, you&nbsp;
know, all all through scripture. It would be good&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:36:01.279 --> 03:36:08.960
to it would be good to do an episode. I'd love to&nbsp;
explore and dig into more of why all of this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:36:08.960 --> 03:36:16.960
taking place. Um because it's really important um&nbsp;
that we thoroughly understand the world in which&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:36:16.960 --> 03:36:23.439
we live in. Amen. Let's talk about that after.&nbsp;
Maybe we can look at the schedule and and plan&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:36:23.439 --> 03:36:27.919
something in the, you know, near future in the&nbsp;
next couple months and do a deep dive. That would&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:36:27.920 --> 03:36:39.200
be great. And for this episode, was there anything&nbsp;
that we didn't cover that you wanted to share? Um,

03:36:39.200 --> 03:36:46.399
I think that was we covered so much. you know,&nbsp;
I'm there's still questions that I'm sure people&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:36:46.399 --> 03:36:50.239
are going to have and there's like so many&nbsp;
different, you know, more conversations that&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:36:50.239 --> 03:36:55.920
we could probably have about all the stuff that&nbsp;
we talked about today. So, maybe we do a part&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:36:55.920 --> 03:37:00.399
three of your testimony and we can take questions&nbsp;
from people and and maybe dive a little bit deeper&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:37:00.399 --> 03:37:04.960
into some of the stuff that we talked about&nbsp;
towards the end. Um, and then we can plan an&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:37:04.960 --> 03:37:11.520
episode to do a biblical deep dive too and sort&nbsp;
of uncover what our eyes haven't seen, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:37:11.520 --> 03:37:16.560
or what most people haven't. And now that we have&nbsp;
sort of a renewed way that we look at the world,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:37:16.560 --> 03:37:20.399
um, it would be really interesting to do that and&nbsp;
maybe do some Q&amp;A for people who have questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:37:20.399 --> 03:37:27.679
for you. That would be awesome. I I would that&nbsp;
would be great. uh would be just a joy to talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:37:27.680 --> 03:37:33.120
about this because the more we understand it, the&nbsp;
more common we realize it is and the more people&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:42.800
can discover um the salvation uh that we really&nbsp;
need that has been so well hidden from us. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:37:42.800 --> 03:37:49.120
and maybe we could talk to a little bit about&nbsp;
um some children's games that were used uh in&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:37:49.120 --> 03:37:56.800
programming as well. Um, I'm not sure I have heard&nbsp;
not I, you know, I don't listen to a ton. Um, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:37:56.800 --> 03:38:04.319
I haven't I haven't heard uh how children's games&nbsp;
like Hungry Hippo, Trouble, and Sorry have been&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:38:04.319 --> 03:38:10.319
used in programming. They were used in mine. A&nbsp;
lot of these games were developed through military&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:38:10.319 --> 03:38:17.599
um veterans by military veterans. And so maybe&nbsp;
we could talk about um Hungry Hippo or I could&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:38:17.600 --> 03:38:24.239
call it I like to call it Hungry Hippo campus and&nbsp;
what it means to lose your marbles. Oh my gosh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:38:24.239 --> 03:38:29.599
what a pun. Holy smokes. Yes, that would be really&nbsp;
really valuable. Again, people are trying to move&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:38:29.600 --> 03:38:36.399
away from the things that they have access to&nbsp;
in real life, movies, music, um facilities,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:38:36.399 --> 03:38:40.879
businesses. I think this could be another way&nbsp;
too that we could educate parents, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:38:40.880 --> 03:38:45.760
and I think that would be really fascinating or&nbsp;
video games, you know, I think there's so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:38:45.760 --> 03:38:51.040
different ways that what you went through in this&nbsp;
actual program, you know, affects children that&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:38:51.040 --> 03:38:56.319
are outside of it in the real life. They've&nbsp;
they've duplicated that in actual, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:38:56.319 --> 03:39:01.359
society, too. A lot of these things. So, it'd be&nbsp;
really good to spend some time going through some&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:39:01.359 --> 03:39:05.839
of that and helping shine a light on, you know,&nbsp;
for survivors, too, who might have gone through&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:39:05.840 --> 03:39:10.720
that and might not remember or might not be clear&nbsp;
or might have not not have talked about it yet. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:39:10.720 --> 03:39:16.239
actually haven't heard of these games being used.&nbsp;
So, it would be a new topic for for listeners as&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:39:16.239 --> 03:39:21.120
well to to hear about and learn about. So, let's&nbsp;
definitely plan, you know, at least a couple more&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:39:21.120 --> 03:39:27.359
episodes and we can do some deep dives into&nbsp;
some of this stuff. Cool. Awesome. Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:39:27.359 --> 03:39:33.839
I appreciate today. I appreciate you. You shared&nbsp;
so much and so much of this was I know just like&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:39:33.840 --> 03:39:38.399
the hardest things in life to talk about, you&nbsp;
know, and the fact that you are able to bear your&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:39:38.399 --> 03:39:44.479
soul the way that you do, emotions and all exactly&nbsp;
authentic to who you are and to share it in a way&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:39:44.479 --> 03:39:49.919
that that the audience can be touched by it and&nbsp;
can hear the reality of these things. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:39:49.920 --> 03:39:57.279
the details of of your children to the details&nbsp;
of programming and locations and um you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:39:57.279 --> 03:40:01.840
how these things are are presented to our children&nbsp;
in the form of books and entertainment, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:40:01.840 --> 03:40:10.239
and I just really appreciate your candid and&nbsp;
honest uh education that you give us on your&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:40:10.239 --> 03:40:17.920
experiences and on these things. And then I&nbsp;
also really appreciate you always always and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:40:17.920 --> 03:40:22.960
don't know if you do this I think you just do this&nbsp;
naturally but you the hardest things that you talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:40:22.960 --> 03:40:29.840
about by the end of it people feel hope you spin&nbsp;
things around to be very hopeful to be positive&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:40:29.840 --> 03:40:34.479
to have wisdom behind it lessons that we can learn&nbsp;
ways that we can keep going when we feel like we&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:40:34.479 --> 03:40:41.839
want to give up um and you do that in in in a way&nbsp;
that I think and wish that more people would would&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:40:41.840 --> 03:40:46.239
look at life, you know. So, I think the more that&nbsp;
that we sort of listen to these situations and how&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:40:46.239 --> 03:40:51.760
you and others have overcome them, you know, we're&nbsp;
giving people hope, too. So, I really appreciate&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:40:51.760 --> 03:40:57.520
you sharing all this and then also bringing up&nbsp;
shining the light on it in a way where we can take&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:40:57.520 --> 03:41:02.399
something meaningful away from it that can benefit&nbsp;
us, whether it's education or a tool for healing&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:41:02.399 --> 03:41:07.759
it. Um, you know, or just a different perspective&nbsp;
to look at how we can switch something like shame&nbsp;&nbsp;

03:41:07.760 --> 03:41:13.120
around, you know, and and and take away a positive&nbsp;
from it. So, thank you, Kadia, with all my heart&nbsp;&nbsp;
