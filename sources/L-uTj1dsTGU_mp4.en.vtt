[Music]

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.480
After over 5 years, we now bring you the second&nbsp;
video interview with James Casbolt. In bases 4,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.240
Casmolt expanded on Barry King's material,&nbsp;
first released in bases 1 and two. King talked&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.880
about generated life forms, horrendous&nbsp;
mind and population control programs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.920
mannequin and puppet master, all going on in&nbsp;
Britain's Barkshire countryside at a base under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.200
the village of Peasmore. Casbolt highlighted&nbsp;
even more horrific programs involving children,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.960
genetic experimentation, and further terrifying&nbsp;
details. And even a base under parliament itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.880
called CLC1. In bases two and four, a further&nbsp;
witness, Matt Todd, gave us even more detail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.640
with the involvement of the US military in&nbsp;
the abductions or myabs and how he killed four&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.760
grays at a base where people's souls were kept in&nbsp;
cages. Bases 7 gave a super soldier Dave Maro and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:16.240
his trauma-induced monarch programming. Selected&nbsp;
at birth and trained to fight off planet. Perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.000
M. Todd demonstrated radio signals coming from&nbsp;
his many implants. The existence of some other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.600
form of dimensional reality and a war with super&nbsp;
beings is implied. So now in bases 9, we present&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:38.240
Michael Prince aka James Casbolt. This time the SS&nbsp;
comes into focus and the nightmare continues. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:49.760
is if any of these claims can ever be proved with&nbsp;
factual evidential data. James Casbold. [Music]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:59.120
James, we met in a previous persona as James on&nbsp;
previous edition of u the basis. You've got a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.640
different persona now or you've got two different&nbsp;
um ways you portray yourself to the public. Can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.600
you explain what the difference is or why you've&nbsp;
changed or has there been a change? Michael Prince&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.120
James Castle. It's just a simple matter of I'm&nbsp;
using the name of my birth name Michael Prince.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.960
It's a name I was given at birth by my biological&nbsp;
mother. So, so where what's the story of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:34.880
Casbold story? Um, that was a family I was adopted&nbsp;
into the Casbolt family. Yeah. So um that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:44.640
um 81. Yeah. I need to go back to the beginning&nbsp;
when I was a baby. the origins of project Ibis. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:53.840
it was the name of the project I was um involved&nbsp;
in uh or born into effectively um was named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:05.120
project Ibis and it was run by the NSA and MI6&nbsp;
and um it was it was um tracking of 42 children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:13.680
from different countries and um all those children&nbsp;
were brought to a facility in Canada in the Rocky&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.920
Mountains um underneath a small town called Nelson&nbsp;
and what what countries why were they selected?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.520
Um, according to the file information I've seen,&nbsp;
they were se selected for cuz their DNA the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.960
um the NSA information I've seen um says&nbsp;
that we have what they call blood prime which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:46.000
um it states anunnaki DNA. What is blood prime?&nbsp;
What's what specifically are the differences? I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.360
think it's a type of alien DNA, human um alien&nbsp;
hybrid. Is there any particular recess negative,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.840
positive or anything like that? Um I think it&nbsp;
there's that the recess negative factor in it. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:09.600
think the the only negative factor. Yeah. So that&nbsp;
how are the ch children selected as such? I mean&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.800
does that mean there's some means of selecting&nbsp;
is it from different you know at birth other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:22.560
people's bloodline medical records I think the&nbsp;
mothers were um selected and um the embryos were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:30.800
cloned embryos grown in a artificial environment&nbsp;
um test tube babies and I think those from my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:40.320
understanding those um embryos were then implanted&nbsp;
into specific women who gave birth And then at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.920
time of birth, the children were transported to&nbsp;
the um underground facility in Nelson in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:53.040
The name of that facility was a Q552. Where's&nbsp;
Nelson? Is it in Matoma or Winnipeg somewhere?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:06.320
That's a small town in the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp;
It's inh British Columbia in Canada. um that

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:13.920
so we were all taken there at the time of birth.&nbsp;
Some some from America, I think. Um there was some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:21.120
from South America obviously, some from the&nbsp;
UK. Um I don't know who the other 42 children&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.240
are. I've got a rough idea now. Why 42? I don't&nbsp;
know. Is it just just that's what the sample was?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.120
There's no significance in it. I don't know.&nbsp;
I'm sure there's significance in it somewhere,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.360
but I don't have that information. Many of the&nbsp;
children were transported on private CIA jets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:50.000
small small jets or just just like Leah jets.&nbsp;
Yeah. And um transported there. Um so what's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.760
program? What specifically is the purpose of it?&nbsp;
There's a lot of effort being put into this then.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.240
Why? Um project IBIS is again the Nazi connection.&nbsp;
The name comes from the um the Giza Intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:07.440
Group underneath the Giza pyramids, the Nazi group&nbsp;
in World War II. What Nazi group is this? Um it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.760
known as the Giza Intelligence. The Nazi group.&nbsp;
Which part of the Giza plateau were they involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.680
with? I don't know. I just know they were um based&nbsp;
underneath the Giza pyramids. It was a facility,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:27.520
the Nazis in World War II. And um the name&nbsp;
connects to Thoth, the um the immortal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:37.520
the Egyptian. His um some connection with an ibis&nbsp;
bird would represent Thoth in Egypt. Now what are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.080
they were they trying to find in Egypt or what&nbsp;
did they find in Egypt? I think they found some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.680
kind of life extension technology and this was&nbsp;
effectively that this was a major part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.800
IBIS program was life extension regeneration.&nbsp;
Is there is there some kind of chamber that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:59.040
could mention or any any particular area? Yeah,&nbsp;
there's the emerald chambers. The emerald the or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:08.400
the emerald rooms, but I think that is that's in&nbsp;
more than one location. Um I'd rather not talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:17.520
too much about the emerald rooms. I'd rather just&nbsp;
focus um because it's such a complex subject. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.640
um is this to do with the storage of souls on&nbsp;
the earth and the recreation on earth? This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:34.320
very much physical um this is they at the um Q552&nbsp;
we were being indoctrinated with Nazi principles&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:41.920
um Germanic principles um were you indoctrinated&nbsp;
by Nazis? Yeah, it was Nazi. It wasn't just Nazis&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.760
there, but there was a big Nazi presence. Um, some&nbsp;
of the philosophies were indoctrinated with there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.440
Um, you see those philosophies in um, Germanic&nbsp;
organizations to this day like the Odinist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.000
Fellowship in this country. Um, the philosophies&nbsp;
are based around obviously the creation of an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:09.280
Uber man, a superman. But, um, they see life on&nbsp;
Earth as a means to an end. They're not trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:14.720
to get somewhere else. They're not trying to get&nbsp;
to heaven or another planet. They want to become&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:23.520
physically immortal in this body on this earth&nbsp;
and stay here. Now um we're also indoctrinated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:31.280
with the the Germanic belief in um endless&nbsp;
warfare. Um is that would be our reality once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:39.920
we stayed here physically. We um our reality would&nbsp;
be endless warfare and there'd be periods of rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:46.160
You need to maybe reorganize the the logistics&nbsp;
or um they talked about the thousand-year Reich,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:54.720
a thousand years of peace. Um which would be&nbsp;
periods of rest in between the warfare and then it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:02.160
would just be a continuous cycle. And um that was&nbsp;
effectively um how they had indoctrinated us to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.160
be assassins when we were older so we could keep&nbsp;
functioning. If we were concerned about the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:15.680
um hit and had anxiety about that we wouldn't&nbsp;
be able to carry out and function. But if in our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:22.080
mindset if we believe that we were designed&nbsp;
for endless warfare and it would never stop&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:30.800
um we would just accept that and be able and be&nbsp;
relaxed when we were involved in assassination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:39.680
Now what kind of assassination or what kind of&nbsp;
missions are we are we talking about here? Um

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:51.760
this is in numerous countries. um many different&nbsp;
ways. So it's it's um is it I mean we are we sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.640
of going and doing a one two three bump somebody&nbsp;
off or or just just that different types of of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:05.600
assassination? Um a lot of it was standard um&nbsp;
gunplay. Um I mean that that came later on down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:12.160
the road obviously we were actually raised&nbsp;
in this facility as babies. So from 1976 to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:19.760
1979 we were raised in this base. Um the where&nbsp;
it was in the mountains um it was underground&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.920
but there was um it was above ground the main&nbsp;
entrance. It was like an aircraft hanger and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.160
um what kind of general area are we talking&nbsp;
about? What can you describe in it? It's in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:36.240
the mountains. It's um it's a very private&nbsp;
location near Nelson. Just near Nelson in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:44.080
the mountains. Would there be a mountain&nbsp;
name you could name? It's near I think it

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.240
I'm not sure the mountain name. I know that&nbsp;
there's a um a logging compound nearby and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:56.720
there's an old um access route near the logging&nbsp;
compound that actually takes you to the base in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:08.080
the mountain and Nelson's a very small town. Um&nbsp;
again the above ground um section of it was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:17.040
aircraft hanger and um when we were first brought&nbsp;
there as B is it a is it got a runway and landing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:24.960
place or um it's fenced off high fences and&nbsp;
um it has yeah it has a runway in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:32.160
the aircraft hanger if you come in but the um the&nbsp;
aircraft hanger sits or fenced around the runways&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:40.000
here and the aircraft hangers here. Yeah, it's&nbsp;
quite a big building. Um but as babies we were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.160
um we slept in the aircraft hanger often&nbsp;
because um it was essentially a trauma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:52.160
center. So they wanted us to be exposed to the&nbsp;
cold and there was um sets of cops in there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.160 --> 00:12:01.200
So this is high up I mean a couple of thousand&nbsp;
feet up high the Rocky Mountain very high. Um

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:11.760
it's near B National Park right where um so they&nbsp;
we were kind of being exposed to the elements&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.560
essentially. We slept there um in the aircraft&nbsp;
hang with the doors open and there was rows of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:25.120
CS and we were under 24-hour armed guard all&nbsp;
at all times. So we couldn't be rescued from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:31.120
that facility because there were factions there&nbsp;
that would rescue us at the first opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:39.600
The people that like the parents or or the well&nbsp;
special forces groups um people that guarded us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:51.920
were they wore um they wore black uniforms. um&nbsp;
some and they wore black masks, but sometimes they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.920 --> 00:13:02.160
wore the um ultramodern SS uniform, which what?&nbsp;
It's um it's kind of like your standard SAS Black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:12.240
Ops uniform. Um it's black boots, black trousers,&nbsp;
black top, but the um it has chest plates and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:26.400
there's leather around the arms and it has the&nbsp;
um SS double rune. Yeah. The the SS symbol. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.120
um so that's a modern uniform. When you're saying&nbsp;
a modern uniform, you're talking about post World&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:38.640
War II. Yeah. This is the the the modern SS&nbsp;
uniform. So getting back to this SS uniform,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:44.320
I think what era are we talking about? '7s.&nbsp;
This was 1976 and we were first taken there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:50.800
as babies. So that means that the that's the SS&nbsp;
wearing those uniforms in Canada. So they must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:59.280
have authority to do so. um there was some kind of&nbsp;
internal war going on in the military and in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:06.560
intelligence community. So is this this is um are&nbsp;
you saying this is therefore a Nazi organization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:16.720
that's that's doing this? Um yeah. Yeah. So by by&nbsp;
inference it means that the connections with AL499&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:23.040
and the other places in the UK must be essentially&nbsp;
under Nazi control or is that NSA control? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:29.520
this is it. You see, there's a big Nazi element&nbsp;
within the NSA because this was a officially an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:42.000
NSA facility, the Q552 at Nelson. This was a NSA&nbsp;
base officially, the Q552 facility at Nelson. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:48.880
um, there's a there's a major Nazi element within&nbsp;
the NSA. So, that essentially is saying that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:55.360
NSA is a Nazi organization and a survivor&nbsp;
organization from World War II. Um, yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:04.240
I'd say that's a fairly accurate statement. So, de&nbsp;
facto World War II was won by the by the Nazis. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:12.240
wouldn't say they won, but I wouldn't say they&nbsp;
lost either. It survived. Survived. Yeah. In&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:19.520
an underground fashion. If the NSA is essentially&nbsp;
protecting the Nazis or the Nazis are running the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:27.200
NSA. Yeah. Is is that what you're you're saying?&nbsp;
Um I'd say that the Nazis faction is running MI6.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:37.840
Um just to go off topic slightly before I carry&nbsp;
on about what happened at the AL um Q552. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:48.800
my main contact in MI6, um, he's a director of&nbsp;
special operations, a man named Alfred Bonner. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.600
is this your current contact or was your contact?&nbsp;
He's been my contact for years and he's my current&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:53.600 --> 00:16:01.680
contact. I've carried out many assassinations&nbsp;
under his instructions. Um, so you're saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:10.080
this publicly? Is this um he's not he's not&nbsp;
publicly known but people can contact MI6 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:16.640
ask to speak to director Bonner you can contact&nbsp;
MI6 on the website the phone number and MI6 will&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:21.920
admit they do have a director Bonner there so&nbsp;
what is the function of of telling us about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.880
this now is are they inviting people to to ask&nbsp;
those questions or do they want that information&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:34.080
out they want this information out they want this&nbsp;
information out um Alfred Bonner he's from Bavaria&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:43.840
um in German effectively. He's um he you see him&nbsp;
very interesting looking man. Um you your classic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:58.800
Aryan giant. The guy's 6'6. Um looks about&nbsp;
52. Huge guy. Yeah. Massive shoulders. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:06.960
very blonde hair going almost white now cuz he's&nbsp;
getting a bit older. Um, wears your classic MIB&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:15.120
outfit. The fedora hat. That's his style of dress.&nbsp;
Where's the fedora hat, black suit, um, piercing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:22.240
blue eyes, has a scar down his left side. That's&nbsp;
from the officer class from fighting. I'm not sure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:28.320
where he got the scar. Um, this guy amazing guy.&nbsp;
It's a characteristic of German upper class used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:34.080
to have a a scar. That's interesting. From sword&nbsp;
fighting. It's interesting you say that. I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:41.840
know that. Um, very interesting character. He um&nbsp;
from Bavaria, close friends with Henry Kissinger&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:47.360
or Henry Kisser also from Bavaria. He seems to&nbsp;
have an amazing ability to stay young and healthy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:54.320
relatively speaking. Um, Alfred Bonner was the&nbsp;
director of uh, security at Dulce at the time&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.920
of the Doulie rescue. And now there's been a book&nbsp;
published by Pilington, I think it is. Um, I could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.560
start correcting saying the whole Dolce thing&nbsp;
is a fraud. They've stuck bits on the mountain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:10.880
to make it look as if what's going on. No, Duly is&nbsp;
real. Dolce is 100% there. So, I mean, why do you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:16.960
think there'd be elements within MI5 publishing&nbsp;
books, saying this stuff's wrong and it's shadows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:23.600
and it's it's a it's a wrong? I'm not really&nbsp;
interested in the whole recent book has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:29.680
published. Um, you know, I'm not really interested&nbsp;
in all that. It's I know it's Dulce is real. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:36.720
um it's a important place for the new world order.&nbsp;
So, what's what's the function of Dulce? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:43.120
we've heard certain underground things that which&nbsp;
were released in the late '7s. Is there anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:50.800
new about it? Is it current? I don't I've got a&nbsp;
friend um in the CIA works at Oakidge National&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.800 --> 00:19:00.880
Laboratories in Tennessee and he often works&nbsp;
down at Dulce. Um I mean he sent me pictures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:06.160
of the first level got color photographs and&nbsp;
it's not really the first level isn't high tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:12.800
It's kind of just a damp old base, you know, like&nbsp;
sort of it's a bit run down the first level. Not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:17.440
what you'd expect to see at all. The old elevator&nbsp;
shafts and things. Are you able to provide those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:22.400
pictures at all? Yeah, I can. I've um I think they&nbsp;
were released on Project Avalon a couple of years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:29.760
back, right? I can show you those pictures. Um,&nbsp;
you know, but when you go down the levels, it does&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:36.880
get more advanced down there. It's a essentially&nbsp;
um Have you been down to those levels or have you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:45.280
been shown them? Um there is connections with um&nbsp;
IBS and Dulce Douli is essentially a um officially&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:55.040
it's a psychiatry center. Um they when the um&nbsp;
employees walk around the facility, there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:01.520
certain sections with um people in like hospital&nbsp;
rooms with um almost like prison rooms in a way,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:07.680
but not with bars, like um plastic windows,&nbsp;
you know, thick plastic and uh you know, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:15.280
have people there in hospital gowns and um sitting&nbsp;
on their beds and it it the the briefing is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:23.520
they're um incurably insane. pain and that they're&nbsp;
doing high-risk um drug treatments on the insane&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:29.680
and it's actually a top secret um psychiatry&nbsp;
facility. That's what they're first told when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:39.280
they go in there. So uh and then they they never&nbsp;
come out these people. Yeah. Um I think a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:46.480
them don't come out. There's um as you go the hall&nbsp;
these particular hallways um at Dulce these rooms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:54.320
in um the corridor curved round and every kind&nbsp;
of 12 rooms you have an operating theater. These&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:54.320 --> 00:21:02.880
people taken out as operating theaters there.&nbsp;
And uh the Q552 facility in Canada in Nelson was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:11.200
um there was a lot of uh Nazi psychiatry um&nbsp;
conditioning going on there. What sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:19.360
what are you talking about conditioning? Well,&nbsp;
for instance um at the facility they were um it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.640
was essentially a trauma center. Now they did a&nbsp;
lot of conditioning with us with wild animals and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:30.000
what they were doing there they they used um&nbsp;
Canadian wolves, they used snakes, they used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:42.320
um cats, wild cats and tigers and things. Um they&nbsp;
were giving us the attributes of wild animals. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:49.600
they were subjecting us to um um for when we were&nbsp;
older um for all terrain warfare, jungle warfare,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:55.280
artic warfare. So we had the attributes of wild&nbsp;
animals. How do you get the attribute of a wild&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:04.880
animal? They used um they set up I think it was&nbsp;
a second level down at the Q552. Um they set up a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:18.960
kind of pen um about 30 ft 30 ft wide. Um they set&nbsp;
up a this pen they put the babies in the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:25.760
um they put wild animals in the pen. They might&nbsp;
put snakes in there or you know wolves. Only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.920
one type of animal at a time. They didn't&nbsp;
mix the animals. It was always one type.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:38.080
Now this um pen was very similar to a Skinner box&nbsp;
they use in psychiatry. Skinner box. A Skinner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:46.400
box is um famous psychiatrist Skinner. I forget&nbsp;
his first name. Um he would he designed this box&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.400
and he they put babies in it and they put animals&nbsp;
in with the babies and they were doing cognitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:52.400 --> 00:23:03.600
behavior test. See, now the babies would react to&nbsp;
the animals and um they would in this partic this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:12.880
this particular device um they put us in there and&nbsp;
they set up screens in the corners of the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:23.200
uh people's the people's faces would be put on&nbsp;
the screens um enlarged and uh the faces would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:30.560
call us and get our attention. We'd look and the&nbsp;
faces would start talking to us people and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:41.920
uh the faces would look like they were um changing&nbsp;
into uh half human, half whatever the animal was.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:47.920
So if it was a snake, if they were putting snakes&nbsp;
in the pen, this the the person talking would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:56.960
um start talking to us and then his face would&nbsp;
change into half human, half snake lizard and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:07.680
um they George Bush senior was the main um&nbsp;
handler of that particular uh facility and um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:13.680
his face would often come on the screen and talk&nbsp;
to us and He would do the very much the rep the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:19.360
reptile with the snakes. That would be his area.&nbsp;
Was that something that was done on a recorded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:24.800
type of a level or was it he did it personally?&nbsp;
He was on the screen. I'm not sure if he was that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:30.480
he was there sometimes physically but I mean the&nbsp;
guy travels all around the world to all different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.840
bases. He's a major programmer so I don't know he&nbsp;
could have been over the other side of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:41.760
Um and he would come on and um Is this something&nbsp;
that you experienced directly? This Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:46.480
I I saw him. He used to talk to us, talk to me.&nbsp;
And u And what age were you when this happened?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:53.120
I was this was 76. I was a baby. Yeah. And this,&nbsp;
you know, this carried on. I spent from 76 to 79&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:53.120 --> 00:25:03.600
there and grew up there. Um the uh Queen Mother&nbsp;
as well, she was a programmer there. She would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:09.520
um her face would be flashed on the screen, but&nbsp;
her specialtity was wolves. Whenever they put the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:20.400
walls in with us, um she would come on and she'd&nbsp;
talk to us and um she would start to change into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:28.640
halfwoman, half wolf like face on the screen. Was&nbsp;
this done by some kind of electronic video effect&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:37.600
or I don't know. I don't know. Um, can you name&nbsp;
any other animals associated with different other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:45.920
people? Um, the only ones I remember is um George&nbsp;
Brcina with snakes and the queen mother with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:55.760
um wolves. It's the place was very dark. I'm still&nbsp;
starting to it's difficult to remember everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:04.800
that happened there. Still coming back in bits and&nbsp;
pieces. Um, I remember being put in the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:14.480
um toy the group of babies and um there were toys&nbsp;
put in and um one of the babies um took a toy off&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:22.640
another baby and the um the little baby turned&nbsp;
around and hissed at the other child like a snake&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:30.880
and his face sort of went like a snake. So we this&nbsp;
was absorbed into them psychologically. Yeah. Into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:48.240
their psyche. Yeah. And with the DNA anyway that&nbsp;
an anarchy DNA that the NSA were looking for.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.200
[Music] In part one, we heard how Michael&nbsp;
Prince is the birth name for James Casbolt&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:58.960
and how he was taken to a base in Canada near&nbsp;
the small mountain town of Nelson in British&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:06.320
Columbia for cyborg enhancement as mind control&nbsp;
children selected by their specific blood types&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:12.560
on how they were exposed to the open cold night&nbsp;
in a large aircraft style hanger to sort out the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:19.120
men from the boys just as in ancient Sparta.&nbsp;
then guarded by Nazi SS troops in modern tight&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.960
uniforms in the late 1970s. Michael sent this&nbsp;
scan of one of his security clearances. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:29.760
in earlier images he sent claiming to be at&nbsp;
the Dulce base, this could be anywhere. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:38.960
if anyone really knows what these forms refer&nbsp;
to, please contact melblue yonder.co.uk.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:43.920
What age were you when this happened? I was a This&nbsp;
was 76. I was a baby. Yeah. And this, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:54.720
this carried on. I spent from 76 to 79 there and&nbsp;
grew up there. Um the uh queen mother as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:59.920
she was a programmer there. She would um her&nbsp;
face would be flashed on the screen, but her&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:08.880
specialtity was wolves. whenever they put the&nbsp;
walls in with us, um, she would come on and she'd&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:18.720
talk to us and, um, she would start to change into&nbsp;
half woman, half wolf like face on the screen. Was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:28.240
this done by some kind of electronic video effect&nbsp;
or I don't know. I don't know. Um, can you name&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:36.320
any other animals associated with different other&nbsp;
people? Um, the only ones I remember is um George&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:46.240
Brcina with snakes and the queen mother with um&nbsp;
wolves. It's the place was very dark. I'm still&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.360
starting to It's difficult to remember everything&nbsp;
that happened there. It's still coming back in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:51.360 --> 00:29:02.080
bits and pieces. Um, I remember being put in&nbsp;
the pen and um toy this group of babies and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:10.560
um there were toys put in and um one of the&nbsp;
babies um took a toy off another baby and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:17.760
um the little baby turned around and hissed at the&nbsp;
other child like a snake and his face sort of went&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:25.520
like a snake. So weird that this was absorbed into&nbsp;
them psychologically or Yeah. into their psyche.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:32.720
Yeah. And with the DNA anyway, the Anunnaki DNA&nbsp;
that the NSA were looking for. So explain to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.280
the Anunnaki are I mean there's lots of different&nbsp;
versions or different things about the Anunnaki.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:48.400
What is this kind of Anunnaki or precisely&nbsp;
that I mean that term's banded around a lot. Um

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:57.360
our group was there were Germanic roots Aryan&nbsp;
roots which I would say connects to al deon in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:04.000
the plleades. So I think anunnaki I think is a&nbsp;
Sumerian word that just means visitors from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.320
stars or something like that. So I think&nbsp;
in our particular group our heritage was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.880
um I mean we discussed this before in the last&nbsp;
interview I think um you know it goes back to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:32.320
France, Germany, Bavaria, Greece in the Middle&nbsp;
East goes back and um does he do Egypt to Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:39.120
connections with Egypt? Yeah. The tribe of&nbsp;
Dan and Kaish. Yeah, definitely. So that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:49.280
this is a white race of a white Germanic well&nbsp;
Aryan race. And I don't mean just blondhaired.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:31:00.160
So we were we were being um conditioned every&nbsp;
day and um into what what function? Um assassins&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:06.960
mainly. assassins. Um there was, you know, there&nbsp;
psychic things, remote viewing and that, but it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:15.680
mainly assassins. Um physical soldiers, this is&nbsp;
why they wanted the all terrain attributes. Um so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:26.800
just basic soldiering, not basic soldiering, um&nbsp;
specific operations such as um crash retrieval,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:33.760
hunting, um tracking, aliens, what kind of crash&nbsp;
retrieval? um ships that were shot down from alien&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:39.920
creatures. So, you were specifically dealing with&nbsp;
the crashed retrieval of non-human craft. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:49.200
that came later. There was many of them um&nbsp;
tracking um alien entities through jungle terrain,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:56.400
desert terrains, almost smelling them, almost&nbsp;
picking up this scent like a even though to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.880
average person made these aliens would appear&nbsp;
human. Uh would you would you There was all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:07.680
different types. We trapped all different types.&nbsp;
There was a wolf type of being a bipedal humanoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:16.000
wolf that like a Bigfoot. We trapped those&nbsp;
creatures. So we trapped those. Were they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.520
they people indigenous to Earth or were they um&nbsp;
were they walking like through the dimensional or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.560
No, these were physical creatures that physically&nbsp;
traveled in ships. There was a landing zone in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:32.080
um there was an NSA facility on the island of&nbsp;
Panang. dense um the looking glass facility,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:38.320
dense jungle coverage, um regular physical&nbsp;
landing, the ships will come down there. Some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.120
of these wolf beings. Did you ever see the the&nbsp;
ships or uh Yeah. Yeah, I saw the ships that came&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:51.680
later in the early '8s. Um if I just can stick&nbsp;
to this what happened in Canada and um so we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:58.400
being conditioned there and um essentially&nbsp;
being tortured. It was a trauma center. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:02.800
um, how did the conditioning function? What&nbsp;
happened when you were conditioned? What was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:14.080
done? Um, well, they terrorize us. They'd um&nbsp;
I remember um they'd the guards, these S SS um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:25.840
uniform guys would um they they brought a a huge&nbsp;
snake into the um pen one day and I think this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:31.120
was some kind of anaconda from South America. You&nbsp;
know, it took like three or four of them to carry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:39.360
it in. This was huge. They put that in and uh I&nbsp;
remember a young young girl there was involved in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:52.720
the program in something about 18 years old and&nbsp;
um they fed someone to the snake in front of us

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:59.680
alive. Yeah. Yeah. It's difficult to for me&nbsp;
to look at the memory and look at the person,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:07.680
but I know someone was in the same way that&nbsp;
we'd feed their live rats to snakes. Yeah. Watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:18.960
live mice. Yeah. Yeah. And was this what was the&nbsp;
function of this? Um I think they break us down,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:28.320
terrorize us to control us. I saw a lot&nbsp;
of that stuff. saw a lot of um people and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:38.720
um later on I saw a young girl thrown in a cage&nbsp;
with a wolf and um like torn to pieces and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:48.720
was that was in England later on. Um what&nbsp;
part of England? Barkshire. Barkshire A499.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:35:00.720
it. We had to be under armed guard 24 hours&nbsp;
a day at the Q552 um because it was um there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:04.880
was groups apparently that wanted to rescue us&nbsp;
from that cuz it's not you know if you didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:12.640
know that did you find out later. Yeah. Um&nbsp;
so they're not definitely not all powerful&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:20.640
or anything like that. Definitely. It wasn't&nbsp;
like a um impenetrable facility. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:26.000
a lot of these facilities aren't. You can get&nbsp;
in them if you really want. Yeah. Um and boss&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:36.080
people out if you really want. Um we were we got&nbsp;
to 1979 now and we've been raised there for those&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:44.960
years between 76 and 79. And um we were all um&nbsp;
put in SUVs, convoy of them to be driven down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:53.760
to another base in America. Uh Dulce Dica. Yeah.&nbsp;
Being driven transported down to there in a in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:53.760 --> 00:36:01.600
convoy. And um I remember we hadn't got that&nbsp;
far out the base. I think we're still in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:13.520
mountains and the helicopter seemed to come out&nbsp;
of nowhere. um small small special forces group um

00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:21.600
came out and there was a shootout and um some&nbsp;
of the guards shot the children. Some of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:27.440
SS guards shot the children before they could be&nbsp;
rescued. some of their children, but most of us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:36.800
were um rescued and we were brought to a building&nbsp;
in Toronto, like a um just it was large building,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:40.960
a skyscraper. Yeah. We were brought there&nbsp;
to an underground car park there and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:50.480
top level of the facility was um near Young&nbsp;
Street or I don't know where it was. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:55.760
I've got I could try and find out, but I'm not&nbsp;
exactly sure. But I know it was in Toronto and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:05.040
um we were mean Toronto or I don't I know the&nbsp;
area that well. I just know it was um there was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:14.320
a lot of skyscrapers there and this was uh one&nbsp;
very tall building. Um we're in the top level of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:21.600
the building. you look out across the whole area&nbsp;
in it and um how many of them were you were you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:27.360
um that when we got to the um building in&nbsp;
Toronto and we we stayed there for a few&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:38.000
weeks I remember sitting in a room we used to&nbsp;
sit in classrooms together there um 15 20 of us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.680
yeah about that so the the group that rescued&nbsp;
us were based around com 12 uh in Majestic

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:50.720
What's COM 12? COM 12 is a group&nbsp;
centered around US naval intelligence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:57.760
but it's actually a majestic group. Um, the&nbsp;
I'm I'm in contact with one of the men who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:11.040
rescued us in America in 79, but I can't say&nbsp;
too much about him at the moment. Right. Um,

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:20.880
again another Germanic character. We're seeing&nbsp;
really that this Nazi control Germanic control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:28.400
is is very much in in control or are they&nbsp;
tolerated within the organization? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.120
there's good there's good and bad in this faction.&nbsp;
I mean, there's this there's a whole Germanic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:41.680
faction which um fighting against the people doing&nbsp;
all this evil in the So what do what do we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:48.720
that what are the two basic good guys bad guys&nbsp;
okay that who are the bad guys so to speak and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:53.200
what is their aim and what's their function&nbsp;
and what's the purpose of all I can't simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:53.200 --> 00:39:02.160
separate into two factions we don't um we we run&nbsp;
on survival dynamics what I mean by that is we we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.960
it's about the survival of ourselves survivors&nbsp;
of our families survival of the organization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:15.040
ations we work in in our race. Um that's how we&nbsp;
can understand. We don't believe in good or bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:22.080
So ultimately the good and bad side is essentially&nbsp;
you're surviving. It's us surviving but then it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:30.080
not just us surviving. We work on all the survival&nbsp;
dynamics. Whereas if um we if a person is abusing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:35.200
children they're working against the survival&nbsp;
dynamics. They're our enemy. Right? So this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:42.240
how we can operate. But we have to have lines and&nbsp;
boundaries or else we we we won't know who's who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:50.880
and we won't feel righteous and justified to take&nbsp;
military action which we do on a regular basis.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:56.160
We went through operations there. There were&nbsp;
surgeons there and um what was the function&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:03.280
of those because they um the surgeons cut&nbsp;
us open and found um cybernetics inside us.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:19.440
Um so they'd at the Q552 they'd slowly been&nbsp;
um cybernating us through with surgery and um

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:27.680
essentially creating a cyborg soldier. Now, um&nbsp;
these the surgeons at the the um place in Toronto,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:34.000
they they cut us open and apparently they&nbsp;
they were like, "What a mess." You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.000
this is and they tried and they were thinking&nbsp;
about trying to remove it. But then it it turned&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.600
out that this um technology would integrated into&nbsp;
us. It couldn't be removed. It was actually a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:54.560
natural part of our bodies. Now um this can is&nbsp;
it detectable in any way? Um, I'm sure it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:54.560 --> 00:41:01.280
I'm sure it is. All right. So, are you saying that&nbsp;
we could somehow if we booked the relevant place,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:05.360
we could check out your cyborgs? If you went&nbsp;
to one of those scanners in the airports,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:10.560
would they see it? Um, you know, the new&nbsp;
scanners. Yeah, that's interesting. Apparently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:18.960
um, the bone is a type of metal that um I'm not&nbsp;
a scientist, but it's something to do with being&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:26.160
off the periodical chart. It's not a um a metal&nbsp;
that's known to man, so it won't set off standard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:31.520
metal detectors. I've been told the closest um&nbsp;
thing we can compare it to on this planet is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:42.720
is a mixture of gold and diamond. It's extremely&nbsp;
hard. So I um So you don't know how that how that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:49.600
works technically. Um there's apparently&nbsp;
that that's the the bone and then there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:49.600 --> 00:42:04.400
um a small layer of kind of mechanical armor built&nbsp;
around that bone to reinforce it further. And um

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:12.720
is it got a grown? Apparently that is put in by&nbsp;
some uh it's nanotechnology. this all mechanical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:19.200
armor around the bone. The bone itself is&nbsp;
apparently metal. This type of metal and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:27.200
um it's built in nanotechnology that&nbsp;
is apparently they put some like worms&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:32.480
or something in you metallic worms and&nbsp;
they lay eggs something like that and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.200
it it builds it. Is there a process&nbsp;
name there? there was any kind of I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:48.320
think it's connected to the pro name of the&nbsp;
Osiris program um the Proteus program um

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.080
right is there anywhere we could look that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:58.880
up is there any documentation we&nbsp;
could look at that not really no

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:07.600
um I mean I've got I've got information from&nbsp;
NSA databases is but it's not documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:12.400
Yeah. So this stuff you could look up on the&nbsp;
internet as such. This is this stuff's never&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:19.920
been talked about again. They they they're slowly&nbsp;
cybernating these soldiers. What's the program&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:25.600
name involved with that or where is it happening?&nbsp;
How's it happening in other facilities? He started&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:38.960
um the umbrella project of Ibis with numerous&nbsp;
projects in that umbrella including mannequin. Um

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.040
so yeah they wanted to these surgeons wanted&nbsp;
to remove it cuz they didn't understand it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.720
So by removing it would it cause more damage&nbsp;
so they have to leave it. This is stuff had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:53.440
integrated into us. So they actually classified a&nbsp;
new life form. The scientists after that they they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:53.440 --> 00:44:00.640
um classified us they they called it ascended we&nbsp;
were ascended machine technology. Ascended machine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:09.280
machine technology um essentially a cyborg with a&nbsp;
soul and they developed a new law um of robotics&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:18.240
around us a new science around us. Does this&nbsp;
develop onto the secret soldier program? Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:24.080
because they wanted to do things like they wanted&nbsp;
to uh jump out of a plane without a parachute and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:31.520
land in the jungle in the sea or in the jungle,&nbsp;
run 40 miles through the jungle and then um take&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:37.680
out your target and be picked up. Are you able&nbsp;
to develop anything more on on that story? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:44.240
this I mean this came later, all these operations.&nbsp;
Um what do you mean by later in the 80s? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:51.520
there's so many. I mean, the operation in&nbsp;
Malaysia, for instance, that was a jungle&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:51.520 --> 00:45:01.520
warfare operation. Which operation in Malaysia?&nbsp;
In Malaysia on the island of Panang. This was um

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:11.760
and on what grounds and what type of&nbsp;
military action are you talking about? um the

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:18.080
lethal action assassinations where we're&nbsp;
having to take the fight to them. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:22.320
who is them? Where would they be? Well, okay.&nbsp;
You're going to you want you you want names?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:33.680
So you want something? Okay. We 2007 myself&nbsp;
and another individual um drove up to London.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:49.440
Um we travel to South London. Um around&nbsp;
the elephant and castle area. Now, um we

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:56.160
a an SUV pulled up with um MI6 operatives&nbsp;
in there. We were given a briefcase. Um the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:02.880
briefcase had the pistol that I've used for&nbsp;
years um for assassinations, which is a 9 mm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:09.360
Smith and Wesson with a pearl handle and has a&nbsp;
symbol of a black dragon on the handle. And I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:22.400
I call that gun Drago. And um we were given that&nbsp;
briefcase with that um pistol. There were these um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:31.840
small devices in there cubes which um kind of&nbsp;
artifact very old pieces of hardware. Um what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:36.160
do you mean by old? You talking about ancient&nbsp;
technology? I think it's Egyptian connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:44.800
Maybe thousands of years maybe older. Very old.&nbsp;
um what's like little puzzle boxes, small cubes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:50.880
a bit like a Rubik's cube, bit of metal around&nbsp;
the side and engravings and they're they're simply&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:56.320
you you hold them in front of your certain energy&nbsp;
centers and you can focus your brain waves through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:56.320 --> 00:47:06.000
them. So yeah, if you have um so are you saying&nbsp;
that the handles of the gum or the the crystals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.880
are have a signature to use so you can only&nbsp;
use it? Yeah, that's right. The um Drago only&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:18.640
I can use. I mean Dre Drago has alien technology&nbsp;
incorporated into it has special types of bullets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:24.800
that have been So it's not it's an ordinary bang&nbsp;
bang gun. No, it has um special type of bullets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:31.040
that have engravings on them on the bullets&nbsp;
and a special type of metal because when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:39.440
um So you are shooting a a different type of&nbsp;
being. Um, if you not shooting an old person,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:47.440
if if you're going to shoot an enhanced soldier or&nbsp;
intelligence operative, a Glock 17 is not going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:55.600
do it. I mean, it's the the the the chest plates&nbsp;
reinforced. The slug won't go through it or the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:55.600 --> 00:48:01.280
um organs are protected. So, is the bullet&nbsp;
essentially got a form of nanotechnology on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:09.040
it that breaks the structure of whatever&nbsp;
it's hitting? I think so. And there's um

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:19.840
there's some occult um aspect to this with the&nbsp;
engravings on they're um apparently these bullets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:26.000
are blessed but it's something to do with the&nbsp;
Vatican and they um this is brings a new meaning&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:33.920
to the term Vatican assassin. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so&nbsp;
is it designed to go through some kind of psychic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:38.080
shielding of some description? It's both. It's&nbsp;
physical and the psychic sort of go right through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:45.200
some kind of thought based force field. Yeah,&nbsp;
exactly. And that's where the engrave ends and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:54.080
they're blessed by the Vatican. It's nice to know&nbsp;
the Vatican are blessing us both other beings. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:54.080 --> 00:49:00.000
so you would so that by definition are you saying&nbsp;
that the reason why you guys have been modified&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:06.080
bone into being is because these other enhanced&nbsp;
beings are running around the place or land or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.960
alien or extradimensional beings or what? The&nbsp;
these are the same terrestrial. No, these are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:17.840
the same human cyborgs. Um the same people&nbsp;
who are raised in these bases. These are our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:26.480
counterparts. We're all the same team. So you're&nbsp;
essentially these are our dark counterparts who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:33.760
we're waring against and that's because they've&nbsp;
been programmed by them by these SS people. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:39.360
we've all been programmed by the SS people but we&nbsp;
managed to bust out of it but you didn't. That's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:44.000
the difference. So they've had their programming&nbsp;
fully enhanced to a certain level and then you've&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:50.640
had your programming enhanced to to try to to to&nbsp;
destroy these other people. Basically, it's an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:58.480
internal war. Yeah. And when we um the particular&nbsp;
guy we assassinated on that night, his name was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:05.760
um was Dixon Ramy, not his real name, top um&nbsp;
MI6 operative. I think we got Yeah, you wanted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:12.240
to know some of the details about this internal&nbsp;
assassin war. Um Dixon Ramy, not his real name.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:23.040
um an MI6 mind control handler was my handler&nbsp;
in the early '9s and um the handler of many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:33.200
prostitutes, many mind control prostitutes. Um&nbsp;
he we we we arrived at his house in South London,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:42.240
myself and another man. And um I walked up the&nbsp;
pathway, knocked on the door, a woman answered it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:50.160
prostitute, MI6 prostitute he was living with&nbsp;
at the time, and I used a cube to control her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.800
And can you describe these cubes to the size of&nbsp;
Rubik's cubes? Bit bigger than a Rubik's cube.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:04.000
That's quite big. But yeah, um you just hold it in&nbsp;
front of your this energy center here. Just hold&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:12.080
it. Simple. And then you just talk to them cuz&nbsp;
they connect with a cranial implant. So you just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:19.440
say, "Okay, let me in. Sit in the front room.&nbsp;
Sit down on the sofa." Um he was in the Where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:24.640
do you store down? Well, I just you hel you hold&nbsp;
it in front of you like that with two hands. See&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:32.720
how that and it's just a matter of talking, giving&nbsp;
commands and um yeah, sit on the sofa. Remy was in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:41.040
the toilet at the time. Um the cube had already&nbsp;
started to make him submissive when I was in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:47.200
the house. So, he just came out the toilet in half&nbsp;
trance. Anyway, I just told him to go upstairs and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:53.440
wait in the bedroom. and uh he just went upstairs&nbsp;
and just sat on the bed and waited for me. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:53.440 --> 00:52:03.040
um he had a bar there in the front room, you&nbsp;
know, uh and I got the woman to sit down. I got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:13.760
her to pour us a drink. We sat down and um I we&nbsp;
were looking for pearls. When I say pearls, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:22.640
an NSA code name for a suitcase nuclear weapon. Um&nbsp;
he'd stolen the suitcase nuke and um been careless&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:33.120
or something. Well, that's what got him shot. And&nbsp;
um you then shot him. So I interrogated the woman&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:40.080
about the location. Turns out that this thing's on&nbsp;
a boat, certain boat in a certain location. Once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:48.720
I got the location of the the pearl, the suitcase&nbsp;
nuke is on the river ts. No, it's in an ocean on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:58.960
a boat on a yacht. I won't give the names of the&nbsp;
place in the yacht. Um he I had a little radio.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:08.720
I called my associate in and we went upstairs and&nbsp;
um he put a pillowcase over Amy's head and then I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.880
shot him in the face seven times with a with with&nbsp;
your with the pistol. With the pistol with the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:22.560
special bullets. Yeah. Is that because he needed&nbsp;
the special bullets? That was my MMO, Miles. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:32.640
several shots to the face um on many targets. That&nbsp;
was Is that to to disable the brain functions if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:38.400
in the event of it being a manurion that could&nbsp;
continue functioning with one shot to maybe the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:47.040
other part of the body? uh they don't want them&nbsp;
to regenerate and also um they want to destroy the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:54.640
evidence of the um cranial implants. Yeah, they&nbsp;
have to destroy them for the autopsy in case the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:54.640 --> 00:54:01.760
autopsy went into hands that they can't control.&nbsp;
What is your primary function now in in talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:09.120
now? I'm still active. What's the main thing you&nbsp;
want to get across then? What's your what's your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:15.360
um people need to know this what's happening. They&nbsp;
need to give themselves a chance cuz things What&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:21.680
do you mean by giving themselves a chance? Well,&nbsp;
things are going to um speed up and increase or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:26.640
this this wall is underground now, but it's&nbsp;
going to burst onto the surface. It's going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:32.160
to burst into the streets, which it already is,&nbsp;
but that's going to Can you mention any suggest&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:39.040
any indications that which would illustrate that?&nbsp;
that's that things are bursting into the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:49.120
Um I I don't I won't give any examples now. Um but&nbsp;
people know what I mean in the next few years and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:54.640
um I just want to give people a chance. I mean&nbsp;
there are suggestions that uh we've been all been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:59.200
told that we've been programmed or led to believe&nbsp;
that you know 2012 is happening. There's going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:04.160
be catastrophic events. So there's a whole pile of&nbsp;
major global catastrophic events being programmed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:09.280
by the so-called Illuminati to illustrate this is&nbsp;
the end of the world and bang bang bang we're all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:14.480
going to die. You know the Japanese earthquake&nbsp;
that's that happened recently. Is that a is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:19.440
an example of that earthquake? Some people have&nbsp;
suggested it was a you know it was triggered&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.640
artificially or is that the kind of thing you're&nbsp;
talking about? Well, I was um in Nightsbridge at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:30.960
the time. Um and I was contacted um was just&nbsp;
around the corner from Buckingham Palace. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:39.280
was staying at Nightsbridge Hotel and um I was&nbsp;
contacted by MI6 the night before an official&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:46.320
um MI6 email address and um I was told tomorrow&nbsp;
it's going to be a terrorist attack and the guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:53.920
who contacted me said we wish we could stop it.&nbsp;
They called it a day of rage. And uh there were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:53.920 --> 00:56:00.640
a lot of YouTube susers saying there will be an&nbsp;
earthquake in Japan on Friday. And there was an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:06.800
earthquake in Japan on Friday. And I I I replied&nbsp;
back. I said to him, you know, it's it's another&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:13.520
another terrorist event. What do you want me to&nbsp;
do about it? And then the next day the the tsunami&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:20.960
happened in Japan. So it's not it's not a case of&nbsp;
all these disasters are coming. They're happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:28.400
that they made it happen. Um, yeah. I mean, I'm&nbsp;
not going to talk about the tsunami because it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:35.120
um there was a lot more in the tsunami. But&nbsp;
what I'll say about that and then I'll leave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:42.960
it at that is people need to um research the the&nbsp;
battle of the China Gates, Captain Mark Richards.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:48.880
What happened there with the earthquake? What what&nbsp;
that really was. The battle of the China battle of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:56.320
the China gates. When was that? When that was&nbsp;
in the late '7s and then the earthquake there&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:56.320 --> 00:57:04.160
in China killed huge amount of people. That's&nbsp;
that's all I'll say about that. I've given the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:12.960
name people can research that themselves.&nbsp;
Captain Mark Richards. Joanne Richards.

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:21.440
Yeah. The body can practically any wound can be&nbsp;
generated. you're essentially indestructible. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:28.240
it can regenerate pretty much any wound. Get your&nbsp;
arm blown off. They've got um multiple cloned body&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:33.920
parts of you, cloned organs, cloned legs, cloned&nbsp;
arms. I just reattach another arm. So, it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:40.480
it doesn't grow back? No, it doesn't grow back.&nbsp;
Uh, wounds can regenerate themselves. How quickly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:46.800
matter of hours? Uh, in seconds sometimes. Yeah.&nbsp;
And how is that done? Is that done with your own&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:54.560
power of your mind or it is enhanced? It's a&nbsp;
it's a kind of automatic process. So it's done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:54.560 --> 00:58:00.480
by the healing processes of the body naturally.&nbsp;
Yeah. It's almost a speeded up healing process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:08.160
Um but then if you suffer catastrophic wounds,&nbsp;
you get your legs blown off in Afghanistan. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:15.760
the ship you to hospital, they would they would&nbsp;
attach new legs. salt. Is that what the coma&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:21.440
hospitals are about? I think that was the early&nbsp;
experiments of that stuff, but they perfected it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:29.360
now. They don't need that. They only need body&nbsp;
parts from other humans for for every enhanced&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:35.680
soldier. They'll they'll have all these body parts&nbsp;
on ice and cry. Are they grown up grown or do they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:43.040
keep whole versions of you around? Um, no. I&nbsp;
mean, how did the practicalities of that work?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:49.440
I mean, I'm not a scientist or a geneticist,&nbsp;
but I know that they take your DNA and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:49.440 --> 00:59:10.520
they build the arm and then they just&nbsp;
keep it in cryo storage frozen. [Music]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:26.000
In part two, Prince described in 1979 how he&nbsp;
survived the rescue of enhanced cyber children as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:32.560
they were in convoy from the Canadian Nelson base&nbsp;
and then being taken to Toronto where an MI6 took&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:39.200
charge. On actor service in 2007 at a location&nbsp;
near the elephant and castle area in London,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:45.840
he described assassinating an enhanced soldier&nbsp;
who had stolen a suitcased nuclear bomb or pearl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:53.040
and shooting him seven times in the head with his&nbsp;
9mm Smith and Wesson pistol to destroy the cyber&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:59.600
enhancements in the victim's skull. He described&nbsp;
how this was done using a strange small cube of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:05.760
ET or ancient origin which was able to control&nbsp;
the victim. So for more claims and details back&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:13.760
to Michael Prince in the Bases 9 interview 2011&nbsp;
that was on the island of Paneang in Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:21.680
Um there's a NSA facility on the island there. Um&nbsp;
it's a looking glass facility. What's a looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:29.040
glass facility? They use looking glass technology&nbsp;
there. Um piece of hardware mean project looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.560
glass uh remote viewing thing or it's a it's a&nbsp;
piece of hardware looking glass. It looks um I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:41.760
mean I got a photograph of it and is it the set&nbsp;
of glass structures or it's almost like a gold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:50.000
colored metallic cannon with um coils on the back&nbsp;
of it and they they run mercury through the coils&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:59.440
and it opens up portals. So you can um look into&nbsp;
different timelines with it on a video screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:08.880
Is it uh human derived technology or um I don't I&nbsp;
don't think so. No. Um I'd say it's alien derived.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:22.320
I'm not 100% sure right% sure where it comes&nbsp;
from. Um I mean this particular event would um

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:30.720
the I was taken there by my carer&nbsp;
who I was delivered into her care&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:38.640
from Toronto and taken back to London in 81.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:48.080
A mother figure uh like a carer. This was the&nbsp;
the woman um I mentioned her name on the on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:57.680
interview with Richard last night. Um Kate Casbol.&nbsp;
Kate Casbol. Right. Okay. Which is where you get&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:05.280
your personal James Cas. Yeah. Not my biological&nbsp;
mother. Yeah. I mean, we've discussed this and I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:13.920
um there's connections with MI6 with her me. So,&nbsp;
she'd uh she's essentially there to keep you happy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:22.240
and healthy and um in a sort of a normal way.&nbsp;
Yeah, kind of. It was complicated. Um because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:32.880
there was like a foster mother or Yeah. But&nbsp;
then um my her husband um her husband before 81,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:38.160
Peter Kaspar, he was the MI6 agent who was&nbsp;
involved in the drug trafficking operations. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:44.000
mean I've seen some of his file operate uh some of&nbsp;
his file data from he's the guy who got killed. Is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:50.080
that right? He died in Doncaster prison in 2003.&nbsp;
He was serving 6 months for um possession of false&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:57.280
passports and this was in conjunction with his&nbsp;
function in MI6. But they why did they let it go&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:04.080
through or was it? Um was he operating freelance&nbsp;
so to speak? He would sometimes operate freelance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:13.200
It was he'd take drugs um from the shipments to&nbsp;
sell on the side and you know it isn't a drug.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:21.360
So he he extended his brief. Yeah. He didn't like&nbsp;
that. Yeah. And there was also um I I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.880
that's the reason why he died. There was there's&nbsp;
something going on that was dropped off in prison&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:34.640
because people knew he was an agent. Now um I'm&nbsp;
pretty sure he was bumped off. He was um his file&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:40.240
data talks about him being involved in remote&nbsp;
viewing programs for the NSA. A program called&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:47.360
um All Bright and Clear. All Brighton All Brighton&nbsp;
because it was based in Hove and Brighton. All&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:52.800
right. And that there was an NSA remote viewing&nbsp;
program run from Brighton. All Brighton clear it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:59.680
was called. I was given his um identification&nbsp;
number for that program. So he is now MI6. My&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:06.560
um the guy who raised me for a few years&nbsp;
in Barkshire and Reading, Neil Petit. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:10.240
he was never married to Kate Casp. They were&nbsp;
never married, but they were together for a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:18.800
number of name. Neil Petit. He worked just near&nbsp;
Peasmore. Um Hermitage in Newbury. Yeah. Um they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:24.640
he was a director of an aluminium company there.&nbsp;
A big major company. It was a warehouse called&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:32.400
um Himets. It's called Service Metals. Now&nbsp;
he had defense contracts with the MOD. Um he&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:40.160
worked underground at RF Welfford. Um with Can you&nbsp;
describe more about Wilford? Is it just deputy for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:45.600
a weapon story jour? I mean I'm not too sure&nbsp;
about Welfford. I know he worked under there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:52.560
Um he worked underground Bosam down too. And uh&nbsp;
there was there was some sinister aspects of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:52.560 --> 01:05:01.120
company. There was some kind of child pornography&nbsp;
trade video trade going on in in within the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:07.840
company. Is that connected with the ritual child&nbsp;
abuse trauma that I'd say that it's connected with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:13.600
um the the underground facilities. I um when I&nbsp;
remember when I was a kid in Reading in Bshire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:21.280
I found some videos underneath the uh his um&nbsp;
dresser and it showed um I put it on, it showed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:29.680
um a group of men in the Masonic Hall dressed&nbsp;
in Egyptian robes and they were um sexually&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:36.240
abusing little girls. On that particular video,&nbsp;
it was a child pornography thing cuz I mean I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:44.880
being sexually abused by Neil regularly. um his he&nbsp;
was multigenerational incest. His stepfather had&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:56.480
um come out of a Japanese um concentration camp at&nbsp;
the end of World War II. And when um he his name&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:02.640
was Jim Merch. Now when he came back to Barkshire,&nbsp;
he he started to straight away sexually abuse&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:11.200
um Neil and his sister. And there was um there&nbsp;
was satanic ritual elements where he kill the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:17.440
animals in front of them. Yeah. I remember Neil&nbsp;
always cuz Neil was an alcoholic as well because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:25.120
of all this. And um he used to used to get drunk&nbsp;
and sit sit me down. So he always tell me the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:30.160
stories when he was drunk. used to always tell&nbsp;
me about how when Jim took him and his sister&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:35.200
down to garden and killed the rabbits in front&nbsp;
of killed the pet rabbits in front of them and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:43.200
cut their throats and uh he always he he used to&nbsp;
say to me, "Oh, um do you know what a pedophile&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:48.400
is?" And I was young and he said, "If I saw you&nbsp;
in the pub and you told me you were a pedophile,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:54.480
I'd punch you straight in the face." He used to&nbsp;
say things out but then when he used to get drunk&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:00.160
um go into blackout then he'd come in my room&nbsp;
start sexually abusing me and I think it was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:10.560
kind of veilance whereas he was acting out what&nbsp;
was done to him in a really drunken state and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:17.840
uh you know I've been interviewed by C in Cornwall&nbsp;
about this about the sexual abuse with Neil it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:25.840
on record. He lives in Australia in New Zealand&nbsp;
and uh when I saw him a few years back, he says,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:32.560
"Oh, you know, I got this old German guy lives&nbsp;
next door to me and uh I think he's um a Nazi on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:40.000
the run and we we've got really close. He comes&nbsp;
around all the time. He he pretends he's senile.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:47.680
He's not. So this whole And now he pretends he's&nbsp;
senile. Yeah. But he's maybe is he working for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:56.480
Nazis still? Well, it's just no coincidence.&nbsp;
He's got a a an old Nazi next door to him. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:00.960
pretends to be seen now, but he's not. Yeah. Okay.&nbsp;
Just before I say that, I'd like to say I'm not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:08.720
biologically related to either of the families&nbsp;
I just mentioned, the Caspar or the Pettits.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:23.360
Um, I was taken to Malaysia by Kate Casbolt um&nbsp;
the island of Panang and uh straight away remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:29.600
being um walking along a little road in the in&nbsp;
the jungle there. There's a picture of me in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:38.960
jungle at the time holding a snake in front of the&nbsp;
temple. I was put on Project Analog and um I just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:45.280
remember being taken um off the road by an army&nbsp;
jeep and driven down a windy road in a jungle to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:45.280 --> 01:08:52.960
a facility, fence facility, went in and separated&nbsp;
from Kate Casbolt. um taken underground in a lift&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:52.960 --> 01:09:01.360
and there was kind of some command center um there&nbsp;
serious computer operators in their desks and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:08.480
um taken by a American military officer and&nbsp;
shown um video footage. I think it was kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:16.000
some kind of satellite video footage and um I'd&nbsp;
honed him something to remote viewers too and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:25.280
um showed a alien creature in the jungle um a type&nbsp;
of um bipedal wolf almost like a small Bigfoot but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:32.240
wearing a like a almost a brown robe with with a&nbsp;
belt around it with some kind of hardware around&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:40.640
the belt and um it was a still camera shot or&nbsp;
it I personally think it was um taken through&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:46.320
the eyes of a remote viewer and it connect they&nbsp;
were connected to satellite. I think it was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:52.400
camera shot through. So you can directly you can&nbsp;
directly photograph and record what people see&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:58.480
either through through their by telepathically&nbsp;
ruing in or by an implant or by an implant. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:04.720
all physical. And I think that this this was&nbsp;
what the remote viewer saw just before he died&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:08.880
because this creature, as far as I know, killed&nbsp;
that remote viewer and that was the last thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.840
he saw. How did they kill a remote viewer? Uh, I&nbsp;
think he shot him with some kind of particle beam&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:19.840
weapon cuz I saw these creatures operate those.&nbsp;
So, I mean, the remote viewer is physically not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:31.280
where the being was. Now he's physically tracking&nbsp;
the um being through the jungle and he's um

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:39.440
I think he's seen him from a distance but when I&nbsp;
say remote viewing he's like a camera he's zoomed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:45.600
into him from a long using his physical vision&nbsp;
but using his remote viewing abilities to zoom&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:54.880
in right and uh so when the other being shot him&nbsp;
Yeah. Does he shoot the his presence as a remote&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:00.160
viewer? Does he see like an orb or something?&nbsp;
How does he see? No, he's physically there. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:05.120
soldier's physically in the jungle tracking this&nbsp;
creature through the jungle, but the creature's at&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:12.560
a distance far away. So, the soldier has zoomed in&nbsp;
with his vision, which is a type of remote view,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:18.560
but it's more physical because it's connected to&nbsp;
satellite. But then, how is he shot if he's if&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:23.600
he's so far away? because the creature on the&nbsp;
still shot that I was showing on the screen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:31.120
the creature turned around like that and&nbsp;
was looked. So, from my understanding,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:38.560
the creature seeing him and then like a sniper&nbsp;
shot him from long range these particle beam&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:47.200
um devices that they use. So I was shown that&nbsp;
and I was um the the creature growled at the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:51.840
same time and that was picked up the sound and&nbsp;
uh below the still shot there was a sound wave&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:58.000
of the growl and the metrophosis used the word&nbsp;
gruff. I'm not exactly sure what that meant. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:08.720
gruff uh gruff just gruff. Gr u ff gruff. And um&nbsp;
they played the soundwave to me under the screen&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.400
which was the growl and they played it to me once&nbsp;
and then they said focus on it and they played&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:20.160
it to me again and played it about three or four&nbsp;
times and each time was picking up the um energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:28.960
signature of the creature. What do you mean by&nbsp;
the energy signature of the creature? Um, I was

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:35.680
a lot of it was to do with the scent. It's picking&nbsp;
up its scent, but on by hearing it, I could smell&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.960
it. So that would help you track it. Yeah. And&nbsp;
this where it comes into the condition and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:49.280
went through with the animals back in Canada.&nbsp;
So then bring us to where the event happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:55.840
So we were taken I was taken out again above&nbsp;
ground put in a uh there was a two jeep convoy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:04.720
soldiers and it was a woman in the front and&nbsp;
we were driven through the jungle um to it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:10.240
like a path in the jungle basically and we got out&nbsp;
and we tked through the jungle for hours. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:18.080
I was only a little kid. And um after a couple&nbsp;
hours, we stopped for a rest in this clearing in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:23.040
the jungle. It's like almost like a little the&nbsp;
pathway was turned into almost a crossroads,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:29.920
like one path come this way, one path there, like&nbsp;
a crossroads. And um we'd just stop to have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:37.200
drink and have a rest. And I'd pick something up&nbsp;
in the trees. And um what do you mean by picked&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:47.360
it up? don't smell it. But it's more than just&nbsp;
smell. It's like you can you can see smells.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:56.240
Um I picked something up in the trees and um&nbsp;
I mean I looked up and I saw it in the tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:00.400
It it we were supposed to be tracking it, but it&nbsp;
had been following us. It already knew you were&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:05.680
coming. Yeah. And it was there. It was in the&nbsp;
tree. And I I shouted up to one of the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:13.840
say, "It's up there." And um and this is where the&nbsp;
um the abilities of these soldiers comes in. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:19.280
was this was the first time I saw the abilities&nbsp;
of them. And this was later I would have the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:26.480
abilities. Um the moment I I saw it and it knew&nbsp;
that I'd seen it, it kind of went up like that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:38.960
and it um shot some beam out towards me. Um it was&nbsp;
almost like um it it made the air like swish like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:47.920
a rotation like that. I just I just felt the swish&nbsp;
like this rotation sort of coming towards me but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:55.680
it was like metallic but it glowed the air. No,&nbsp;
the thing that it shot particle beam or whatever&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:01.360
it was, you could feel it was so powerful you&nbsp;
could feel the air moving to come towards you and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:07.040
it was swiveing as it came through. But it was so&nbsp;
fast but my senses picked it up and just before it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:14.560
hit me, one of the soldiers somehow projected some&nbsp;
force field around my body and um so this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:21.040
relatively slow No, it's very fast. This happened&nbsp;
in a split second. I'm not sure. It's almost like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:27.840
time slows down and it all happened in a split&nbsp;
second, but the soldier was able to project the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:33.600
force field around my body before it hit me. So&nbsp;
he'd already projected this to you as soon as&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:40.320
he said where it was. As soon as I clocked him,&nbsp;
bang, he shot he fired in the tree. So this is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:46.960
protection mechanism. Um the soldier projected a&nbsp;
force around like an egg. It's almost like water&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:55.840
and then boom. It didn't it didn't hurt me at all.&nbsp;
him and um and then I it all happened so fast and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:02.320
then I seen another soldier. He he he's up in the&nbsp;
standing here and he's up in the tree here on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:08.640
left hand side. Seen another soldier like in a&nbsp;
split second he's there like a cat. He's run to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:15.600
the tree and he's run he's scaled up the tree.&nbsp;
He's run up the tree like a cat. Yeah. Um like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:24.960
an animal. you were actually run up this big high&nbsp;
tree like a palm tree or some kind of leafy tree&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:33.520
or was with with lots and branches or it had quite&nbsp;
a thick um trunk enough. It was bigger than his&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:39.920
body. Yeah. Maybe one and a half twice the size of&nbsp;
his body and he just he's he's standing there. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.200
wasn't a soldier that projected the force field.&nbsp;
there was a different one standing behind him and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:47.680
he's there in a split second like a cat is at the&nbsp;
base of the tree and like I say then he's running&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:54.240
up the tree scaling up the tree like a cat and he&nbsp;
gets to the top of the tree and he's like perched&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:54.240 --> 01:17:00.400
it on top of the tree in the branch. He's perched&nbsp;
like like a bird or something like squatted on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:09.360
branch like looking up and his back is um like&nbsp;
expanded outwards. Um he's almost like pulled&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:19.120
energy up like uh from his from his center and&nbsp;
he's like boom and his back boom popped out popped&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:26.800
out. His back the muscles in his back have popped&nbsp;
out. Yeah. It's like bulging out his um top like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:34.960
um and he's perched in the tree and this thing&nbsp;
has um this thing has either jumped um from this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:42.720
tree to the next tree or he's he's some sort of&nbsp;
teleportation teleportated to the next tree to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:49.120
next branch. He's gone woof just Yeah. But it's&nbsp;
like he launched himself but then you don't see&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:56.000
him flying through the air. He sort of launched&nbsp;
himself off the bush and then the reappear.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:02.960
Um he does the same thing. He chases him into&nbsp;
the next tree and he like sort of launches&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:09.040
himself off the branch. But again, he sort of&nbsp;
teleportation. He just appears in the next tree&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.360
and then the the creatures like boom to the&nbsp;
next tree. They're chasing each other through&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:19.840
the trees. The the creature and this soldier.&nbsp;
I mean it's amazing to watch. And after a while&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:28.080
they obviously disappeared. You can't see them&nbsp;
anymore. And um the one of the operators had a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:36.560
a type of laptop computer and um he he went this&nbsp;
was like really he got it quickly next to me and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:42.800
he wanted me to tune in. And I shut my eyes&nbsp;
and I could see a screen in my mind's eye and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:51.760
um I could see the um the creature. There's a&nbsp;
red dot on the screen moving forward. Um so is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:58.080
he following the creature or is he following his&nbsp;
compatriate following the creature? He the guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:04.000
in the tree is chasing the creature through the&nbsp;
tree. The red dot the actual creature. The red dot&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:11.040
is the creature. This is some kind of satellite&nbsp;
remote viewing thing link up. And the the um what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:20.160
the the the red dot in my mind's eye is like a map&nbsp;
is the creature moving in a certain direction. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:27.040
um the the the soldier following him is a green&nbsp;
dot following him in the same direction. and uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:34.560
on the screen on the laptop with the soldier next&nbsp;
to me. What I'm seeing um the picture the map is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:40.160
on the the screen. So he's trekking it and he's&nbsp;
reporting back to the base. Were there more red&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.280
dots? Yeah. Well, this is it. The other soldiers&nbsp;
that were with us started running after them on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.680
the ground with their guns. They obviously&nbsp;
they didn't have the ability to do all this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:55.920
tree climbing thing. They run through and I&nbsp;
saw them as a series of green dots as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:03.280
um be following behind the first soldier, not&nbsp;
as fast. In other words, he had backup. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:16.000
they were going through and um and then I saw&nbsp;
another dot moving in a bigger one. Um I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.960
this was a purple dot, a bigger one. And I&nbsp;
said to the operating, I said, "He's calling&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:28.400
in his ship." So he's calling in his ship. And&nbsp;
um in other words, one of ours, one of our No,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:39.280
he the creature was calling in the ship to&nbsp;
escape cuz he was being pursued. And um the

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:45.920
the operator got on the radio and um&nbsp;
said um uh something about air support,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:53.600
calling in air support. Few must have only&nbsp;
been maybe 30 seconds or a minute later.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:53.600 --> 01:21:01.360
um two huge TR3 type of um aircraft, black&nbsp;
triangles, come really low over the trees. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:08.080
whole ground was like rumbling. Come really&nbsp;
low over the trees. Um I saw there I could&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:14.960
physically see them over the trees. They followed&nbsp;
the direction of the the firefight and then after&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:23.200
they disappeared from view and um and then I heard&nbsp;
um some kind of missiles being fired. I heard shot&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:32.560
uh weapons fired. Weapons being fired, but air air&nbsp;
weapons. And um I and the ground was rumbling when&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:41.280
these missiles were being fired. And um and then&nbsp;
that was it. It disappeared. And then the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:47.120
eventually came back. They said, "He's got away.&nbsp;
The creature got away. He got to his He got to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:52.880
his got to his ship and got away." And that caused&nbsp;
us major problems. What's the reason why? Because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:52.880 --> 01:21:59.120
this creature was involved in our lives when we&nbsp;
were adults. It wasn't isn't coincidence. We were&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:03.360
connected to this creature. This creature turned&nbsp;
up at Peasmore. This creature turned up at other&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:11.120
bases. And um is that the kind of creature that&nbsp;
Barry King described? This was a wolf. This was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:20.240
a bipedal wolf like a small Bigfoot. um where&nbsp;
uh with a cut type of brown robe. You're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:25.680
talking about something very tall. Yeah, tall&nbsp;
by like a man, but like a wolf, like a big foot&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:34.400
um 6T, something like that. And he very similar&nbsp;
to the um flying humanoids. The footage you see&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:43.280
in South America, it was kind of similar to&nbsp;
that, you know. Um I think they're creatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:51.440
I I've heard the name um creatures from the Kanes&nbsp;
Empire being banded around. Um I think they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:57.280
extraterrestrials from Sirius. I've never heard&nbsp;
of them before. I've nobody's ever talked about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:05.200
them before. They're on YouTube. But well, nobody&nbsp;
said there are um sort of bipedal wolf people from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:12.000
Syria, Kanas Empire, but it's just when I saw&nbsp;
the footage on YouTube, the flying humanoids,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:19.200
um they were it was similar to what&nbsp;
I saw in the jungle in Panang. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:26.320
uh that was a an unsuccessful mission there.&nbsp;
Yeah. But that's a that how long was that in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:34.320
in in the planning of what happened that um that&nbsp;
this creature was detected? Um he apparently the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:39.440
creature had come into the area. There was&nbsp;
some military conflict going on in Malaysia&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:46.080
at the time the SAS the SAS. Is that because that&nbsp;
those creatures are used to train uh more of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:46.080 --> 01:24:01.120
um enhanced superchild type children by&nbsp;
the SS? Um this creature had come in to um

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:06.160
it was somehow learning about human emotions.&nbsp;
It was learn it was learning from the conflict&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:10.640
of the soldiers killing each other in the area.&nbsp;
It was something to do there was some military&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:17.920
conflict in the SAS on the border of Malaysia&nbsp;
and Thailand all the time. And uh the this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:22.560
a conflict that we could look up. Yeah, it was&nbsp;
an official conflict, an official war. And the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:29.200
creature had come in, it was it was learning about&nbsp;
the human emotions. It was studying the conflict,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:34.960
and it was almost feeding when the soldiers&nbsp;
were killing each other in the jungle. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:41.760
was almost feeding off the energy almost in&nbsp;
a sexual way, feeding off the death and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:48.880
uh fear and the hate. So, it's very nasty. So&nbsp;
then that would be useful for reprogramming&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:53.520
or programming more super soldiers or more more&nbsp;
enhanced soldiers. Well, the creature turned up&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:59.200
at peace more and was used in the programming.&nbsp;
So it turned up at peace more before or after.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:05.200
This was years later. Yeah. Oh, years later. This&nbsp;
years later. Yeah. If it came back to the planet,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:09.120
I mean it might have never have left the&nbsp;
planet. So why were we trying to pursue&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:13.280
it to kill it? Or were we going to kill? Were&nbsp;
you trying to kill it? Um I think they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:17.840
trying to kill it. But then I would have&nbsp;
then come back in and say hello because it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:26.560
obviously escaped and then it had um it it had&nbsp;
its um human collaborators which were probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:39.600
these factions that we've talked about that&nbsp;
have got human race best interest at heart.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:46.208
[Music]

01:25:46.208 --> 01:25:53.760
[Music]&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:58.640
In part three, Michael Prince claimed the Looking&nbsp;
Glass project was a piece of hardware involving&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:04.080
Mercury. It allowed operators to open portals&nbsp;
into different timelines. Could this be related&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:10.000
to the Nancy Bell project from World War II?&nbsp;
He describes his life as James Casbold with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.080
his carer Kate Casbolt. This gave a background&nbsp;
to life as James and his stepfather who died&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:22.800
in prison in 2003. The MI6 connection is further&nbsp;
enhanced. A complex, sickening family arrangement&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:29.360
involving child abuse, satanic rituals is familiar&nbsp;
territory. In this dark tale of mind control, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:36.320
Nazi SS in a modern age, and an alien human war.&nbsp;
While a young child in 1982, his service on an&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:42.560
active mission in Panang, Malaysia is described.&nbsp;
The pursuit of a humanoid bipeal wolf type alien&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:49.280
is described. [Music] In this final section,&nbsp;
Prince's missions in Brazil and an active mission&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:55.280
involving Dave Maro, who we saw in Beta 7, and&nbsp;
a shootown of a strange octoform alien creatures&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:02.080
craft in St. Ives and Cornwall in March 2011.&nbsp;
Prince declares, "World War II is in progress&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:06.960
and we're going to win it." The viewer must study&nbsp;
Prince's voice and mannerisms to see just how much&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:13.520
of this is actually true or some kind of wild&nbsp;
fiction with access to incredible detail. With&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:19.680
more to follow from Caswell's colleague, the Grid&nbsp;
Keeper, I'm Barry King. We now bring you Michael&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:25.280
Prince in part four. Any further points you want&nbsp;
to get across this time? Um, I'd just like to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:34.720
mention two points quickly. Um after that we I was&nbsp;
transferred to um a facility in South America uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:40.960
Manus near Brazil. This was actually a facility&nbsp;
in the Andes mountains big underground city and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:51.040
that was another NSA facility code named Plume and&nbsp;
um we we were George Bush Senior was there again.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:58.960
Was that when he was president? Um this was or&nbsp;
as vice president. This was 83 84 mid80s working&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:07.520
um and yeah manas Brazil facility code name&nbsp;
plume and uh in the Andes mountains and it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:12.800
it was that was a Nazi training facility that we&nbsp;
were trained in a huge hall there and there were&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:19.120
groups of children divided into 1520 there hugest&nbsp;
hall some of them would be um doing climbing wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:26.320
climbing some of them be shooting martial arts and&nbsp;
it um the hall had two Nazi bands near the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:36.720
one on each side, swastikas and um Dr. Green&nbsp;
was there because um project Ibis was started&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:44.720
in 1972 at Tavistock Institute and um doc Dr.&nbsp;
Green was one of the people that started it and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:52.160
Joseph Mangallay from Awitz. He was at Bloom.&nbsp;
Joseph Mangallay, he programmed us. Um George&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:57.600
Brcina programmed us. We did operations there.&nbsp;
George Brcina actually gave us medals there for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:03.200
that facility. We all lined up. Is that where the&nbsp;
Nazis I mean Brazil or that part of South America&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:12.720
is be known for where the Nazis went after World&nbsp;
War II? This is Manus. Manas. Yeah. And um yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:23.440
the second point is um the we mentioned there's&nbsp;
a cloning aspect of this. Um we a couple of years&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:35.680
back um 2008 it was um close friend of mine um&nbsp;
driving along the motorway in Worththing and C&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:41.440
pulls up behind him starts flashing his lights and&nbsp;
uh there two guys there one of the guys is going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:48.240
like that to pull over. So my friend pulls over,&nbsp;
the car pulls up. Um, guy gets out in his suit,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:48.240 --> 01:29:55.360
opens the door and says his name. He says, "Could&nbsp;
you come with us, please?" Uh, and uh, I'd like&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:55.360 --> 01:30:03.200
you to follow my colleague along the road. And um,&nbsp;
my friend became very compliant. This guy gets the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:08.320
guy in the suit gets in the passenger seat, cars,&nbsp;
says, "Can you follow my colleague drive along the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:18.640
motorway? Follow it up. Drive into a car park. up&nbsp;
there's an SUV in the car park and um they door&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:25.120
opens. First person he sees sitting in the SUV&nbsp;
is me. Um second person he sees is another person&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:31.600
that's here pro um another close friend of ours.&nbsp;
Third person he sees is a perfect replica clone&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:37.120
of himself sitting in the SUV. Can you mention&nbsp;
the other person that's here at Pro? I won't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:43.760
mention his name on camera. We can talk about it&nbsp;
afterwards. Okay. Um he it's one of those SUVs&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:48.160
um like a little conference room and back table&nbsp;
like five seven chairs around it. There's two&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:58.560
other young guys that we he'd never seen before&nbsp;
and um you get in and say shut the door. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:02.720
the guy the other guy waits outside and they all&nbsp;
sit down. They all just sit there staring at each&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:07.440
other. He's got a clone of himself. He's fully&nbsp;
conscious. Got a clone of himself sitting there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:14.320
looking back at him. Um the the the operative in&nbsp;
the suit says, "Okay." Says his name, "What have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:23.440
you got to tell us?" He turns around and says,&nbsp;
"I don't know what you're talking about." And uh

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:32.720
so I'm sitting there at the time, my clone is&nbsp;
in St. I with my with the Casbol family. There's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:42.720
pictures of him there. And um so again, you&nbsp;
know, sitting there and he says there's silence.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:46.960
Everyone's just sitting there staring at each&nbsp;
other. Really bizarre situation. Again, the guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:50.240
goes, "Okay, what have you got to tell us?" And&nbsp;
again, he says, "I don't know what you're talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:55.360
about." And then the guy say, "Okay, I think this&nbsp;
meeting's over." Then when he says that, the guy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:55.360 --> 01:32:01.200
um just open the guy outside just opens the door&nbsp;
like they're communicating telepathically or get&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:08.720
out. They just drive off, just leave me standing&nbsp;
there in the car park. And um there's a picture&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:14.240
of one of my clones, a photograph of one of my&nbsp;
clones in Iraq working for Blackwater. And they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:20.400
uh the intelligence community put it on the front&nbsp;
cover of Ice Spy magazine. And we've got a copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:26.240
They can see the picture on the internet. What&nbsp;
edition of Ice Spy? 40 42 or 47. I can I've got&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:33.760
the picture. I can send you a link. And um I mean&nbsp;
it's a perfect clone, but there's no tattoos. Does&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:40.720
he know that it's Did he Is he aware it's a copy&nbsp;
of you? Is is the what the clone? Yeah. I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:47.440
know what he's aware of. It's not Can we talk&nbsp;
to him? I mean, there's only one me. Yeah. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:47.440 --> 01:32:52.240
he Yeah, but that's, you know, that's that's&nbsp;
there on the front cover. There's also some&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:52.240 --> 01:33:05.840
um crash retrieval video footage taken in Chin.&nbsp;
Um there's me at the crash retrieval site just um

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:13.120
there's another person here is here at probe and&nbsp;
that's two people here. Yeah. No, there's me and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:18.160
another person here at probe now. They're at the&nbsp;
site of the crash retrieval footage. There's a a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:23.920
shot down alien ship on the video footage.&nbsp;
There's a group of reptilians on the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:34.160
footage. that there's a body a small alien body&nbsp;
as um not tape a body or it's it's filmed by um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:39.680
an associate of ours is connected to the SAS it&nbsp;
it's filmed at Goodwood Hill in Chichester near&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:46.000
Goodwood airfield at night. Um he's filmed it from&nbsp;
about a mile away. It's a series of hills. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:53.040
very indistinctive material. But it's not sort of&nbsp;
there at the alien or what you can see if if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:58.800
examine it closely and look at it, you can see&nbsp;
that there's a group of beings that if you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:06.240
compare the other guy who's probably very tall, 6'&nbsp;
3. Yeah. That these group of aliens walk past him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:12.320
There's a tower above him. They must be 8t tall&nbsp;
on it. And they're carrying the body away. They're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:18.560
all they're all walking. Are they veil? They're&nbsp;
reptilians. Yeah, these creatures with horns. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:24.400
you can make out the horns if you look closely&nbsp;
if you blow Are they stuff horns or um not huge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:29.680
just that here. Short stubs. Yeah, short stubs.&nbsp;
And you you can make it out on the video footage&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:34.560
if you blow it up and keep stopping it. Look&nbsp;
closely. You can see the horns on the head. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:40.400
um there's they they all walk in perfect&nbsp;
sync together like robots. Like they all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.760
are collective. You can see that. You can see&nbsp;
they're not walking human. on it. They walk,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:49.280
they carry the body back to their ship. You&nbsp;
can see their ship on the left hand side.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:55.760
You can see an object would have been. Yeah.&nbsp;
Come in. And then there's um the fire engine&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:55.760 --> 01:35:00.560
to the right and the vehicles. That's where the&nbsp;
SAS were. That's where I was on the right hand&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:06.720
side. My friend who's a pro and another two&nbsp;
of our associates there stood in front of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:13.520
um ship. Now the when the reptilians walk past&nbsp;
my friend, you can see them if you slow it down&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:18.480
again. Look at a few times blow up. You can&nbsp;
see he freaks out a lot when they walk past&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:26.640
him. That was a shock because they're so close.&nbsp;
Scary things and he's they got close. You see&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:32.880
him from a distance you have, you know, bit&nbsp;
of denial there up close. You can see him,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:42.240
you know. Look at that. And um they're passing&nbsp;
some sort of hardware. uh the those operatives,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:48.000
those human operatives near the craft have&nbsp;
passed hardware back to the reptilians that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.400
they just been loaned and it's again these little&nbsp;
these small cube type devices and these cube type&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:54.400 --> 01:36:02.240
devices they do they have many um they do many&nbsp;
things and they operate by thought. Yeah, they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:08.160
connect to brain waves. They on this particular&nbsp;
night there was my friend doesn't remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:11.760
everything about the operation. I don't remember&nbsp;
everything about it, but there was something to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:20.320
with we brought this craft down with these cubes&nbsp;
against some kind of particle beam weapons. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:28.000
I'll just end it as you can you can see the&nbsp;
craft has been shot down behind my friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:35.840
Have you ever been involved with off mission off&nbsp;
off planet functions? Yes. And uh when we talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:42.080
about off planet was extraterrestrial physically&nbsp;
in this universe or is it been through a portal of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:48.320
some kind like often into a different dimension?&nbsp;
This was um Sirius a planet on Sirius and this was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:55.680
um how what was involved there? Um this was&nbsp;
the a transport from the facility in London.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:55.680 --> 01:37:05.200
um mid '90s um transported on the underground tube&nbsp;
system through a Stargate from London to a planet&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:11.840
on Sirius. Is there a particular train station&nbsp;
that is a Stargate? Um there's these Stargates&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:19.920
in London. London uh CL you go that's so that's&nbsp;
basically near Westminster. Yeah. You park there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:25.840
a hotel on Park Lane and there's an underground&nbsp;
car park there. You can drive into that if you got&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:30.320
the clearance. Go down the lift. Then you can get&nbsp;
into the lower sections. If you got the clearance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:35.600
get on the train through the Stargate to this&nbsp;
planet and see it. It's like a water well with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:40.720
a big land mass in the middle. There's a facility&nbsp;
on the ocean bed which is a perfect replica of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:47.120
Pentagon. Why does have to be perfect replicent?&nbsp;
Or the replica or the Pentagon is a perfect&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:53.040
replica of this facility. That's more correct.&nbsp;
Yes. But I think this facility in Syria has been&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:56.640
there thousands of years and they basically So&nbsp;
that means they must have known about this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:01.760
seen it obviously to build it there. Well,&nbsp;
they've been there the uh the people I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:05.920
the people that built the Pentagon have been to&nbsp;
this place and it's divi it's interesting because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:11.440
it's I think it's divided into like seven. It's&nbsp;
a Pentagon within a Pentagon within the Pentagon.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:17.840
Each um section facility houses a different alien&nbsp;
race and it's actually an artificial intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:25.120
facility. It's the facility is an intelligent is&nbsp;
an artificial intelligence. It's actually an AI&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:31.440
based computer system controls the facility&nbsp;
and controls each alien race in each section&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:41.280
of the facility. And AI is doing experiments&nbsp;
to see which of the races um in the universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:46.960
I think there's seven root races. The artificial&nbsp;
intelligence is is doing experiments to see which&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:54.000
one is the has the highest survival dynamics,&nbsp;
which race is basically the most powerful. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:01.680
uh so this artificial intelligence uh who was&nbsp;
it made by? I think it's really old. But you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:06.000
mentioned in some of your your emails about an&nbsp;
artificial intelligence system which has taken&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:11.680
over the planet and we are trying to fight against&nbsp;
that. Is that is that something? did take over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:17.920
planet, but there was some operations last year in&nbsp;
France in the north of France and it was they it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:22.720
was shut down on how does it manifest itself?&nbsp;
I've got a theory that the electricity supply&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:26.720
system and the computer supply system and the&nbsp;
broadcast system are being used by an artificial&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:34.960
intelligence to take control of us. That's that's&nbsp;
what I summarizes what's going on. Is that related&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:42.000
to that? This is a huge subject. It's a huge&nbsp;
scientific subject and I know a fair amount of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:52.880
but um it's all included in um the project IBIS&nbsp;
data that's being released on um Camelot by Kerry&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:52.880 --> 01:40:01.920
Cassidy. Right. So all people need to do is type&nbsp;
in James Casbot Ibis and um that will come up.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.960
Is that being released by you personally or is&nbsp;
it being released under your name when you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:11.920
under that? That is my data that's being released&nbsp;
by Kerry in that paper in those papers and that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:20.560
data on Camelot. Um I'm talking about the physical&nbsp;
um computer system how it operates. Um are they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:30.000
essentially vehicles being used by the agencies&nbsp;
to disinform or inform or both? Um probably say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:40.240
it's a m I mean mixture. Yeah, mixture. It's&nbsp;
uh there's some good information coming out.

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:48.480
What things should we look for? We Okay,&nbsp;
it's um alien human war, World War II,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:53.360
alien human war. And that is going to be&nbsp;
manifest as sort of 80s running down the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:58.320
street shooting people or flying saucers landing&nbsp;
on Blackpool Tower. It's happening all the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:04.160
Miles. There's um I told you know I sent you&nbsp;
the briefing report about what happened in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:09.680
St. Ives a couple of weeks back which is in&nbsp;
broad daylight. A ship was shot down. There&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:18.080
was a jets over the over my daughter's school&nbsp;
military jet. Next thing this was in 3:15 in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:24.800
the afternoon. The ship was shot down. It came&nbsp;
down in the back garden on Park Avenue. police&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:30.480
fire brigade and there some kind of octapform.&nbsp;
They uh they sealed the roads off that I got sent&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:39.200
up there. They got sent in and um an octop would&nbsp;
be what I would describe as as an octopus. This&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:48.800
was like a This was a physical large octopus.&nbsp;
There's nothing about it. This is a kind of

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:53.760
This was like a This was a physical large&nbsp;
octopus. Yeah, there's nothing lyricic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:56.800
about this. This is the kind of thing&nbsp;
that I've seen kind of break into the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:56.800 --> 01:42:02.960
back of Sky Television. It was um it had&nbsp;
come down. It had crashed into the shed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:08.400
set the shed on fire on Park Avenue. Was this&nbsp;
the craft or the glacier itself? No, the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.280
the military jets had shot the craft down. It come&nbsp;
down, hit the shed in the back garden of a house&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:13.280 --> 01:42:21.920
on Park Avenue. What size of things are we talking&nbsp;
about here? Well, the the ship. The ship. Yeah.

01:42:22.640 --> 01:42:30.080
20 not a big 20 30 ft. So this opt form exists&nbsp;
really in an old craft in a well the optoform&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:40.480
is that high that wide the tentacles maybe you&nbsp;
know 6 ft um it basically it's the craft had&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:49.040
set the shed on fire the thing had come out the um&nbsp;
craft scuttled along the garden that's a good word&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:57.440
um and that um climbed up the side of the building&nbsp;
and broke the window and was hiding in the attic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:05.680
of this house, you know, and this is and there's&nbsp;
there's paper reports in the papers about the fire&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:10.480
breaking out and there was just another fire.&nbsp;
A car had been set on fire a couple of hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:20.560
before by by the military shooting alien ships&nbsp;
down because it's World War II human alien war&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:20.560 --> 01:43:26.160
and people say people say it's disinformation.&nbsp;
Uh they want to create an alien threat. They're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:33.520
sending PLFS in. These are all PLFS and it's all a&nbsp;
big setup to um stage World War II stage in alien&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:40.720
invasion. It it is not um there is groups working&nbsp;
with there's human groups working with aliens to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:40.720 --> 01:43:47.840
stage an alien invasion, but there's a real alien&nbsp;
invasion at the same time. So there's a stage one&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:53.760
and a real one at the same time. just in the way&nbsp;
seven the 77 bowlings you had a you had a thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.880
stage there and you the other the real yeah the&nbsp;
real thing so um this is why this information is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:06.080
coming out this is going to increase this is you&nbsp;
know you anytime you see a fire in the street now&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:16.400
with police sealing the roads off am um ambulances&nbsp;
fire engines and you're not allowed near it be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:23.440
suspicious investigate it find out what went on.&nbsp;
So, we're losing the ability to keep the cover up,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:31.280
the lid on the cover up. So, at what point do we&nbsp;
have a a holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] situation? Are we getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.680
near to that point? Well, we're kind of in it&nbsp;
now, but I don't think it's anything. We're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:40.800
going to win. This is um You don't think we're&nbsp;
going to win? No. What I mean is we are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:48.080
to win. when the when AI did this um these&nbsp;
series of scientific tests to work out what&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:53.520
race had the highest survival dynamics in this&nbsp;
underwater facility. It was determined that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:53.520 --> 01:45:01.680
human race have the highest survival dynamics. Now&nbsp;
there's um there's philosophies that say the human&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:07.760
form is the original form in the universe.&nbsp;
It's the most perfect form in the universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:17.680
So, and this is why so we got, you know,&nbsp;
we're going to win. It's going to be about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:23.120
hering people into safety zones and we're&nbsp;
going to have to take care of it. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:30.000
the average man on the street isn't not going to&nbsp;
be able to do much. There'll be people already in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:35.680
the population who'll be activated to clear, move&nbsp;
people along, to get people out of the way. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:43.760
at the same time dealing with the threat. So, it's&nbsp;
being handled on every level. So, it's dangerous,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:50.240
but situations under control. You got a bit of a&nbsp;
scar there. I just thought is this an example of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:57.280
uh of what was involved with your technology or&nbsp;
um No, they Yeah, this is connected to it. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:06.960
this is connected to Royal Ber Hospital and&nbsp;
there was um this Osiris program body parts. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:14.160
cuz sometimes if you get you get your body damaged&nbsp;
instead of just surgery putting you back together,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:20.400
they might just cut the body part off and&nbsp;
attach a new one. Some people know who my&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:31.520
fiance is. We're getting married soon. um her&nbsp;
story, her testimony, what she's been through

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:38.480
will change the world in many ways. Is she able&nbsp;
to discuss her at any time? Able to discuss it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:46.560
at the moment. There's too many implications&nbsp;
with her. you know, with we're having constant&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:54.320
harassment in many ways and we're having to take&nbsp;
the the fight to the people um who are harassing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:54.320 --> 01:47:03.360
us. We've got constant um protection, bodyguards,&nbsp;
you know, we met when we met in France last year,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:09.600
she wasn't allowed into the country. She was&nbsp;
detained in in Heathrow when she tried to visit&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:14.960
me from America, some very nasty things happened.&nbsp;
very nasty things. You I think you know about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:24.400
that. Yeah. And um we had to meet in France. We&nbsp;
had a bodyguard there from a private security firm&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:32.800
um chauffeur. He he drove us from France to um&nbsp;
on the ferry. We came through Plymouth Border&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:41.840
Patrol. We were pulled in again at Puma Border&nbsp;
Patrol and uh the two MI5 officers turned up&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:47.840
um posing as police officers and said&nbsp;
they questioning me under um the some&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:54.400
anti-terrorism act. They gave me the leaflet um&nbsp;
2006 anti-terrorism act said if I didn't answer&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:54.400 --> 01:48:00.960
that question they were going to arrest me. Um,&nbsp;
the woman who taught questioned me look very much&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:11.600
like Stella Remington ex head of MI5. Yeah.&nbsp;
And when we came back from America recently,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:19.520
um, Director Baro was at the airport. Yeah.&nbsp;
Director Bar Alfred Ber from MI6 was there&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:23.760
to make sure you got through. Okay. Uh, he&nbsp;
was there. We got through. Okay. But he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:36.560
there just at the end just showing his face.&nbsp;
just like the cavalry is there. Yeah. Yeah.

01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:45.440
So, what about um Nazis? Oh, god. Straight to&nbsp;
the point. Um I'm interested in the fact that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:53.920
many many moons ago um in my more young and&nbsp;
enthusiastic days I um supposedly allegedly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:59.120
channeled and that's the only way I can put it&nbsp;
a whole load of information which seems to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:07.120
coming true um or at least certainly becoming more&nbsp;
mainstream. Um, and I always at the time believed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:13.840
that a lot of what people were experiencing&nbsp;
um, in terms of alien abduction was to do more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:20.720
with secret research pro projects that probably&nbsp;
originated back in the Third Reich. Um, what kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:26.160
of secret research program? Well, I mean, I think&nbsp;
everything from propulsion systems involving anti&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:32.400
anti-gravity to to genetic, you know, research.&nbsp;
Um and the um you know obviously they're trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:41.040
to create an Uber man um an Uber race um genetic&nbsp;
knowledge that potentially could cause unrest&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:46.720
between racial groups obviously which has happened&nbsp;
in the past um and which we don't want to happen&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:53.200
again. That's deeper though. Deeper. What are&nbsp;
those messages about the alternative technology,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:58.240
alternative propulsion systems and genetic uh&nbsp;
research? You know, it probably wasn't clear in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:03.440
the first video, but I was a UFO researcher.&nbsp;
I researched with London UFO studies. Uh I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:09.760
researched when I when I moved out of London with&nbsp;
another local UFO group. Um so I came at it from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:15.760
that from things that had happened to me obviously&nbsp;
got me into UFO research, but once I got into it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:20.640
and started looking at cases and you know, just&nbsp;
take the case of Betty and Barney Hill, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:25.760
the whole Nazi link there. Um and they were a&nbsp;
mixed race family as well, which is interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:31.840
Um, so I do think that that, you know, a an&nbsp;
agenda, whether that agenda is an alien one&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:38.800
or a human one is still happening that potentially&nbsp;
started or at least revealed itself in in the in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:38.800 --> 01:50:43.200
the Third Reich and in in some of the the stuff&nbsp;
that was going on back in the Third Reich. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:49.360
whether or not, as some people allege, that links&nbsp;
back to different alien groups seeding different&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:55.200
bloodlines on Earth is anyone's guess. as some&nbsp;
people alleged the Nazis believed they were,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:01.120
you know, this alleged race that lived in, you&nbsp;
know, um, Agata and Shambala. Um, honestly don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:05.280
know. I mean, I've only just lit out a long&nbsp;
time. And it's only recently that things have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:10.080
happened in my life. What's an connection with&nbsp;
with Cornwall? Why did they want here? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:14.320
I mean, that's an interesting one. I don't know&nbsp;
why. I mean, I can't I can only theorize. Just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:20.720
interviewed um Michael. Yeah. Prince. Yeah. And&nbsp;
he's talking about the Nazi connection a lot in in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:24.240
Yes, that's right. And that's one of the reasons&nbsp;
why I've decided to speak out because you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:24.240 --> 01:51:31.120
that he you know I I've only met him once and and&nbsp;
he was obviously very much triggered by by Barry&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:36.800
King's information. Um and you know obviously&nbsp;
that made him remember and recall or connected&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:41.600
with him on some level and now he is speaking&nbsp;
about the Nazi link. It has made me think well&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:49.120
he's in Cornwall more correctly the SS link. The&nbsp;
SS. Yeah. Yeah. The SS the thing about the SS it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:55.680
it's interesting with the SS. I mean the SS on&nbsp;
one level was you know a police this is the whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:51:55.680 --> 01:52:02.000
point well is yeah we don't officially it isn't&nbsp;
um but I mean yes I accept that there probably are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:08.960
you know operations and and and schemes that are&nbsp;
of that ilk and possibly there is an SS now yes&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:13.840
but I mean in terms of that what we know that we&nbsp;
can prove they don't exist anymore what we do know&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:19.280
about the past we can prove we hope we can prove&nbsp;
um and there has been an awful lot of of research&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:24.480
done on the SS that they were sort of everything&nbsp;
from a secret police force, which obviously does&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:29.760
link into the whole Big Brother agenda and the&nbsp;
potential for chipping people, which again I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:33.600
think resulted from concentration camps and&nbsp;
and and that was something they were thinking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:40.320
of doing then if that system had carried on um&nbsp;
to um to intelligence gathering. They obviously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:44.400
you know, gathered intelligence. And then there&nbsp;
was another side of the SS. But there was a more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:50.400
esoteric side that was definitely born out of&nbsp;
um of research from groups like the Chula and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:58.160
the real society who did have um a whole aran&nbsp;
race supremacy slant. Um taking that out of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:04.160
equation however they also looked into exceedingly&nbsp;
innovative technology. They had Shaburgger,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:09.840
they had you know a number of other people&nbsp;
nonJewish physics in other words. Yeah. Well&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:14.160
yes. Yes. I mean, I suppose I don't know if any&nbsp;
people who were Jewish were involved. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:18.640
there is also a lot of evidence that that&nbsp;
demonstrated there were an awful lot of Jewish,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:24.160
part Jewish uh members of the SS. And it does&nbsp;
look as though the SS was selective in terms of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:24.160 --> 01:53:28.640
who they felt they could use and who they felt&nbsp;
they couldn't. Um, and I think that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:28.640 --> 01:53:32.160
if you walk the walk and talk the talk and you&nbsp;
had a couple of Jewish grandparents, if you were&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:36.160
useful to the SS, they might have turned a blind&nbsp;
eye as long as you did what they told you and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:36.160 --> 01:53:40.880
would have been a file on you as well. So, they&nbsp;
you'd have done what you were told. Um yeah um&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:45.680
but I think that things like Camela I think is one&nbsp;
of the most interesting characters in the SS to go&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:50.960
into if anyone's interested seriously in looking&nbsp;
at this star. Um he basically took over from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:56.640
Hydrickch um a lot of the issues that Hydrickch&nbsp;
was overseeing primarily to do with the final&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:03.920
solution um but also the secret the more secret&nbsp;
research projects on um on propulsion systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:03.920 --> 01:54:07.600
Now at the time Hydrick was alive they weren't&nbsp;
really very well known. I mean they were still&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:14.800
in developmental stages. the Houndibu by that that&nbsp;
and Camela took over those duties from Hydrickch&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:20.080
and he became central figure in this Camela did&nbsp;
and he was alleged he died three times or well&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:23.760
there's there's three different Yes that's right&nbsp;
there's three different examples of his death one&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:28.080
one alleges that he was assassinated in Prague and&nbsp;
that's interesting because actually Hydrickch was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:32.480
um assassinated in Prague there's another one I&nbsp;
think that he went off to Argentina was it or one&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:37.120
of the you know South American states rather like&nbsp;
Ikeman did and then there was another one that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:42.800
disappeared or I don't know. The only connection&nbsp;
there was General George Patton. Okay. And he&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:42.800 --> 01:54:46.560
had to be assassinated because he knew too much.&nbsp;
That's an interesting one that I haven't picked&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:54.960
up on. And I also think Admiral Bird knew too&nbsp;
much. And he encountered the German British&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:59.600
Bird a year after Bird. I didn't know that. But&nbsp;
Admiral Bird obviously went out with a number&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:03.680
of battleships and and turned around pretty damn&nbsp;
quick and said went back to Washington and said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:07.120
"Look, the next time we have a war, we're going&nbsp;
to be dealing with craft that can fly from pole&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:13.120
to pole in minutes." Um, and and they shut him up&nbsp;
because I've interviewed a guy called John Irwin&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:21.200
who witnessed two German descriptive saucers in&nbsp;
the Jordanian Assyrian desert area until 1959.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:25.120
The original Hound of Technology. And when you&nbsp;
when you go back to look, I mean, there's very&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:30.000
little around about Maria Ortish. And there's also&nbsp;
complications about how her name is spelled. A&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:35.680
lot of people spell it Orick. O R S I C. I don't&nbsp;
believe it was that. I believe it was Ortish. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:42.800
I was always told, well, so people can research&nbsp;
her if they want to. Maria Ortish. A U S T I C,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:42.800 --> 01:55:50.000
I think. Um, or A U T I S C. Apologies for that.&nbsp;
Um, but I mean again she was a real medium and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:56.160
she is the one who allegedly channeled the houndu&nbsp;
blueprints or or certainly the instructions. Was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:01.120
it anything to do with an alleged an alleged crash&nbsp;
in Germany in the 30s? There is an allegation&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:04.480
involved with that. I don't know about Maronei&nbsp;
obviously of course was involved with Cornwall&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:09.520
because you've got the Maronei station. I mean&nbsp;
crucially to do with broadcasting and yes well&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:13.440
that's a possibility. I mean again I haven't&nbsp;
looked into that. Um, but I mean there certainly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:19.600
is a rumor that that that in 1936 a a craft did&nbsp;
crash in the Bavarian forest and that that's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:25.280
where Hitler got hold of the technology, you know,&nbsp;
that they're sort of see having UFO experiences,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:30.080
you know, and they're coming out with stuff&nbsp;
about Nazis. There's a sudden dramatic increase&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:35.920
in people wanting to read about Nazi UFOs. It's&nbsp;
really becoming quite, you know, a hot topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:39.920
There's a new film. There's a new film coming&nbsp;
out, Iron Sky. Now, that's a comedy. Obviously,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:44.320
it's it's being but it's like the Nazis went to&nbsp;
the moon in in 1945 and now they've done they've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:44.320 --> 01:56:47.840
got their technology now they're coming back to&nbsp;
get their planet back and you know so there's all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:53.280
of that coming out as well and it does seem like&nbsp;
this is the next stage you know you've had the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:58.640
whole grays everyone knows the gray image now I&nbsp;
mean everyone's familiar with that whether or not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:56:58.640 --> 01:57:03.520
we can what are the gray images because I've had&nbsp;
information of a particular type of gray which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:09.120
controlling major elements of sky television you&nbsp;
see I don't I couldn't possibly comment on any of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:15.280
It's a type of gray with a walnut. Okay.&nbsp;
Headed a headed skull. Walnut shell type&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:20.480
skull with a very thick rimmed ridge down where&nbsp;
the two halves of skull join. Okay. The um we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:25.840
talking about the the mid-cranial bone ridge&nbsp;
here uh where um the center of the skull joins&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:30.240
together. That's because the two halves of the&nbsp;
brain are completely isolated. Is that correct?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:37.600
in the what's known as the zeta reticular&nbsp;
zeta reticulent or the gray. Um the shape of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:43.920
the brain is split in half by a mid-cranial&nbsp;
bone ridge. The zeta reticulent's brain is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:50.640
uh not connected. The two halves of the brain&nbsp;
are split uh by a solid ridge of calcium right&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:57.600
down the middle of the skull. And it's interesting&nbsp;
that um couple of years after uh being told that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:03.760
uh Puerto Rican drawing is I read the Spanish&nbsp;
language and I started subscribing to a Spanish&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:10.480
language magazine from Puerto Rico and uh one of&nbsp;
the uh UFO witnesses drew an alien gray as having&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:16.480
a midcranial bone ridge quite distinct line down&nbsp;
the middle of the heads to make sure he conveyed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:23.760
what he had seen. So it's a very interesting&nbsp;
correspondence there. uh do think Martin's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:31.600
uh evidencia of is a very useful reservoir of&nbsp;
information for people who want to get sportive&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:38.640
data albeit it is in Spanish. Nevertheless, for&nbsp;
people to see exactly the same thing on a highly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:47.200
isolated island out in the middle of the Atlantic&nbsp;
Ocean is uh surely quite strange. But with regards&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:47.200 --> 01:58:53.040
to Ron, I mean I'm fascinated in Ron. Um, but&nbsp;
what happened to Ron? What happened to Ron? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:56.880
I mean, that's a really interesting question.&nbsp;
What was Ron? What did he do? What did Ron do? Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:58:56.880 --> 01:59:03.840
I met Ron when I started um a UFO special&nbsp;
interest group with Mensah when I was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:10.000
member of Mensah. Um, and I wanted to get people&nbsp;
with brain power to look at the situation and for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:14.800
a while it happened and Ron was one of the ones&nbsp;
that offered to help me run the newsletter. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:20.720
now Ron lived quite locally to me. This was in&nbsp;
North London. He, this is all I know of Ron. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:27.680
originally ran an esoteric bookshop in um Hibbury&nbsp;
um in Islington. Um I don't know when he closed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:34.720
that, but he was a Crowley. He believed very much&nbsp;
in Alistister Crowley. Um he was also an amateur&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:41.760
radio enthusiast and very skilled with that and&nbsp;
was very big into sort of finding I you know more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:47.360
about this than me because I'm not a radio buff&nbsp;
at all, but Scalar wave. Yeah. Over the Horizon,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:52.400
Woodpecker signal, which we filmed all those years&nbsp;
ago, short before he died. That's right. And he&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:58.000
was starting to to come out with this stuff and&nbsp;
and starting to to really talk about it and and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:02.720
he had an interesting background and and actually&nbsp;
the thing that that this is interesting that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:08.640
bring Ron up because it is down to Ron. This&nbsp;
started with me. I wanted to find out if I had&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:14.160
been abducted by a UFO because I was having all&nbsp;
these experiences and dreams and what have you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:19.440
that led to to my becoming quite overenthusiastic&nbsp;
and probably making a total idiot of myself,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:19.440 --> 02:00:24.320
but that's just how things worked out. Um, and&nbsp;
I said to Ron, "You really have got to help me&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:29.600
find out what's going on." So he said, "Look,&nbsp;
I'll hypnotize you." Yes. I said, "You know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:33.920
I don't mind you doing that because I trusted&nbsp;
him." And he hypnotized me and all I did was come&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:39.440
out with stuff about Hitler. all I just came out&nbsp;
with all this stuff about Hitler and the SS and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:44.400
and I don't remember all of it because he didn't&nbsp;
record it. He didn't write it all down, but he got&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:49.600
extremely engrossed in what I was saying. And it&nbsp;
wasn't that night, but it was a few weeks later&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:54.720
where he actually told me that he looked into some&nbsp;
of what I'd said. And he had this little sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:59.680
esoteric book that came from Germany. Um, and it&nbsp;
was all in German. And I don't understand German,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:00:59.680 --> 02:01:04.400
but I understood enough to know that what he was&nbsp;
pointing out to me was true. And as he was reading&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:10.400
and translating it to me that you know it was from&nbsp;
what my limited knowledge of German and it looked&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:16.720
certainly looked as though a lot of what I had&nbsp;
alleged about the kind of experiences Hitler had&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:21.920
um and say what those were. Well, yeah. I mean,&nbsp;
again, you know, I can't prove or disprove this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:26.640
um, but I can throw it out there and somebody&nbsp;
else might know, um, that Hitler had visitations&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:33.680
in the night from tall blonde beings, that&nbsp;
Hitler, um, was basically in a nightmare state,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:39.760
that he was completely a fever pitch by this and&nbsp;
and it completely engulfed him, and he had all&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:45.360
these really kind of strange beliefs about being&nbsp;
chosen to do something in particular and to bring&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:52.080
in this new world and all of that with, you know,&nbsp;
this this alternative technology, free energy,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:57.440
all of that kind of stuff. Um, and you know,&nbsp;
that's basically what it was. And because the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:02.560
first question, excuse me, that Ron had asked me&nbsp;
is, you know, have you, you know, not have you,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:08.640
um, you know, can you tell me, you know, what's&nbsp;
happened to you in terms of UFOs and, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:14.480
and do you have any sort of recall about having&nbsp;
an experience with a UFO? And I and I laughed and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:18.480
said, "No, well, they're not going to to bother&nbsp;
with me because I know too much about it anyway."&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:24.880
And proceeded to talk about Hitler and the SS.&nbsp;
What was talking about in the SS? What? It was&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:24.880 --> 02:02:28.160
basically saying that most UFOs weren't even&nbsp;
alien. They're not going to bother abducting&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:32.720
somebody who was involved back then and who&nbsp;
knew what was going on and and I didn't make the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:37.760
connection. You know, I I just We're referring&nbsp;
to Nazi flying saucers. We're referring to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:42.000
Houndibu and the Real Society and the Chula,&nbsp;
which I knew very little about in those days.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:48.320
You're talking 1994. There was very little&nbsp;
about any of that. I think the the video&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:53.840
Secrets of the Third Reich Secrets of the Third&nbsp;
Reich came out around I think. Yeah, I think he&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:58.560
was around already. Michael Herman. Yeah. But I&nbsp;
mean that it was only literally I hadn't seen it&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:05.680
at that point. Um because it was after that that&nbsp;
I went and bought it. Um when I saw it. So yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:11.600
Um but yeah, it was just basically that. Um,&nbsp;
and then of course Ron and I being, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:15.840
that we were very interested in in the situation&nbsp;
anyway, we just used to sort of talk about stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:21.920
that went on back in the war and he he he he felt&nbsp;
stuff that went on. Well, with the final solution&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:27.040
mainly and again it was I didn't really see what&nbsp;
was the purpose of the final solution. What really&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:33.280
was the purpose of it? Oh my god, that's a diff&nbsp;
how can anyone say an awful lot of people? Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:33.280 --> 02:03:37.760
there's some horrible theories. There's some&nbsp;
horrible theories. What is the theory? the this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:42.880
not my this is not my theory. Okay, this is not my&nbsp;
theory just to categorically state that. I've been&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:50.080
doing some research and I found everything ranging&nbsp;
from it was a sacrifice that the um there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:56.000
there's a website that I found the other day that&nbsp;
alleged that the the actual camps, concentration&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:02.480
camps formed particular sacred geometry shapes&nbsp;
and and various other things and that that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:08.480
was some kind of an organized Yes. Yes. That&nbsp;
that is the implication. Does this all seem to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:14.320
be pointing to that level into some other this is&nbsp;
this is the implication and of course you know one&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:19.280
wonders whether there is some kind of an agenda&nbsp;
with another race of beings who potentially did&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:26.560
give technology in return for this soul energy.&nbsp;
out to bring in Can I bring in Well, I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:31.040
anything about them and I don't I don't usually&nbsp;
sort of Yeah, the Anunnaki. I do I think of them&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:31.040 --> 02:04:34.800
as the Anunnaki because I've read stitching.&nbsp;
So, I suppose that's where I kind of came from&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:42.960
with that. But my friend um basically alleges that&nbsp;
that they are stuck in the she says it's they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:49.280
stuck in the fifth dimension. Apparently, they&nbsp;
falsely ascended themselves with monotomic gold.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:54.000
um and they're stuck. They basically be ascended&nbsp;
without going through the the process that you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:57.680
supposed to to get there. Again, my friend&nbsp;
says that we are multi-dimensional, but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:04:57.680 --> 02:05:02.800
whole point is to bring all the aspects from all&nbsp;
the dimensions into the one you are now. Yes. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:02.800 --> 02:05:06.800
that you that's what Chris Thomas said. Yes, I&nbsp;
know. Because I looked at Chris Thomas. I thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:11.680
that's exactly what my friend says. So I trust&nbsp;
that because I trust my friend and that's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:11.680 --> 02:05:16.640
process that I've been going through myself which&nbsp;
is why integrating some of my past life aspects&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:21.920
has been pretty hard. I was blown away by some of&nbsp;
what he said. Some of it I I didn't resonate with,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:24.800
but then that's the same with everything, you&nbsp;
know. You don't you resonate with some stuff&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:24.800 --> 02:05:31.040
you don't with others. And but I felt that there&nbsp;
was a hell of a lot of truth in the truest sense&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:31.040 --> 02:05:36.560
about what he said. Um, and I felt very much that&nbsp;
that this is a truth that actually could appeal&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:40.720
to the ordinary person on the street because it's&nbsp;
nothing you have to become a particular guru or&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:46.000
Buddha to actually experience. All you got to do&nbsp;
is really find who you are. It's quite simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:52.160
My own personal theory, however crazy it sounds,&nbsp;
is that, you know, we can affect our reality by&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:58.880
our state of consciousness. And I don't think is&nbsp;
this my take on this is that our our consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:03.520
is being deliberately manipulated. So we do&nbsp;
possibly that's a strong point. I mean that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:03.520 --> 02:06:08.720
that is a very strong possibility. Yeah. That you&nbsp;
know that directly engineering reality and this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:13.840
well this is again this is again the whole concept&nbsp;
of creating one's reality with consciousness. If&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:13.840 --> 02:06:18.800
people are feeling like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] excuse my language,&nbsp;
you know, they are going to respond accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:18.800 --> 02:06:23.600
We're talking about scuttlers right now. Do&nbsp;
you know them as scuttlers? I've never known&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:23.600 --> 02:06:29.280
them as scuttlers because they scuttle.&nbsp;
Black spider crab type things. Yes. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:29.280 --> 02:06:36.160
what happened? What did we see? Well, before&nbsp;
I had an extremely weird experience in 1999,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:40.240
which I do not know whether it had a lot of weird&nbsp;
experiences. I've had a hell of a lot of weird&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:47.520
experiences. Weird. How weird is it? This was off&nbsp;
the scale weird because I can't explain any of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:51.920
Um, you know, I can't even really explain it with&nbsp;
psychology because I went to see psychologists and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:51.920 --> 02:06:56.880
none of them said that there was anything wrong&nbsp;
with me. No, the trouble the trouble is that there&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:06:56.880 --> 02:07:00.000
was nothing wrong with me. That's the problem. I&nbsp;
wanted there to be something wrong with me so I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:03.520
could take a pill and make it go away. But, but&nbsp;
they could, you know, there was nothing wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:06.960
And because I was, you know, getting this whole&nbsp;
load of information about what was happening in&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:06.960 --> 02:07:11.200
Bosnia and and every week I was predicting what&nbsp;
was going to happen next. I kind of proved to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:16.720
psychologists that that precognition is real.&nbsp;
So actually he was very interested in me. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:23.360
but what we had before this strange experience&nbsp;
that involved a signal going into my ear and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:27.680
playing out of that's blue bean thing. I have no&nbsp;
idea. This is the thing. I need to find this out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:27.680 --> 02:07:34.000
But but before that happened, we had my partner&nbsp;
and I, my then partner and I had a whole load of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:37.920
nighttime visitations by something that made&nbsp;
a noise under the bed. And I thought we had&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:45.520
a mouse or a rat. Um, and you know, my exartner&nbsp;
went under the bed when we heard this one night,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:50.240
screamed his head off. He wasn't the kind of&nbsp;
man to be prone to flights of fancy at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:55.920
He said there was something black, like a crab&nbsp;
under the bed. Uh, and he said it just shot past&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:59.680
him. He was terrified. We were both went under&nbsp;
the bed at that point and and with a torch and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:08.240
nothing was there. Um then the following night my&nbsp;
youngest son saw it in his room. Um my eldest son&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:08.240 --> 02:08:14.160
uh who was young at the time um saw it in his room&nbsp;
and we um What did he see? He saw a similar thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:14.160 --> 02:08:19.360
He described it as being like a black hand moving&nbsp;
around on its own. So it sounds very similar to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:19.360 --> 02:08:26.080
what you saw. And that was about a week or so&nbsp;
before I had this hugely dramatic experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:31.360
which did feel like a complete altering of&nbsp;
my reality. I must admit reality. It was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:37.200
reality reality. Well, it was it was the most&nbsp;
bizarre thing. I was actually in the grounds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:42.160
the place where my very wellressearched past&nbsp;
life had lived. And I didn't realize it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:42.160 --> 02:08:46.800
my past life at the time at all. I had no inkling&nbsp;
whatsoever. Wasn't interested in past lives in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:46.800 --> 02:08:53.120
slightest. But I took a step and as I took this&nbsp;
step, I heard this God almighty clunking noise&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:58.960
and it sounded like a big vault being opened. It&nbsp;
sort of went like that like a big like a massive&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:06.880
vault being open metallic. It went clockwise. It&nbsp;
sound the sound went clockwise around me. It went&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:13.600
like that like a kind of big metal seal opening.&nbsp;
And simultaneously as this happened, there was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:18.800
ripple of light that went all the way around the&nbsp;
trees and made everything look really fluid. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:24.880
it also felt at exactly the same time that my&nbsp;
spirit had literally flipped around in my body.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:30.080
call it fluidic reality. I don't know what a&nbsp;
fluidic space. But anyway, I just I said looked&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:34.560
at my partner and said, "Did you hear anything?"&nbsp;
He's like, "No." And I was like, "Okay." Feeling&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:38.880
very very scared by it because it's about one of&nbsp;
the only times that I've ever had something that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:43.520
no one else heard or or could see cuz you know&nbsp;
when I've seen UFOs, there's been other people&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:48.000
there and even when I had the strange channeling&nbsp;
that, you know, it corresponded with a lot of what&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:53.840
Barry King said. So, I've always been able to&nbsp;
verify the things that I've had. And I couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:58.800
verify that at all. That was completely something&nbsp;
that I had no understanding or comprehension of.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:02.480
And it was after that happened, a couple of days&nbsp;
after that happened, that I had this signal going&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:09.280
into my ear. Um, and it basically, what was it&nbsp;
like? What was it sounded like white noise like,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:13.280
you know, going into and it literally went into&nbsp;
my ear. You know, sometimes when you pick up the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:17.120
telephone and you listen to your computer. Yeah.&nbsp;
Like it did sound like a modem kind of thing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:22.720
like an oldfashioned Yeah. Yeah. So, I don't&nbsp;
know why they take that, but but of course,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:28.400
James Casbalt has alleged that that there's some&nbsp;
that I'm involved in in one of these programs at&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:33.040
Brecon Beacons, and I would like clarification on&nbsp;
that. Really? Okay. You're talking to James Casp&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:38.560
or Michael Prince. What exactly do you want&nbsp;
to say to him or about that program? I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:38.560 --> 02:10:41.760
know anything about it. I mean, I don't honestly&nbsp;
don't know anything about it. I I know that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:49.280
Breham Beacons is a military facility. it's SAS&nbsp;
training and things like that, but James has gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:56.080
or Michael Prince has has elaborated more recently&nbsp;
and he is alleging that that there's a lot of SS&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:03.280
stuff going on. Um, and I don't know if that's a&nbsp;
part of it. Um, I'd be very interested to talk to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:09.200
him about that. Um, I really would because I want&nbsp;
to get things straight in my mind about the SS,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:09.200 --> 02:11:15.360
about what's going on, what's what potentially&nbsp;
started back in the Third Reich, um, and what,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:19.520
you know, potentially is still happening now.&nbsp;
So, that's something I would be very interested&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:27.040
to talk to him about. But he has alleged that um,&nbsp;
that there is a clone of me and he said on one of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:32.640
these forums and I can't remember which one it&nbsp;
was. I never probably Yes, I think it was. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:32.640 --> 02:11:39.200
it was Avalon, I think. and and he said that it's&nbsp;
this clone of me is called Proax something with&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:49.920
um with numbers after it. What numbers? Didn't&nbsp;
say, but the post is up. Proact P R Oyphen AX.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:55.600
And I I honestly don't know. I mean, all I can say&nbsp;
is that when I wrote when I had that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:11:55.600 --> 02:12:01.280
whole thing going on, I wrote that that vanity&nbsp;
published fact-based fiction about the grays.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:08.000
um that in the dreams I was getting I was having&nbsp;
very high level conversations with what appeared&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:15.680
to be high-ranking military personnel of what US&nbsp;
yes American yes they weren't British where we&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:19.840
having these conversations in some kind of base&nbsp;
I mean but these were dreams you know I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:24.320
to make that distinction I don't know if this is&nbsp;
real or whether it happened right but but that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:29.440
but the dream I mean the last dream I had was&nbsp;
it was almost like you know massive debriefing&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:36.320
between me and these generals and and I was being&nbsp;
treated on their level in this dream. This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:43.840
what's so strange. Any location recently? No. God,&nbsp;
no. This is going back to before I spoke to Barry&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:53.920
King. Jesus, you're going back 92 90 uh middle&nbsp;
94. It was around about summer 94. September I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:58.560
think it was. Do you have anything you want to say&nbsp;
to Barry then just to round this off? Well, yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:04.800
I mean it's you know I'm I'd love to catch up with&nbsp;
him actually. Um I'd be very interested and how is&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:10.800
he a bit ill. We remember talking to him yesterday&nbsp;
but uh he wasn't able to do well give him my very&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:16.400
best wishes. Um and you know obviously apologies&nbsp;
for the fact that I did get quite excited in that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:20.880
early video. I mean it was excited I suppose what&nbsp;
was really and there's an awful lot in that video&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:26.480
which is even more important but I was talking&nbsp;
to Barry on Skype the other day. He was saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:31.520
that he put more information into the documents&nbsp;
and people need to look at the documents that he&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:36.880
was released and that's why the documents are&nbsp;
available on on basis 2 take two. If you put&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:36.880 --> 02:13:44.080
the disc one into the computer and don't look at&nbsp;
it as a DVD but look at as an ordinary data disc&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:49.200
entire scan of the voice. Yeah, I've still got&nbsp;
all my hard copies of the voice and there is a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:54.160
lot of information in there. He's saying that he&nbsp;
got more information out than he wasn't allowed&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:58.960
to within the voice. Okay, that's the last&nbsp;
thing he said to me the other day. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:02.880
certainly that's the first time I've spoken to&nbsp;
him since 2001. Well, certainly from my point&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:08.800
of view as somebody who experienced phenomena that&nbsp;
I couldn't explain, meeting Barry, which is again&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:08.800 --> 02:14:14.480
why I was enthusiastic. Meeting Barry was, you&nbsp;
know, amazing because I could, it was like, wo,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:18.960
you know, this is like, oh my god, you know, this&nbsp;
man is kind of coming from a completely different&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:24.400
place to me. He hasn't had all the dreams and&nbsp;
the psychic stuff, you know, but he's kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:24.400 --> 02:14:28.880
confirming what I've been led to believe. And I&nbsp;
suppose that in a way you do get a bit sort of,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:28.880 --> 02:14:34.480
oh my god. Well, it is here, is it? It is. It's a&nbsp;
It's a very big thing. It's a very big deal. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:34.480 --> 02:14:39.120
I was young, you know. Um and I and I do sort&nbsp;
of, you know, think that perhaps I got a bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:46.000
overenthusiastic about it. And there's a machine&nbsp;
in there that's and they start seeing projected&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:55.440
reactivated uh dead German soldiers, right? And&nbsp;
they reanimate. Wow. And they also reanimate and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:14:55.440 --> 02:15:01.120
come out of existence. They just suddenly just&nbsp;
appear. And their task is to protect the outpost.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:07.600
Well, that sounds very similar to what Ron Adams&nbsp;
suggested was at Coped Hall. Cop hall. Yes. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:12.960
we went to. And he mentioned this thing like a&nbsp;
v a vending machine. He mentioned that there was&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:17.440
a machine that was like a, you know, looked like&nbsp;
a vending machine, but it effectively, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:23.600
did, you know, make kind of reanimated.&nbsp;
No, we never we never got that. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:27.600
he said that that that it triggered stuff off&nbsp;
and then all of a sudden military people would&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:32.800
turn up. That's what I remember him saying. I&nbsp;
mean, I might have got part any more in there&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:38.480
because this is very important. All I remember&nbsp;
when we went there, we obviously saw my camera&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:43.040
started failing at I know it did. I know it did.&nbsp;
But but he said that there'd been this rumor of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:43.040 --> 02:15:51.280
of you know this machine that was like a vending&nbsp;
machine um that had been seen there or that people&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:51.280 --> 02:15:57.280
had known to existed there that it was involved&nbsp;
with some kind of secret project and that whenever&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:15:57.280 --> 02:16:03.040
this thing was there if you went there basically&nbsp;
military people would turn up. Now I remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:09.840
when we went there just arrive out of nowhere&nbsp;
and see you off you know get rid of you. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:09.840 --> 02:16:15.440
which happened like protect. Yeah, which happened&nbsp;
to us. Yes, it did happen to us. We were seen off&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:15.440 --> 02:16:20.320
in no uncertain terms. Somebody turned up. Nobody&nbsp;
was around, but somebody turned up in a Land Rover&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:25.200
if I remember rightly. I don't know. I think it&nbsp;
was a Land Rover. It was something. It wasn't a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:25.200 --> 02:16:29.760
military vehicle, but it was a sort of, you know,&nbsp;
it could have been sort of it could have looked a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:33.920
bit paramilitary to me. The whole thing about&nbsp;
the guy looked paramilitary to me. Yeah. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:40.640
he definitely was military. Yeah, definitely had&nbsp;
Yeah, he had links to that and he just turned up&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:45.600
out of thin air when we were there filming and&nbsp;
and got very interested in why we were there and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:50.800
and that's that's when Ron was actually quite a&nbsp;
decent head. He looked healthy and yeah, Ron it&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:56.960
wasn't very long before he died actually. So what&nbsp;
what happened about the story about about Ron? The&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:02.880
earring his earring he's wearing is a skull with&nbsp;
a little snake a skull on the top of a snake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:09.200
most interesting odd symbol, you know, for an&nbsp;
earring. In what respect? Well, they're definitely&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:20.319
sort of occultings or whatever. Esoteric,&nbsp;
for want of a better word. You're not there.

02:17:20.319 --> 02:17:28.000
That was very interesting, wasn't it?

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:33.920
No. He's faster than military.

02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:40.560
I think we interviewed Ron and uh we did the&nbsp;
scale wave thing then went off to Rishion I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:40.560 --> 02:17:46.880
think I think that day and he died. He died. He&nbsp;
rang me up actually um a couple of weeks before&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:51.840
he died. He was getting very very paranoid, very&nbsp;
frightened. What happened to Ron? What happened&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:51.840 --> 02:17:57.040
to Ron? What do you know about his history with&nbsp;
I don't know very much about his history with&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:17:57.040 --> 02:18:01.359
Rendles because we never talked about that.&nbsp;
We talked about the Third Reich, which he&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:01.359 --> 02:18:07.519
was extremely involved with in terms of his own&nbsp;
research. Um, but he phoned me up and he he got&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:12.241
really frightened and he said, "Look," he said,&nbsp;
"Something's going to happen to me." He said,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:16.559
"They're coming more and more," meaning grays,&nbsp;
because that's what he was having, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:16.560 --> 02:18:21.920
experiences with. He said, "Something's going to&nbsp;
happen to me." Now, his wife had said that he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:21.920 --> 02:18:26.960
getting to the point where he actually wanted to&nbsp;
turn his study into a Faraday cage. He wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:31.359
put chicken wire all the way around it because&nbsp;
he felt that was the only way that they couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:31.359 --> 02:18:38.799
get at him. Now she was very worried about he's an&nbsp;
esoteric specialist. Yes, he was. So he would have&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:46.720
known of all forms of protection and crystals and&nbsp;
salts and all sorts of other things. He was he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:53.520
a true occultist and he was then reduced to the&nbsp;
stage of using chicken wire to protect himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:18:53.520 --> 02:19:00.161
He was that frightened. He was that something&nbsp;
was frightening him or something was making him&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:04.240
paranoid. I don't you know I mean he he seemed he&nbsp;
didn't seem paranoid to me when I spoke to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:09.200
His wife felt that he was but obviously she was&nbsp;
with him all the time. Well that's the impression&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:15.200
she gave me. But I mean that was that was the&nbsp;
implication that he felt that something was out to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:20.479
get him. He said that's it. They're going to get&nbsp;
me. Now he had mentioned that he thought he had an&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:20.479 --> 02:19:25.679
implant. And of course, I tried to calm him down&nbsp;
by saying, "No, they won't. They won't." Because,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:29.600
you know, what else can you say, you know, when&nbsp;
you've got somebody really upset on the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:33.360
you know, somebody you really care about, too.&nbsp;
Cuz I did, you know, not over what period of time&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:33.359 --> 02:19:37.519
did this happen? This happened 2 weeks before he&nbsp;
died. Approximately 2 weeks before he died. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:41.600
which would have been a week or so after I did the&nbsp;
interview. Yeah, it was it was Yeah, exactly. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:47.281
was within weeks that all this happened. Um, and&nbsp;
and that was it. The next thing I knew, you rang&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:55.359
me and said, "Mom's dead." And I was absolutely&nbsp;
flabbergasted by that. I was complet I felt I felt&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:19:55.359 --> 02:20:00.960
also like I failed him because obviously I was&nbsp;
you know I didn't I didn't really believe that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:07.760
that he was as in as much risk as he felt he was.&nbsp;
Um but I didn't know about the Bentwaters thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:07.760 --> 02:20:13.760
The Adams family is a family I met around&nbsp;
about 1994 and they were the only civilian&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:13.760 --> 02:20:24.560
family to have lived in US Air Force headwaters&nbsp;
from 1970 to 1976. They were um surrounded by&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:29.680
military personnel and were very friendly with&nbsp;
all of the military personnel. Uh they would go&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:29.680 --> 02:20:36.160
on all the dances, go to the all the Christmas&nbsp;
parties, birthday parties of children, all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:36.160 --> 02:20:44.000
um you see the new year in you know uh so from&nbsp;
1917 to 1976 they left in 1976 and Ron started&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:51.920
running a bookshop in Ivory in London. Uh the shop&nbsp;
is just a kind of supernatural orientation type of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:59.280
bookshop um in Ivory and Ron kept it going. But&nbsp;
I would think that the most uh important thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:20:59.280 --> 02:21:05.840
about the whole family is that Ron, his wife, his&nbsp;
two sons and a daughter-in-law all believed that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:05.840 --> 02:21:13.600
while during any stay at uh Yuru for Fetch Waters,&nbsp;
they were abducted by aliens. The whole family,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:13.600 --> 02:21:20.800
the whole lot. I talked to the wife. I talked to&nbsp;
Ron the father. I talked to one of the sons and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:28.080
uh the son indeed whose name I can't remember uh&nbsp;
was very traumatized and had an instantaneous fear&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:34.960
of terror of spiders. I think it was the younger&nbsp;
of the two sons. Uh he was the only one that I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:44.080
met when I was at Bronze uh in Chase Road in&nbsp;
1984. But he was uh very traumatized looking&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:49.760
in my opinion. He had a sudden fear of spiders&nbsp;
as I said after induction which is like another&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:56.000
abductee in Edinburgh that I've met saw you this&nbsp;
guy all of a sudden he whole whole life he's had&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:21:56.000 --> 02:22:01.600
an absolute terror of spiders to get on to the&nbsp;
family living away from US Air Force Bwaters&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:08.480
from 1976 to 1980 they carried on their connection&nbsp;
with US Air Force Bwaters personnel socially. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:08.479 --> 02:22:13.759
they carried on going to all the birthday parties&nbsp;
and all that. So I would say it's also interesting&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:21.040
that the daughter-in-law uh to obviously betrothed&nbsp;
to one of Ron Adam's sons coming from a completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:25.920
different family also stated that she thought&nbsp;
she'd had incredible experiences whilst staying&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:32.880
overnight in US Air Force Bwaters. uh she believed&nbsp;
that aliens had come through the walls and ran&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:32.880 --> 02:22:38.560
around her bed and that was very similar to what&nbsp;
Ton Adams wife was talking about whom I did speak&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:43.840
to personally but um I don't really see why two&nbsp;
completely separate families should be wanting to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:43.840 --> 02:22:50.880
claim the same thing which is utterly fantastic to&nbsp;
us then you know right now even in 2010 sounds too&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:50.880 --> 02:22:57.520
unbelievable too difficult to believe. Well, Ron&nbsp;
certainly was being abducted a hell of a lot and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:04.161
it worried him and it worried him enough to try&nbsp;
to put the grace off abducting him by smoking a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:04.160 --> 02:23:11.040
lot. Uh he would say to me that he was uh smoking&nbsp;
just simply to put the grays off to pollute his&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:11.040 --> 02:23:15.600
blood deliberately and make his blood useless&nbsp;
to the gray. So he definitely had this picture&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:15.600 --> 02:23:23.121
which I'd uh been told about a couple of years&nbsp;
before by another source who was MI5 connected and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:29.840
um Ron was uh smoking pretty badly and dangerously&nbsp;
just simply in terror of being abducted by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:36.160
grays. So we're a little bit suspicious that&nbsp;
Ron's death at the age of 65 while recorded as&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:36.160 --> 02:23:42.080
being of a heart attack does relate to his being&nbsp;
abducted by the aliens. be not beyond the kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:47.760
of conversations we'd all had together cuz when&nbsp;
we met privately to do the newsletter, we always&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:47.760 --> 02:23:55.120
ended up talking about the SS. It was bizarre. We&nbsp;
would talk about everything from from the ovens at&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:23:55.120 --> 02:24:01.439
Avitz to to you know to the sort of the howibu&nbsp;
which you know obviously we knew that they had&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:01.439 --> 02:24:06.160
flying discs. Yeah. didn't mention Bell that we&nbsp;
didn't you know that didn't come up at all but I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:11.760
mean it was like yes we both believed the Nazis&nbsp;
had these these machines these and that you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:17.520
these foo fighters were connected and things like&nbsp;
that and and theories about the Tibetans and about&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:23.600
how when when the allies stormed Berlin that's&nbsp;
the well apparent I don't I mean again you know&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:29.040
I don't know but I mean Madame Glavatzky went out&nbsp;
to Tibet um I know that and um you know we talked&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:34.720
a lot about Madame Bllovatzky and we talked a lot&nbsp;
about theosophy um and the the rumor that they&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:41.120
they found um you know Tibetan soldiers dressed&nbsp;
in SS uniforms in Berlin and again this this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:46.319
kind of flaky stuff you can't really verify a&nbsp;
lot of it you know I mean but I mean it is an&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:46.319 --> 02:24:50.799
interesting thing and we did used to spend quite&nbsp;
a long time talking about stuff like that and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:55.760
was it true you know we sort of both felt that it&nbsp;
probably was and we both felt that there was hell&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:24:55.760 --> 02:25:02.560
of a lot more than meets the eye about the whole&nbsp;
SS situation and that it all goes back there. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:07.440
always felt like it all went back to the SS. It&nbsp;
really did. But, you know, then I mean he actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:07.439 --> 02:25:12.479
I think he did imply to me that he that he cuz he&nbsp;
was obviously a lot older than me and I think he&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:12.479 --> 02:25:20.559
was born in in the late 40s. So, it's possible he&nbsp;
could have been a reincarnated person from that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:25.680
era. It is possible whether or not he I think&nbsp;
I'm sure he mentioned something like that once,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:31.520
but I can't be certain. But I know he's come back&nbsp;
into our consciousness. top of conversation now in&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:31.520 --> 02:25:36.241
the same way as some other people. Well, he's come&nbsp;
back to me very much because obviously since more&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:43.040
and more stuff has come to me about this SS stuff&nbsp;
of Nazis here, you know, um but but definitely a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:43.040 --> 02:25:50.640
lot of what is going on now in terms of secrets uh&nbsp;
secret um agendas and not so secret agendas um you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:50.640 --> 02:25:56.800
know initiatives to depopulate potentially like&nbsp;
Codex Elementaris and FEMA camps, fusion centers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:25:56.800 --> 02:26:03.840
a lot of the thing weather engineering, a lot of&nbsp;
that I believe goes back to the essay And I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:08.240
you could take it all all roads lead to Rome and&nbsp;
I think that you just got to go back to the SS&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:14.080
and we need to get more people who are prepared to&nbsp;
speak about what they know like you know my thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:18.800
called practical reality and practical reality&nbsp;
is very very interesting. I mean, I'm I'm very&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:22.800
interested in that because it did feel to me term&nbsp;
I came up with that. That's a good That's a good&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:27.520
term because it did feel like that. It felt when&nbsp;
I was going through my experience, it felt like&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:27.520 --> 02:26:32.161
I was simultaneously living in between three or&nbsp;
four different realities and that whichever way&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:32.160 --> 02:26:40.800
I went in terms of how I felt was going to affect&nbsp;
the wider, you know, the wider implications for&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:47.200
my life. I was basically choosing paths and they&nbsp;
would lead to different points. Um, so yeah, that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:55.040
that's kind of an interesting one. Okay. Any final&nbsp;
words this time? No, the information speaks for&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:01.200
itself. Is there any sort of one summation phrase&nbsp;
you want to get across? One, what's the what's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:06.319
bottom line? What's the what's the essence? It's&nbsp;
a dangerous situation, but it's all under control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:06.319 --> 02:27:12.000
People shouldn't panic. But should they read up&nbsp;
things, look up things, watch it? if they want&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:18.960
to do their own research, this is that will help&nbsp;
them. And where is the best place to stay across,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:27.680
stay tuned to deeper things. Um, again, they&nbsp;
can check out um the project IBIS information&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:35.440
if they just Google James Casbot Ibis. That's very&nbsp;
detailed. It's very there's a lot of data there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:35.439 --> 02:27:41.200
And the one of the things which which which I&nbsp;
get is is emails from a character very important&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:47.760
person called the Reverend Anthony J. Pike. Okay.&nbsp;
Anything you want to tell Mr. Pike? Lord St. Pike.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:47.760 --> 02:27:53.680
Anything honest? Tell any message you want to&nbsp;
say to Mr. Pike? Um why why have you pulled&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:53.680 --> 02:27:59.680
his name out out of everyone? Well, he's he he's&nbsp;
disappeared off. He said his saint his saintly um&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:27:59.680 --> 02:28:05.440
his saintly duties on earth had had finished. and&nbsp;
uh about 4 weeks ago I a couple of months ago and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:05.439 --> 02:28:10.240
he's off to a different planet but he's come back&nbsp;
so I thought we'd send him a welcoming message on&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:10.240 --> 02:28:17.760
YouTube to say you know Lord St. Anthony say hello&nbsp;
Anthony St. Anthony, God bless. Jehovah blesses&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:17.760 --> 02:28:25.120
Jehovah, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Cosmic research.&nbsp;
The chairman, Jehovah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He keeps&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:31.120
he keeps the world informed. Yeah. He's good.&nbsp;
Okay. He's got a good sense of humor. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:35.599
And anything for Barry? Barry? Yeah. You seen&nbsp;
Barry recently? We're a bit worried about No,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:35.600 --> 02:28:41.520
for Barry. No hard feelings. He He did what he&nbsp;
had to do. He's a bit ill now. I gather he's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:41.520 --> 02:28:50.161
not. Yeah. And I hope he gets better. And he no&nbsp;
hard feelings. He I know who he is and uh he he&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:28:50.160 --> 02:29:09.120
did what he had to do. Okay. Okay. Good luck.&nbsp;
God bless. Have mercy, Mr. Hall. Thanks, Miles.

02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:21.960
[Music] Yeah.

02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:32.559
[Music] Heat.

02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:42.560
[Music]

02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:48.241
After over 5 years, we now bring you the second&nbsp;
video interview with James Casbolt. In bases 4,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:53.439
Casmalt expanded on Barry King's material,&nbsp;
first released in bases 1 and two.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:29:53.439 --> 02:29:58.639
King talked about generated life forms,&nbsp;
horrendous mind and population control programs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:29:58.640 --> 02:30:03.680
mannequin and puppet master, all going on in&nbsp;
Britain's Barkshire countryside at a base under&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:09.040
the village of Peacemore. Casbolt highlighted&nbsp;
even more horrific programs involving children,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:09.040 --> 02:30:14.720
genetic experimentation, and further terrifying&nbsp;
details. And even a base under parliament itself&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:20.640
called CLC1. In bases two and four, a further&nbsp;
witness, Matt Todd, gave us even more detail&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:26.880
with the involvement of the US military in the&nbsp;
abductions or myabs and how he killed four grays&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:26.880 --> 02:30:33.760
at a base where people's souls were kept in cages.&nbsp;
Bases 7 gave a super soldier Dave Maro and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:40.000
trauma-induced monarch programming selected at&nbsp;
birth and trained to fight off planet. Perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:45.760
Matt Todd demonstrated radio signals coming from&nbsp;
his many implants. the existence of some other&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:45.760 --> 02:30:53.440
form of dimensional reality and a war with super&nbsp;
beings is implied. So now in bases 9 we present&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:30:53.439 --> 02:31:01.759
Michael Prince aka James Casbolt. This time the&nbsp;
SS comes into focus and the nightmare continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:09.440
That is if any of these claims can ever be&nbsp;
proved with factual evidential data. James&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:09.439 --> 02:31:19.839
Casbold. [Music] James, we met in a previous&nbsp;
persona as James on previous edition of uh the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:19.840 --> 02:31:27.360
basis series. You've got a different persona now&nbsp;
or you've got two different um ways you portray&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:27.359 --> 02:31:31.519
yourself to the public. Can you explain what the&nbsp;
difference is or why you've changed or has there&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:36.640
been a change? Michael Prince, James Carpool.&nbsp;
It's just a simple matter of I'm using the name,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:44.560
my birth name, Michael Prince. It's a name I&nbsp;
was given at birth by my biological mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:53.440
So So where where's the story of the Casbold&nbsp;
story? Um that was a family I was adopted into&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:31:53.439 --> 02:32:02.559
the Casbolt family. Yeah. So um that was um 81.&nbsp;
Yeah. I need to go back to the beginning when I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:14.480
was a baby. The origins of Project Ibis. Um it was&nbsp;
the name of the project I was um involved in uh or&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:14.479 --> 02:32:22.319
born into effectively um was named project&nbsp;
Ibis and it was run by the NSA and MI6 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:22.319 --> 02:32:34.240
um it was it was um tracking of 42 children&nbsp;
from different countries and um all those&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:40.000
children were brought to a facility in Canada&nbsp;
in the Rocky Mountains um underneath a small&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:48.000
town called Nelson. And in what what countries?&nbsp;
Why were they selected? Um according to the file&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:55.040
information I've seen, they were se selected&nbsp;
for cuz their DNA the um the NSA information&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:32:55.040 --> 02:33:05.519
I've seen um says that we have what they call&nbsp;
blood prime which um it states anunnaki DNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:05.520 --> 02:33:11.920
What is blood prime? What's what specifically are&nbsp;
the differences? I think some type of alien DNA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:20.800
human um alien hybrid. Is there any particular&nbsp;
Reese's negative positive or anything like that?&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:20.800 --> 02:33:30.560
Um I think it there's that the Reese's negative&nbsp;
factor in it. I think the the negative factor. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:34.800
that how are the ch children selected as such?&nbsp;
I mean does that mean there's some means of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:34.800 --> 02:33:40.960
uh selecting is it proclusive from different&nbsp;
you know at birth people's bloodline medical&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:47.600
records I think the mothers were um selected&nbsp;
and um the embryos were cloned embryos grown&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:55.840
in a artificial environment um test tube babies&nbsp;
and I think those from my understanding those&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:33:55.840 --> 02:34:04.720
um embryos were then implanted into specific women&nbsp;
who gave birth and And then at the time of birth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:04.720 --> 02:34:09.680
the children were transported to the um&nbsp;
underground facility at Nelson in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:09.680 --> 02:34:16.800
The name of that facility was a Q552. Where's&nbsp;
Nelson? Is it in Manito Winnipeg or somewhere?&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:30.080
That's a small town in the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp;
It's in uh British Columbia, Canada. um that

02:34:30.080 --> 02:34:37.680
so we were all taken there at the time of birth.&nbsp;
Some some from America I think. Um there was some&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:45.281
from South America obviously some from the UK. Um&nbsp;
I don't know who the other 42 children are. I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:52.479
got a rough idea now. Why 42? I don't know. Is&nbsp;
it just just that's what the sample was? a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:34:52.479 --> 02:35:02.240
significance in it. I don't know. I'm sure there's&nbsp;
massive shoulders. Um, very blonde hair going&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:10.639
almost white now cuz he's getting a bit older.&nbsp;
Um, wears your classic MIB outfit, the fedora hat.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:10.640 --> 02:35:18.720
That's his style of dress. There's the fedora hat,&nbsp;
black suit. Um, piercing blue eyes. Has a scar&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:18.720 --> 02:35:25.520
down his left side. That's from the officer class&nbsp;
from fighting. I'm not sure where he got the scar.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:25.520 --> 02:35:32.720
Um, this guy amazing guy. The characteristic of&nbsp;
German upper class is to have a a a scar. That's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:38.640
interesting. From sword fighting. It's interesting&nbsp;
you say that. I didn't know that. Um, very&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:38.640 --> 02:35:44.800
interesting character. He um from Bavaria, close&nbsp;
friends with Henry Kissinger. Henry Kissinger also&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:44.800 --> 02:35:50.400
from Bavaria. who seems to have an amazing ability&nbsp;
to stay young and healthy, relatively speaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:50.399 --> 02:35:57.599
Um, Alfred Bonner was the director of uh, security&nbsp;
at Duly at the time of the Duly rescue. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:35:57.600 --> 02:36:02.400
there's been a book published by Pilington, I&nbsp;
think it is. Um, I could stand correcting saying&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:02.399 --> 02:36:07.519
the whole Doulsece thing is a fraud. They've stuck&nbsp;
bits on the mountain to make it look as if what's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:07.520 --> 02:36:13.440
going on. No, Dulce is real. Dolce is 100% there.&nbsp;
So, I mean, why do you think there'd be elements&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:13.439 --> 02:36:20.080
within MI5 publishing books saying this stuff's&nbsp;
wrong and it's shadows and it's it's a it's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:20.080 --> 02:36:27.120
fraud. I'm not really interested in the whole it's&nbsp;
in your recent book has been published. Um, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:27.120 --> 02:36:33.519
know, I'm not really interested in all that. It's&nbsp;
I know it's DOS is real. It's um it's a important&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:39.360
place for the new world order. So, what's what's&nbsp;
the function of Dulce? I mean, we've heard that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:39.359 --> 02:36:44.960
there certain underground things in it which&nbsp;
were released in the late '7s. Is there anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:52.560
new about it? Is it current? I don't I've got a&nbsp;
friend um in the CIA who works at Oakidge National&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:36:52.560 --> 02:37:02.960
Laboratories in Tennessee and he often works down&nbsp;
at Dulce. Um I mean he sent me pictures of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:08.720
first level color photographs and it's not really&nbsp;
the first level isn't high tech. It's kind of just&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:15.281
a damp old base, you know, like sort of it's a bit&nbsp;
run down the first level. Not what you'd expect&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:20.240
to see at all. The old elevator shafts and things.&nbsp;
Are you able to try those pictures at all? Yeah, I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:25.599
can. I've um I think they were released on Project&nbsp;
Avalon a couple of years back, right? I can show&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:33.040
you those pictures. Um you know, but when you go&nbsp;
down the levels, it does get more advanced down&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:33.040 --> 02:37:40.560
there. It's a essentially um Have you been down to&nbsp;
those levels or have you been shown them? Um there&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:48.720
is connections with um IBIS and Dulce Doulsece&nbsp;
is essentially a um officially it's a psychiatry&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:58.160
center. Um they when the um employees walk around&nbsp;
the facility, there's certain sections with&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:04.800
um people in like hospital rooms with um almost&nbsp;
like prison rooms in a way, but not with bars,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:12.480
like um plastic windows and thick plastic. And&nbsp;
um you know, you have people there in in hospital&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:12.479 --> 02:38:20.799
gowns and um sitting on their beds and it the the&nbsp;
briefing is that they're um incurably insane and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:27.280
that they're doing high-risk um drug treatments&nbsp;
on the insane and it's actually a top secret&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:34.559
um psychiatry facility. That's what they're&nbsp;
first told when they go in there. So uh and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:42.480
then they they never come out these people. Yeah.&nbsp;
Um I think a lot of them don't come out. There's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:42.479 --> 02:38:51.839
um as you go the hall these particular hallways&nbsp;
um at these rooms in um the corridor curved round&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:57.600
and every kind of 12 rooms you have an operating&nbsp;
theater. These people are taken out as operating&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:07.520
theaters there. And uh the Q552 facility in&nbsp;
Canada in Nelson was um there was a lot of uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:14.720
Nazi psychiatry um going on there. What sort of&nbsp;
what are you talking about conditioning? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:23.680
for instance um at the facility they were um it&nbsp;
was essentially a trauma center. Now they did a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:23.680 --> 02:39:28.320
lot of conditioning with us with wild animals&nbsp;
and what they were doing there they they used&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:28.319 --> 02:39:38.080
um Canadian wolves, they used snakes, they used&nbsp;
um cats, wild cats and tigers and things. Um they&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:46.960
were giving us the attributes of wild animals. Um&nbsp;
they were subjecting us to um um for when we were&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:54.319
older um for allterrain warfare, jungle warfare,&nbsp;
artic warfare. So we had the attributes of wild&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:39:54.319 --> 02:40:02.399
animal. How do you get the attribute of a wild&nbsp;
animal? They used um they set up I think it was&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:02.399 --> 02:40:15.679
the second level down at the Q552. Um they set up&nbsp;
a kind of pen. Um 30 ft 30 ft wide. Um they set up&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:15.680 --> 02:40:23.760
this pen. They put the babies in the pen and um&nbsp;
they put wild animals in the pen. They might put&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:30.000
snakes in there or you know wolves. Only one type&nbsp;
of animal at a time. They didn't mix the animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:36.640
There was always one type. Now this um pen was&nbsp;
very similar to a Skinner box they use in psych&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:36.640 --> 02:40:42.241
significance in it somewhere but I don't have that&nbsp;
information. Many of the children were transported&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:53.920
on private CIA jets small small jets or just just&nbsp;
like le jets. Yeah. And um transported there. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:57.680
so what's the program? What specifically is the&nbsp;
purpose of it? There's a lot of effort being put&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:03.520
into this then. Why? Um, project IBIS is again&nbsp;
the Nazi connection. The name comes from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:03.520 --> 02:41:10.480
um the Giza Intelligence Group underneath the Giza&nbsp;
Pyramids. The Nazi group in World War II. What&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:10.479 --> 02:41:16.799
Nazi group is this? Um, it's known as the Giza&nbsp;
Intelligence. The Nazi group. Which part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:22.800
Giza Plateau were they involved in? I don't know.&nbsp;
I just know they were um based underneath the Giza&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:22.800 --> 02:41:30.720
pyramids. It was a facility, the Nazis in World&nbsp;
War II. And um the name connects to Thoth, the um&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:41.120
the immortal, the Egyptian. Is um some connection&nbsp;
with an ibis bird would represent Thoth in Egypt.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:46.399
What are they were they trying to find in Egypt&nbsp;
or what did they find in Egypt? I think they&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:46.399 --> 02:41:52.240
found some kind of life extension technology and&nbsp;
this was effectively that this was a major part of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:57.599
the IBIS program was life extension regeneration.&nbsp;
Is there is there some kind of chamber that you&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:03.840
could mention or any any particular area? Yeah,&nbsp;
there's the emerald chambers. The emerald the or&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:03.840 --> 02:42:13.200
the emerald rooms, but I think that is that's in&nbsp;
more than one location. Um I'd rather not talk&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:22.240
too much about the emerald rooms. I'd rather just&nbsp;
focus um because it's such a complex subject. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:22.240 --> 02:42:27.359
um is this to do with the storage of souls on&nbsp;
the earth and the recreation on earth? This is&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:27.359 --> 02:42:39.040
very much physical um this is they at the um Q552&nbsp;
we were being indoctrinated with Nazi principles&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:46.640
um Germanic principles um were you indoctrinated&nbsp;
by Nazis? Yeah, it was Nazi. It wasn't just Nazis&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:52.400
there, but there was a big Nazi presence. Um, some&nbsp;
of the philosophies were indoctrinated with there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:52.399 --> 02:42:58.160
Um, you see those philosophies in um, Germanic&nbsp;
organizations to this day like the Odinist&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:04.720
Fellowship in this country. Um, the philosophies&nbsp;
are based around obviously the creation of an&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:14.080
Uber man, a Superman. But, um, they see life on&nbsp;
Earth as a means to an end. They're not trying&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:19.519
to get somewhere else. They're not trying to get&nbsp;
to heaven or another planet. They want to become&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:19.520 --> 02:43:28.320
physically immortal in this body on this earth&nbsp;
and stay here. Now um we're also indoctrinated&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:28.319 --> 02:43:36.080
with the the Germanic belief in um endless&nbsp;
warfare. Um is that would be our reality once&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:44.720
we stayed here physically. We um our reality would&nbsp;
be endless warfare and there'd be periods of rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:44.720 --> 02:43:50.960
You need to maybe reorganize the the logistics&nbsp;
or um they talked about the thousand-year Reich,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:50.960 --> 02:43:59.520
a thousand years of peace. Um which would be&nbsp;
periods of rest in between the warfare and then it&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:43:59.520 --> 02:44:06.960
would just be a continuous cycle. And um that was&nbsp;
effectively um how they had indoctrinated us to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:12.960
be assassins when we were older so we could keep&nbsp;
functioning. If we were concerned about the next&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:20.480
um hit and had anxiety about that we wouldn't&nbsp;
be able to carry out and function. But if in our&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:20.479 --> 02:44:26.879
mindset, if we believe that we were designed&nbsp;
for endless warfare and it would never stop,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:35.600
um we would just accept that and be able and be&nbsp;
relaxed when we were involved in assassination.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:44.480
And what kind of assassination or what kind of&nbsp;
missions are we are we talking about here? Um

02:44:44.479 --> 02:44:56.559
this is in numerous countries. um many different&nbsp;
ways. So it's it's um is it I mean we are we sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:44:56.560 --> 02:45:01.360
of going and doing a one two three bump somebody&nbsp;
off or or just just that different types of of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:01.359 --> 02:45:10.399
assassination. Um a lot of it was standard um&nbsp;
gunplay. Um I mean that that came later on down&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:10.399 --> 02:45:16.960
the road. Obviously we were actually raised&nbsp;
in this facility as babies. So from 1976 to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:16.960 --> 02:45:24.560
1979 we were raised in this base. Um the where&nbsp;
it was in the mountains um it was underground&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:30.720
but there was um it was above ground the main&nbsp;
entrance. It was like an aircraft hanger and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:34.960
um what kind of general area are we talking&nbsp;
about? What can you describe any? It's in&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:41.040
the mountains. It's um it's a very private&nbsp;
location near Nelson. Just near Nelson in&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:41.040 --> 02:45:48.800
the mountains. Would there be a mountain&nbsp;
name you could name? It's near I think it

02:45:48.800 --> 02:45:54.960
I'm not sure the mountain name. I know that&nbsp;
there's a um a logging compound nearby and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:45:54.960 --> 02:46:01.439
there's an old um access route near the logging&nbsp;
compound that actually takes you to the base in&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:01.439 --> 02:46:12.879
the mountain and Nelson's a very small town. Um&nbsp;
again the above ground um section of it was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:12.880 --> 02:46:21.440
aircraft hanger and um when we were first brought&nbsp;
there as bait is is it a is it got a runway and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:21.439 --> 02:46:29.759
landing place or um it's fenced off high fences&nbsp;
and um it has yeah it has a runway in front of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:29.760 --> 02:46:36.960
the aircraft hanger if you come in but the um the&nbsp;
aircraft hanger sits or fenced around the runways&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:44.800
here and the aircraft hangers here. Yeah, it's&nbsp;
quite a big building. Um but as babies we were&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:44.800 --> 02:46:50.960
um we slept in the aircraft hanger often&nbsp;
because um it was essentially a trauma&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:57.200
center. So they wanted us to be exposed to the&nbsp;
cold and there was um sets of cops in there. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:05.920
this is high up maybe a couple of thousand feet&nbsp;
up high over the Rocky Mountain. Very high. Um

02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:16.560
it's near B National Park right where um so they&nbsp;
we were kind of being exposed to the elements&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:23.360
essentially. We slept there um in the aircraft&nbsp;
hang with the doors open and there was rows of&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:23.359 --> 02:47:29.839
cops and we were under 24-hour armed guard all&nbsp;
at all times. So we couldn't be rescued from&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:35.760
that facility because there were factions there&nbsp;
that would rescue us at the first opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:35.760 --> 02:47:43.600
The people that like the parents or or the&nbsp;
well special forces groups um people that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:55.440
guarded us were they wore um they wore black&nbsp;
uniforms. um some and they wore black masks,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:47:55.439 --> 02:48:05.120
but sometimes they wore the um ultramodern SS&nbsp;
uniform, which it's um it's kind of like your&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:05.120 --> 02:48:16.479
standard SAS Black Ops uniform. um black boots,&nbsp;
black trousers, black top, but the um it has chest&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:16.479 --> 02:48:28.319
plates and there's leather around the arms and it&nbsp;
has the um SS double rune on the double. Yeah. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:28.319 --> 02:48:34.479
the SS symbol and um so that's a modern uniform.&nbsp;
When you're saying a modern uniform, you're&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:34.479 --> 02:48:42.240
talking about post World War II. Yeah. This is the&nbsp;
the the modern SS uniform. So getting back to this&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:42.240 --> 02:48:49.120
SS uniform, I think what era are we talking about?&nbsp;
'7s. This was 1976 and we were first taken there&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:55.599
as babies. So that means that the that's the SS&nbsp;
wearing those uniforms in Canada. So they must&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:48:55.600 --> 02:49:04.080
have authority to do so. um there was some kind of&nbsp;
internal war going on in the military and in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:04.080 --> 02:49:11.359
intelligence community. So is this this is um are&nbsp;
you saying this is therefore a Nazi organization&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:11.359 --> 02:49:21.519
that's that's doing this? Um yeah. Yeah. So by by&nbsp;
inference it means that the connections with AL499&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:27.840
and the other places in the UK must be essentially&nbsp;
under Nazi control or is that NSA control? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:27.840 --> 02:49:34.319
this is it. You see, there's a big Nazi element&nbsp;
within the NSA because this was a officially an&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:34.319 --> 02:49:46.799
NSA facility, the Q552 at Nelson. This was a NSA&nbsp;
base officially the Q552 facility at Nelson. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:53.680
um, there's a there's a major Nazi element within&nbsp;
the NSA. So, that essentially is saying that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:49:53.680 --> 02:50:00.160
NSA is a Nazi organization and a survivor&nbsp;
organization from World War II. Um, yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:00.160 --> 02:50:09.040
I'd say that's a fairly accurate statement. So, de&nbsp;
facto World War II was won by the by the Nazis. I&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:17.040
wouldn't say they won, but I wouldn't say they&nbsp;
lost either. It survived. Survived. Yeah. In&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:17.040 --> 02:50:24.319
an underground fashion. If the NSA is essentially&nbsp;
protecting the Nazis or the Nazis are running the&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:24.319 --> 02:50:32.000
NSA. Yeah. Is is that what you're you're saying?&nbsp;
Um I'd say that the Nazis faction is running MI6.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:42.560
Um just to go off topic slightly before I carry&nbsp;
on about what happened at the AL um Q552. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:42.560 --> 02:50:53.440
my main contact in MI6, um, he's a director of&nbsp;
special operations, a man named Alfred Bonner. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:53.439 --> 02:50:57.359
is this your current contact or was your&nbsp;
contact? He's been my contact for years&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:50:57.359 --> 02:51:05.839
and he's my current contact. I've carried out&nbsp;
many assassinations under his instructions. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:05.840 --> 02:51:12.960
so you're saying this publicly? Is this um he's&nbsp;
not he's not publicly known but people can contact&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:20.560
MI6 and ask to speak to director Bonner you can&nbsp;
contact MI6 on the website the phone number and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:26.241
MI6 will admit they do have a director Bonner&nbsp;
there so what is the function of of telling&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:26.240 --> 02:51:31.200
us about this now is are they inviting people&nbsp;
to to ask those questions or do they want that&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:31.200 --> 02:51:36.399
information out they want this information out&nbsp;
they want this information out um Alfred Bonner&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:36.399 --> 02:51:47.679
he's from Bavaria. Um German effectively. He's um&nbsp;
he you see him very interesting looking man. Um&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:51:47.680 --> 02:52:01.840
you your classic Aryan giant. The guy's 6'6. Um&nbsp;
looks about 52 huge guy. Skinner box. A Skinner&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:01.840 --> 02:52:10.240
box is um famous psychiatrist Skinner. I forget&nbsp;
his first name. Um he would he designed this box&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:10.240 --> 02:52:16.160
and he they put babies in it and they put animals&nbsp;
in with the babies and they were doing cognitive&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:27.359
behavior test. See, now the babies would react to&nbsp;
the animals and um they would in this partic this&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:27.359 --> 02:52:36.719
this particular device um they put us in there and&nbsp;
they set up screens in the corners of the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:36.720 --> 02:52:46.960
uh people's the people's faces would be put on&nbsp;
the screens um enlarged and uh the faces would&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:54.319
call us and get our attention. We'd look and the&nbsp;
faces would start talking to us people and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:52:54.319 --> 02:53:05.359
uh the faces would look like they were um changing&nbsp;
into uh half human, half whatever the animal&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:05.359 --> 02:53:11.679
was. So if it was a snake, if they were putting&nbsp;
snakes in the pen, this the person talking would&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:20.720
um start talking to us and then his face would&nbsp;
change into half human, half snake lizard and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:20.720 --> 02:53:32.160
um they George Bush senior was the main um handler&nbsp;
of that particular Phil facility and um his face&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:32.160 --> 02:53:38.000
would often come on the screen and talk to us and&nbsp;
he would do the very much the rep the reptile with&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:43.359
the snakes. That would be his area. Was that&nbsp;
something that was done on a recorded type&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:43.359 --> 02:53:48.880
of a level or was it he did it personally? He was&nbsp;
on the screen. I'm not sure if he was that he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:48.880 --> 02:53:54.240
there sometimes physically but I mean the guy&nbsp;
travels all around the world to all different&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:54.240 --> 02:53:59.679
bases. He's a major programmer so I don't know he&nbsp;
could have been over the other side of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:53:59.680 --> 02:54:06.400
Um and he would come on and um Did this something&nbsp;
you experienced directly? This Yeah, I I saw him.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:06.399 --> 02:54:11.120
He used to talk to us, talk to me. And um And what&nbsp;
age were you when this happened? I was this was&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:11.120 --> 02:54:18.640
76. I was a baby. Yeah. And this, you know, this&nbsp;
carried on. I spent from 76 to 79 there and grew&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:18.640 --> 02:54:28.241
up there. Um the uh Queen Mother as well, she was&nbsp;
a programmer there. She would um her face would&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:28.240 --> 02:54:35.439
be flashed on the screen, but her specialtity was&nbsp;
wolves. Whenever they put the walls in with us,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:35.439 --> 02:54:45.120
um she would come on and she'd talk to us and&nbsp;
um she would start to change into halfwoman,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:53.760
half wolf like face on the screen. Was this done&nbsp;
by some kind of electronic video effect or I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:54:53.760 --> 02:55:02.800
know. I don't know. Um, can you name any other&nbsp;
animals associated with different other people?&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:02.800 --> 02:55:09.680
Um, the only ones I remember is um George&nbsp;
Brcina with snakes and the queen mother with&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:19.520
um wolves. It's the place was very dark. I'm still&nbsp;
starting to It's difficult to remember everything&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:28.640
that happened there. Still coming back in bits and&nbsp;
pieces. Um, I remember being put in the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:38.320
um toy the group of babies and um there were toys&nbsp;
put in and um one of the babies um took a toy off&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:38.319 --> 02:55:46.399
another baby and the um the little baby turned&nbsp;
around and hissed at the other child like a snake&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:46.399 --> 02:55:54.479
and his face sort of went like a snake. So we this&nbsp;
was absorbed into them psychologically or Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:55:54.479 --> 02:56:06.560
into their psyche. Yeah. And with the DNA anyway&nbsp;
that an anarchy DNA that the NSA were looking for.

02:56:06.560 --> 02:56:16.960
[Music] In part one, we heard how Michael&nbsp;
Prince is the birth name for James Casbolt&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:22.800
and how he was taken to a base in Canada near&nbsp;
the small mountain town of Nelson in British&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:22.800 --> 02:56:30.160
Columbia for cyborg enhancement as mind control&nbsp;
children selected by their specific blood types&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:30.160 --> 02:56:35.680
on how they were exposed to the open cold&nbsp;
night in a large aircraft style hanger to&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:42.560
sort out the men from the boys just as in ancient&nbsp;
Sparta then guarded by Nazi SS troops. in modern&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:48.720
type uniforms in the late 1970s. Michael sent this&nbsp;
scan of one of his security clearances. However,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:53.520
in earlier images he sent claiming to be at&nbsp;
the Dulce base, this could be anywhere. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:56:53.520 --> 02:57:02.720
if anyone really knows what these forms refer&nbsp;
to, please contact me at blue yonder.co.uk.

02:57:02.720 --> 02:57:07.440
What age were you when this happened? I was&nbsp;
a this was 76. I was a baby. Yeah. And this,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:07.439 --> 02:57:18.479
you know, this carried on. I spent 76 to 79 there.&nbsp;
and grew up there. Um the uh queen mother as well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:18.479 --> 02:57:23.120
she was a programmer there. She would um&nbsp;
her face would be flashed on the screen,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:29.279
but her specialtity was wolves.&nbsp;
Whenever they put the walls in with us,&nbsp;&nbsp;

02:57:29.279 --> 02:57:37.279
um, she would come on and she'd talk&nbsp;
to us and, um, she would start to
