Kind: captions Language: en KN and we're continuing on with a series of&nbsp; mind control in Canada. We've heard over the&nbsp;&nbsp; last 3 weeks a lecture by Dr. Colin Ross about&nbsp; the history of the CIA and military mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; experimentation programs uh documented history.&nbsp; Today we're going to start a an interview part&nbsp;&nbsp; one of a two-part interview with Dr. Colin&nbsp; Ross as we go into a bit more detail and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh explore the other many issues around this&nbsp; situation. You're listening to CKLN 88.1. I'm speaking with Dr. Colin Ross, a psychiatrist&nbsp; and researcher practicing in Dallas, Texas. And&nbsp;&nbsp; uh uh Dr. Ross, I wonder if you could just&nbsp; uh briefly describe who you are and what your&nbsp;&nbsp; current work is. Sure. I'm a Canadian by birth and&nbsp; training. I went to medical school in Edmonton and&nbsp;&nbsp; did my psychiatry training in Winnipeg. I moved&nbsp; down here to Dallas just a little over 5 years&nbsp;&nbsp; ago. I'm a specialist in multiple personality&nbsp; disorder and I've written a number of different&nbsp;&nbsp; books and lots of research papers and so on on&nbsp; that. Right now I'm working at a hospital in the&nbsp;&nbsp; Dallas area here. We have a program that we run&nbsp; on contract for the hospital which treats mostly&nbsp;&nbsp; people with multiple personality disorder. also&nbsp; uh other related disorders. Most of the people&nbsp;&nbsp; that we treat describe very traumatic and abusive&nbsp; childhoods. Now um what is a dissociative identity&nbsp;&nbsp; disorder and is it the same thing as multiple&nbsp; personality disorder? Dissociative identity&nbsp;&nbsp; disorder is the official new name for multiple&nbsp; personality disorder hasn't really caught on&nbsp;&nbsp; in the general language. It's a professional&nbsp; technical term. In 1994, that new diagnosis was&nbsp;&nbsp; introduced. It just replaces multiple personality&nbsp; disorder and the criteria for diagnosing it&nbsp;&nbsp; have been changed a little bit basically by&nbsp; adding a requirement for some type of amnesia,&nbsp;&nbsp; but basically it means the same thing as multiple&nbsp; personality. So, what does it mean when somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; has this disorder? What Well, the basic criteria&nbsp; for diagnosing are pretty straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have these different personality states or&nbsp; identities that take turns being in control of the&nbsp;&nbsp; body and there's some sort of amnesia or memory&nbsp; barrier between the different personality states.&nbsp;&nbsp; The several important points to understand about&nbsp; this disorder are first of all it's not literally&nbsp;&nbsp; true that they have different personalities.&nbsp; They just have these fragmented components of&nbsp;&nbsp; one personality and those have been referred to&nbsp; as different personalities for over 100 years but&nbsp;&nbsp; they're not literally different personalities.&nbsp; There isn't really more than one person there.&nbsp;&nbsp; And there's several different ways you can end&nbsp; up having multiple personality. One way, which is&nbsp;&nbsp; what we think we see most of the time clinically,&nbsp; is where you've basically been physically,&nbsp;&nbsp; sexually, emotionally abused or neglected as a&nbsp; child, and you create these different identities&nbsp;&nbsp; to cope with it and hold different memories and&nbsp; feelings about it and so on. And that can be,&nbsp;&nbsp; as I said, a combination of various types&nbsp; of trauma in childhood. It has to be fairly&nbsp;&nbsp; serious trauma usually. Then another way that&nbsp; you can get multiple personality is um where&nbsp;&nbsp; it's created either by mistake or deliberately by&nbsp; somebody else. And that could be in a bad therapy&nbsp;&nbsp; which is all out of control and not being handled&nbsp; properly. And then the other major way of arriving&nbsp;&nbsp; at multiple personality disorder is people&nbsp; who have what's called a factitious disorder.&nbsp;&nbsp; That means that they deliberately fake having&nbsp; it either to get into the patient role or get&nbsp;&nbsp; attention or get out of something or for some&nbsp; specific purpose. Now, have you seen this disorder&nbsp;&nbsp; occur um due to trauma as an adult or does it&nbsp; specifically happen while while a child? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's some cases reported in the literature and&nbsp; there's the odd case where it's trauma that starts&nbsp;&nbsp; in adulthood, but vast majority of time it seems&nbsp; to be childhood. Right. We've uh listened to your&nbsp;&nbsp; lecture um talking about the history of uh US mind&nbsp; control. You refer to the term yatrogenic. What&nbsp;&nbsp; does that mean? Yatrogenic is just a Greek word&nbsp; that means created by the doctor. So yatrogenic&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple personality is multiple personality&nbsp; that's created by mistake by a bad therapist&nbsp;&nbsp; who's using improper techniques. Okay. How did you&nbsp; get involved in working with people suffering from&nbsp;&nbsp; DID? Well, I actually diagnosed my first case&nbsp; when I was a medical student in Edmonton and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh just instantly found it really fascinating&nbsp; and interesting. And then when I was doing my&nbsp;&nbsp; four years of psychiatry training in Winnipeg,&nbsp; I saw one more case and I thought it was going&nbsp;&nbsp; to be too rare to really specialize in. But then&nbsp; in ' 85 when I finished my psychiatry training,&nbsp;&nbsp; I diagnosed another case and then I got some&nbsp; referrals and then more referrals and then I&nbsp;&nbsp; got a reputation for it and ended up getting lots&nbsp; of referrals from all kinds of different people in&nbsp;&nbsp; Western Canada and gradually sort of switched over&nbsp; to that being my specialty. And this this was when&nbsp;&nbsp; you were operating a practice in is it Winnipeg or&nbsp; Edmonton at the time? Yeah, Winnipeg. Right. I was&nbsp;&nbsp; a full-time uh university professor of psychiatry&nbsp; at one of the hospitals there. And and what did&nbsp;&nbsp; you find from what were your findings from working&nbsp; with people with DID or MPD? Well, I've published&nbsp;&nbsp; just on multiple personality and related things.&nbsp; I've published probably about 60 or so papers in&nbsp;&nbsp; the professional literature. So, I've found quite&nbsp; a few different things, but the main theme is&nbsp;&nbsp; really goes through the whole multiple personality&nbsp; literature. And that is that people who have this&nbsp;&nbsp; diagnosis clinically uh have lots of other things&nbsp; going on at the same time. lots of depression,&nbsp;&nbsp; lots of anxiety, drug and alcohol problems,&nbsp; eating disorder problems, sleep problems. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; they don't just have multiple personality,&nbsp; they got all kinds of different symptoms. They&nbsp;&nbsp; also tend to be in the health care system for&nbsp; quite a long period of time. Not all the time,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the majority of cases are in the health care&nbsp; system getting psychiatric treatment for one thing&nbsp;&nbsp; or another for quite a while. On average about&nbsp; uh 7 years before the multiple personality is&nbsp;&nbsp; diagnosed. And the other theme that we see going&nbsp; all the time is this childhood trauma that arises&nbsp;&nbsp; as a way of coping with childhood trauma. And then&nbsp; we just uh actually just found out this week that&nbsp;&nbsp; a paper has been accepted at the American&nbsp; Journal of Psychiatry where we assessed 103&nbsp;&nbsp; people with this diagnosis here in Dallas about&nbsp; uh almost exactly four years ago now. We gave&nbsp;&nbsp; them a whole bunch of different questionnaires&nbsp; and standardized tests and interviews and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then we followed up as many as we could two&nbsp; years later. And we were able to follow up 54 of&nbsp;&nbsp; them. And the uh reduction in all these different&nbsp; symptoms was really impressive. And 12 already in&nbsp;&nbsp; the first two years of follow-up, 12 of the 54&nbsp; people were all integrated back into one person.&nbsp;&nbsp; So they had a really dramatic and meaningful&nbsp; reduction in not just the amount of multiple&nbsp;&nbsp; personality related symptoms, but depression,&nbsp; anxiety, substance abuse, all kinds of things.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is the first uh scientifically designed&nbsp; kind of treatment outcome study that really&nbsp;&nbsp; shows that good treatment can be very helpful. So&nbsp; these people that you're talking about did undergo&nbsp;&nbsp; treatment with you or other other therapists came&nbsp; they came to our hospital usually for an average&nbsp;&nbsp; of about 17 days or so. Mhm. Uh 70% of our people&nbsp; are from outside Texas. So they're from all over&nbsp;&nbsp; the United States and we've had probably about&nbsp; 15 admissions of people from Ontario and they&nbsp;&nbsp; were then go home and are followed up by their&nbsp; therapists. So they only get about usually two,&nbsp;&nbsp; three, sometimes four weeks with us and they may&nbsp; go into our day hospital program for a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp; as well, but basically they're followed up by&nbsp; therapists all over the country. And are these&nbsp;&nbsp; therapists in contact with you in terms of um&nbsp; methods of therapy? Yeah, they've usually read&nbsp;&nbsp; my books and been to some of my workshops and&nbsp; are aware of my approach, but they don't have&nbsp;&nbsp; to necessarily follow my approach. Right. And&nbsp; these other symptoms that you were talking about,&nbsp;&nbsp; do you feel that they were also a result of&nbsp; childhood trauma? Yeah, the whole package seems&nbsp;&nbsp; to be related to childhood trauma. Uh now we got a&nbsp; lot of controversy about this going on in society&nbsp;&nbsp; in the psych psychology, psychiatry, sociology&nbsp; and so on, right? And we need a lot more research,&nbsp;&nbsp; but that's the best understanding I have right&nbsp; now. And there's fair bit of research data that&nbsp;&nbsp; backs that up. It's not totally nailed down&nbsp; scientifically. Mhm. Um, I'm wondering from&nbsp;&nbsp; your experience working in in Canada, how has the&nbsp; Canadian medical system responded to your your&nbsp;&nbsp; findings in in MPD research? Well, roughly about&nbsp; the same as American. Overall, there's a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; skepticism, a lot of political agitation, fair bit&nbsp; of negative hostile propaganda and backstabbing&nbsp;&nbsp; about it. And u, and then there's also quite a&nbsp; lot of support. And obviously if I've gotten 50&nbsp;&nbsp; or 60 professional papers published, I'm getting a&nbsp; reasonable reception. The main difference between&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada and the United States was in Canada, I just&nbsp; couldn't get the financial or clinical support to&nbsp;&nbsp; set up and run a program. And the reason that's&nbsp; possible down here is because there's a private&nbsp;&nbsp; for-profit sector in the mental health system&nbsp; that's profit driven. That's a business. and&nbsp;&nbsp; the the hospital corporation I contract with&nbsp; is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and so&nbsp;&nbsp; on. And since I attract patients, then there's a&nbsp; financial motive for the hospital to be interested&nbsp;&nbsp; in me providing that service. So that financial&nbsp; motive allows the system to sort of set aside all&nbsp;&nbsp; of these ideological and political debates that&nbsp; go on and so therefore I'm able to run a program.&nbsp;&nbsp; So for the uh survivors of childhood abuse that&nbsp; you're dealing with, I I guess they would have to&nbsp;&nbsp; have access to some kind of um funds to be able&nbsp; to undergo therapy. What what what is your sense&nbsp;&nbsp; of of uh people um that have undergone this in&nbsp; childhood that do not have access to to therapy?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the uh breakdown in terms of insurance&nbsp; coverage that we have in our program is roughly&nbsp;&nbsp; about 50% are on Medicare, which is a government&nbsp; disability program. So, they're sort of like&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian healthcare system people in that their&nbsp; health insurance is basically paid for by the&nbsp;&nbsp; government. And they also get disability welfare&nbsp; type payments for their basic support and living.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, half of our people are really insured in a way&nbsp; fairly similar to Canada. Then the other half have&nbsp;&nbsp; some sort of private insurance through their&nbsp; employers or their spouse's employers. The if&nbsp;&nbsp; you're in the one-third of people in the United&nbsp; States who don't have proper medical insurance,&nbsp;&nbsp; then you can't get proper medical care, including&nbsp; psychiatric and including the kind we provide. So&nbsp;&nbsp; that would seem to be uh probably a reason to&nbsp; think that the Canadian health care system is&nbsp;&nbsp; superior to the US. The funny thing is that if you&nbsp; have multiple personality or a related disorder,&nbsp;&nbsp; your odds of getting treatment are actually&nbsp; better in the United States because there's&nbsp;&nbsp; more programs and more therapists available. In&nbsp; Canada, even though you have universal access&nbsp;&nbsp; and universal coverage and actual practical&nbsp; reality, you can't get the treatment. So, you&nbsp;&nbsp; got theoretical universal coverage for multiple&nbsp; personality and trauma related disorders, but you&nbsp;&nbsp; don't have real practical coverage in reality.&nbsp; Well, the sort of paradox is that in the United&nbsp;&nbsp; States actually a higher percentage of people who&nbsp; could benefit from psychotherapy for all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp; problems arising from their childhoods um who&nbsp; can actually get therapy is higher in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting. Um now in your previous lecture you&nbsp; did uh go into a lot of um uh detail outlining the&nbsp;&nbsp; history of mind control. What is the link between&nbsp; MPD and mind control experimentation? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; how I got into this is a sort of a backdoor&nbsp; route. I I didn't really have any interest in&nbsp;&nbsp; the CIA or the military or mind control research&nbsp; or all of that. Particularly when I left Canada,&nbsp;&nbsp; hadn't read about it. Hadn't really heard&nbsp; any other doctors talking about it. Hadn't&nbsp;&nbsp; heard any patients talking about it. And pretty&nbsp; soon after I arrived in Texas in early 1992,&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple personality patients started talking&nbsp; about kind of real strange experiences I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; know what to make of that involved either going&nbsp; into hospitals, some sort of research setting&nbsp;&nbsp; somewhere on a military base and having different&nbsp; kinds of experiments done on them which involved&nbsp;&nbsp; um EEG machines or some kind of scientific&nbsp; equipment and sensory deprivation,&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe physical spinning, maybe hallucinogens,&nbsp; and it wasn't any kind of uh cult and obviously&nbsp;&nbsp; wasn't just their parents or something going&nbsp; on in their family. And initially I thought&nbsp;&nbsp; that was really too much to believe. But then I&nbsp; decided I should at least look into it a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit. So I started basically in early '92 doing a&nbsp; little bit of reading. And the more reading I did,&nbsp;&nbsp; what amazed me was that instead of coming to the&nbsp; conclusion, oh well, this is not possible. There's&nbsp;&nbsp; no documentation of this kind of stuff. Actually,&nbsp; the more I read, the more documentation I got that&nbsp;&nbsp; all kinds of absolutely unbelievable and bizarre&nbsp; and unethical and harmful mind control research&nbsp;&nbsp; has been done in Canada and the United States&nbsp; since the Second World War. And I've actually&nbsp;&nbsp; um interviewed and spoken with a number of people&nbsp; who have documented mind control research. Most of&nbsp;&nbsp; the patients that we work with who we hear these&nbsp; kind of things from, we get zero documentation&nbsp;&nbsp; that it's actually real. So I kind of disconnected&nbsp; my my research or my study about this from the&nbsp;&nbsp; stories I was hearing from the patients and did it&nbsp; as a separate research project. And what I've done&nbsp;&nbsp; then over the last 5 years is uh talked to lots&nbsp; of other people in the field who are interested in&nbsp;&nbsp; this. Read pretty well everything that's written&nbsp; on it. And through the Freedom of Information Act,&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got somewhere in probably in the ballpark&nbsp; of six or 7,000 pages of documents from the CIA&nbsp;&nbsp; which I've reviewed. And then I've gone to the uh&nbsp; medical school library and I've sent my secretary&nbsp;&nbsp; to five or six different places in the United&nbsp; States to go into archives in special collections&nbsp;&nbsp; and library resources and so on. So I've ended&nbsp; up now with probably more than almost two full&nbsp;&nbsp; four drawer filing cabinets full of documentation&nbsp; on all kinds of things. how I got into this and&nbsp;&nbsp; the connection with multiple personality for me&nbsp; personally was just that my multiple personality&nbsp;&nbsp; patients were the ones who started telling these&nbsp; kind of stories and got me interested in it. Right&nbsp;&nbsp; now from from a therapist point of view, how&nbsp; how do you tell if somebody is giving you an&nbsp;&nbsp; account of actual abuse or whether they're just&nbsp; fabricating something? Well, basically all the&nbsp;&nbsp; professional associations including the Canadian&nbsp; Psychiatric Association that have made statements&nbsp;&nbsp; on this and all the scientific research completely&nbsp; supports the conclusion that you can't tell. And&nbsp;&nbsp; that goes both ways. You cannot tell. You can't&nbsp; tell for sure just by listening to the patient's&nbsp;&nbsp; story. You can't tell that it's true. Also, you&nbsp; can't tell for sure that it's false. In other&nbsp;&nbsp; words, you can't tell one way or the other without&nbsp; some sort of outside proof. that is proof that&nbsp;&nbsp; it really happened or proof that it really didn't&nbsp; happen. And what I've learned in the especially in&nbsp;&nbsp; the last five years is there's really no limit to&nbsp; how detailed, how compelling, how full of feeling,&nbsp;&nbsp; how detailed a bunch of memories can be and&nbsp; be either totally real or never have happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; M I've worked with people who had really really&nbsp; really elaborate memories of all kinds of things&nbsp;&nbsp; with tremendous amount of detail and then we've&nbsp; been able to prove it never happened. Right. So&nbsp;&nbsp; that uh can't tell and that's why I decided to&nbsp; do this research kind of separated off from what&nbsp;&nbsp; the patients were telling me. right now. What&nbsp; um what uh similarities have you come across&nbsp;&nbsp; in within the survivor accounts and what you've&nbsp; discovered in the CIA documentation about their&nbsp;&nbsp; mind control programs? Well, basically, if you&nbsp; take a a typical elaborate story that you'll hear&nbsp;&nbsp; from one of multiple personality patients who have&nbsp; these kind of memories and you break it down into&nbsp;&nbsp; the elements or components of the mind control&nbsp; techniques that they describe, I've been able to&nbsp;&nbsp; document just about every one with maybe one or&nbsp; two exceptions. And all of this was carried out&nbsp;&nbsp; in a series of programs that um really began in&nbsp; the Second World War with what was called the OSS,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor&nbsp; to the CIA. Yeah. It was set up immediately after&nbsp;&nbsp; Pearl Harbor when it became obvious that there&nbsp; was a huge problem with US military intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp; gathering because they were totally surprised&nbsp; by the Japanese. And so it was set up in about&nbsp;&nbsp; 1941. And then at the end of the war, the OSS was&nbsp; disbanded. And then two years later, the personnel&nbsp;&nbsp; were rolled over into the CIA, which was created&nbsp; in September 1947 through the National Security&nbsp;&nbsp; Act. Basically the same people who had been in&nbsp; the OSS. And the OSS did various kinds of drug&nbsp;&nbsp; research and mind control research uh including&nbsp; with hallucinogens and so on and marijuana and&nbsp;&nbsp; sodiuml and so on and different types of drugs.&nbsp; Also they did experiments with hypnosis. There's&nbsp;&nbsp; um then a little bit of a gap before the CIA&nbsp; started up a series of programs in 1951. There was&nbsp;&nbsp; two programs called Artichoke and Bluebird that&nbsp; ran until about 1953 and they were rolled over&nbsp;&nbsp; into MK Ultra which ran from 1953 to 1964. Then MK&nbsp; Ultra was rolled over into MK search which ran up&nbsp;&nbsp; till 1973 and then running concurrently with MK&nbsp; Ultra and MK search. There's about roughly about&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 other programs that are declassified. There's a&nbsp; little smattering of information on each of those.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have names like MK Naomi and QK Hilltop&nbsp; and MK Delta. The the by far the best known and&nbsp;&nbsp; the one that I have the most documents on is MK&nbsp; Ultra. Mhm. It involved 149 different uh separate&nbsp;&nbsp; contracts at about 80 different institutions all&nbsp; around Canada and the United States. And in MK&nbsp;&nbsp; Naomi, MK Ultra and MK search, there's basically&nbsp; about three major blocks of types of mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; research. about uh half the projects in MK Ultra&nbsp; for instance were on some sort of procurement of&nbsp;&nbsp; chemicals, supplying chemicals or manufacturing&nbsp; chemicals which is mostly hallucinogens sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp; uh biological warfare weapons such as bacteria and&nbsp; viruses and sometimes other types of chemicals for&nbsp;&nbsp; mind control research. So it was just straight&nbsp; contracting to get the chemicals. An example of&nbsp;&nbsp; that would be in 1953, one of the MK Ultra sub&nbsp; projects, was a $400,000 grant to Eli Liy, which&nbsp;&nbsp; is the drug company that manufactures Prozac. Mhm.&nbsp; And that was for manufacturing LSD. So the the&nbsp;&nbsp; first major supplier of LSD in North America was&nbsp; actually Eli Lilly Drug Company. And and there's&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence that the CIA had uh was responsible for&nbsp; the distribution of this throughout the United&nbsp;&nbsp; States and North America. Yeah, they used it in&nbsp; actual experiments. Uh, and they also turned some&nbsp;&nbsp; of it over to the military through their MK Naomi&nbsp; program. A lot of the army mind control and drug&nbsp;&nbsp; research was done at Edgeware Arsenal, which&nbsp; has been in the news a lot recently because of&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of sexual assault and rape of female&nbsp; um, army personnel there. And it's in uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's linked to Fort Detric and Aberdine Proving&nbsp; Ground in Maryland, sort of north a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp; north of Washington DC. Is this the same military&nbsp; base that uh the BBC documentary was done about uh&nbsp;&nbsp; them giving um very powerful drugs to US soldiers?&nbsp; Yeah. Yeah. That it's was the major center for all&nbsp;&nbsp; kinds of hallucinogen and other drug research.&nbsp; Um the main one would that's best known as LSD,&nbsp;&nbsp; but actually the army released a list of about 130&nbsp; different compounds that it tested in mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; research that was released in 1975. So there's at&nbsp; least 130 different uh drugs and different types&nbsp;&nbsp; of compounds that they admit using on experimental&nbsp; subjects and they admit to um again in the mid70s&nbsp;&nbsp; they admitted to testing LSD on at least 1500&nbsp; subjects. So if you just do the arithmetic very&nbsp;&nbsp; roughly, if if they gave LSD to 1500 people and&nbsp; they tested 130 different drugs, that was just&nbsp;&nbsp; the army and you figure there's four branches of&nbsp; the military in the United States plus the CIA,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're talking about a huge number of people,&nbsp; potentially hundreds of thousands of people who&nbsp;&nbsp; got at least one dose of some experimental&nbsp; mind control drug, usually without any kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of adequate informed consent at all. Now, who&nbsp; typically would these people be? Where where are&nbsp;&nbsp; they drawing their their subjects from? Actually,&nbsp; I'd just like to pop back to um talking about Eli&nbsp;&nbsp; Liy for a second, just finish off that part of&nbsp; the story, and then I'll answer that question.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. Uh LSD was discovered accidentally in&nbsp; 1943 by a man named Albert Hoffman working at&nbsp;&nbsp; Sand Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland. Mhm. Which&nbsp; is a drug company. And uh what happened was that&nbsp;&nbsp; in the late 40s early 50s a rumor developed that&nbsp; the Russians might try to buy up the entire world&nbsp;&nbsp; supply of LSD. So that's why the CIA decided to&nbsp; contract with um the uh drug company in the United&nbsp;&nbsp; States that manufactures Prozac, which is Eli Liy,&nbsp; so they could have a secure North American supply.&nbsp;&nbsp; And one of the things that amazed me absolutely&nbsp; the most doing this background research was to&nbsp;&nbsp; find out who the original acid heads were in North&nbsp; America. Cuz you would assume it'd be beatnicks&nbsp;&nbsp; or criminals or musicians or somebody or other.&nbsp; Turns out that the original acid heads in North&nbsp;&nbsp; America were actually the psychiatrists&nbsp; and the CIA and military personnel. in in&nbsp;&nbsp; uh conferences that were financially sponsored by&nbsp; the CIA that resulted in books. I've got dozens of&nbsp;&nbsp; these psychiatrists who are some of the major drug&nbsp; researchers and major psychiatrists in the second&nbsp;&nbsp; half of the 20th century all describing the acid&nbsp; trips they were on, how much they enjoyed them,&nbsp;&nbsp; how useful they thought they were, and describing&nbsp; using LSD to treat all kinds of different things&nbsp;&nbsp; from alcoholism to anxiety to even homosexuality,&nbsp; which they considered to be a disease. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; they were themselves turning themselves and each&nbsp; other on. And then they were using all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp; different subjects. The majority would be either&nbsp; psychiatric patients who are already in treatment&nbsp;&nbsp; um army personnel, prisoners in several different&nbsp; prisons in the United States or in one project&nbsp;&nbsp; which was through MK Ultra. They actually had uh&nbsp; prostitutes that they hired through MK Ultra and&nbsp;&nbsp; they uh set up safe houses in San Francisco, New&nbsp; York. The prostitutes would go out on the street&nbsp;&nbsp; and recruit people for tricks. uh the CIA people&nbsp; would watch the tricks through one-way mirrors and&nbsp;&nbsp; monitor the sex and the prostitutes would slip&nbsp; the John's LSD and other hallucinogens and the&nbsp;&nbsp; these people were totally unaware that they were&nbsp; involved in any kind of government experiment&nbsp;&nbsp; totally unaware that they were going to get LSD&nbsp; at all. Gave no consent whatsoever. So most of the&nbsp;&nbsp; time the subjects were somebody who was one one&nbsp; notch down in the power setup. They were either an&nbsp;&nbsp; employee of the institution where the doctor was&nbsp; doing the research, they were a patient, they were&nbsp;&nbsp; um somebody in the military who loosely speaking&nbsp; volunteered but really didn't have much choice&nbsp;&nbsp; or they were prisoners. So usually was somebody&nbsp; who was under the control of the administration&nbsp;&nbsp; and under the control of the doctors somehow&nbsp; to some extent. Now, what uh specifically what&nbsp;&nbsp; prisons were involved in the uh the mind control&nbsp; experiments? Uh one of the prisons that was the&nbsp;&nbsp; New Jersey Reformatory at Bordontown, which is&nbsp; in Pennsylvania. The investigator there was Carl&nbsp;&nbsp; Feifer, who had a lot of uh MK Ultra and MK search&nbsp; money. He was also um besides being at the New&nbsp;&nbsp; Jersey neurosychiatric research institute which&nbsp; is where he did the work at Bordontown. He was the&nbsp;&nbsp; chairman of the department of pharmarmacology&nbsp; at one of the major universities in Atlanta,&nbsp;&nbsp; Emory University. And while he was there he&nbsp; did LSD experiments on people in the Atlanta&nbsp;&nbsp; uh penitentiary. Uh there was the um narcotics&nbsp; farm in Lexington, Kentucky, which was a prison&nbsp;&nbsp; that was uh mainly for drugrelated offenders.&nbsp; And then uh one of the more sinister ones is&nbsp;&nbsp; Vakavville State Prison in California. Mhm.&nbsp; Vakavville State Prison was an MK search site&nbsp;&nbsp; where they did um drug research related to the&nbsp; drug pemoline which is called Silert. The trade&nbsp;&nbsp; name is Silert. It's used for attention deficit&nbsp; disorder in kids. They were using it to study&nbsp;&nbsp; memory enhancement through drugs. And that was at&nbsp; the same time as Donald Dreeze was an inmate at&nbsp;&nbsp; Vakavville. Donald Defze was the head of the SLA&nbsp; liberation army that captured Patty Hurst. Uh at&nbsp;&nbsp; the same time that there was drug research going&nbsp; on at the New Jersey Reformatory at Bordontown,&nbsp;&nbsp; a man was then imprisoned there whose name was&nbsp; Louis Castillo and he was uh later arrested in&nbsp;&nbsp; the Philippines on suspicion of being there to&nbsp; assassinate Marcos for Nan Marcos and he exhibited&nbsp;&nbsp; uh five distinct personalities on um 40 different&nbsp; interviews conducted by the Philippines FBI.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was consultation from the Philippines FBI to&nbsp; the American FBI his case also because he alleged&nbsp;&nbsp; that he was involved in the Kennedy assassination.&nbsp; There was a consultation with uh Gerald Ford who&nbsp;&nbsp; was on the Warren Commission. So all of this&nbsp; is sort of tied into all kinds of aspects of&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole second half of the 20th century.&nbsp; This very very twisted convoluted history.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mhm. people who um were the expert witnesses&nbsp; for Patty Hurst uh who were saying that she&nbsp;&nbsp; had been captured by the Simines Liberation Army&nbsp; and brainwashed by them using the mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; techniques of destructive cults which are very&nbsp; similar to the mind control techniques of the&nbsp;&nbsp; CIA military mind control. The those witnesses&nbsp; included uh Robert Lifton, Margaret Singer,&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin, and a psychiatrist named Jolly West. and&nbsp; Jolly West and Martin Orin were had top secret&nbsp;&nbsp; clearance and had MK Ultra money. Their testimony&nbsp; about Patty Hurst was that a new identity named&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanya had been created through these brainwashing&nbsp; techniques and Patty Hurst identified herself as&nbsp;&nbsp; Tanya when she robbed a bank. She was convicted&nbsp; and found guilty and actually sentenced to jail&nbsp;&nbsp; for that. So the uh experts in a lot of the CIA&nbsp; mind control programming were very aware of the&nbsp;&nbsp; possibility of creating an artificial multiple&nbsp; personality through mind control techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp; And they testified that this had been done by this&nbsp; character Donald Defreeze who was a black criminal&nbsp;&nbsp; who was basically a petty criminal and thief. The&nbsp; there's several strange twists of that story. Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the strange twists which is somewhat&nbsp; documented but not completely documented is&nbsp;&nbsp; that Donald Def's according to several different&nbsp; sources and according to Patty Hurst uh biography&nbsp;&nbsp; as well was actually an employee of the CIA during&nbsp; the Vietnam War who's a psychological warfare oh&nbsp;&nbsp; sorry there's a not Donald Dere himself another&nbsp; man named Coloulston Westbrook was an employee of&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the CIA full-time and was a psychological&nbsp; warfare expert in Vietnam camp and according&nbsp;&nbsp; to these several different books, he came back&nbsp; uh and got a job at the University of Berkeley&nbsp;&nbsp; as a language instructor. And then he entered&nbsp; Vakavville prison under cover of the Black&nbsp;&nbsp; Cultural Association, which was a black prisoners&nbsp; and inmates program. And undercover of that black&nbsp;&nbsp; cultural association, he used mind control&nbsp; techniques on Donald Defreeze and actually&nbsp;&nbsp; gave him his code name of Sank and designed the&nbsp; seven-headed Cobra logo of the Symbian Liberation&nbsp;&nbsp; Army. Then Donald Dreeze was transferred&nbsp; from a maximum security facility at VAC,&nbsp;&nbsp; namely Vakavville to a low security facility from&nbsp; which he immediately escaped and several months&nbsp;&nbsp; after then captured Patty Hurst and used fairly&nbsp; sophisticated mind control techniques on her and&nbsp;&nbsp; created this Manurion candidate second identity&nbsp; bank robber and her named Tanya. So unless all of&nbsp;&nbsp; this is highly coincidental, um what you're saying&nbsp; is that the SLA was a CIA creation. That's I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know for a documented fact that that's true, but&nbsp; um that's what these several different books are&nbsp;&nbsp; alleging and the information is fairly detailed&nbsp; and I'm trying to research up on that. But it's&nbsp;&nbsp; absolutely known for a fact that um these do&nbsp; two doctors, Dr. West and Dr. Or had extensive&nbsp;&nbsp; uh funding from all branches of military and and&nbsp; he published off starting in 1943 and going all&nbsp;&nbsp; the way up to 1971 very very detailed accounts&nbsp; of creating multiple personality during the&nbsp;&nbsp; Second World War for uh various branches of the&nbsp; US military. And basically these people were he&nbsp;&nbsp; called them multiple personality. uh he talked&nbsp; about the multiple personality literature and he&nbsp;&nbsp; referred to them as super spies. So the the idea&nbsp; is that you create somebody artificially using&nbsp;&nbsp; hypnosis and other mind control techniques who&nbsp; had no multiple personality before but now has&nbsp;&nbsp; this second identity and the second identity&nbsp; is hidden behind a memory barrier or amnesia&nbsp;&nbsp; barrier and there's a verbal access code that's&nbsp; used to call out the second identity. And so now,&nbsp;&nbsp; say the person is a marine, they'll be given&nbsp; some kind of a courier assignment to take some&nbsp;&nbsp; documents say to Tokyo, but GHS then calls out the&nbsp; second personality and sticks in some classified&nbsp;&nbsp; information into the second personality. The then&nbsp; there's a switch back to the main identity. The&nbsp;&nbsp; person is just going on this routine trip to take&nbsp; some sort of documents or technical materials over&nbsp;&nbsp; to Tokyo. when it gets to the far end then uh he&nbsp; uses the example of a Colonel Brown. Colonel Brown&nbsp;&nbsp; in Tokyo then uses the code signal and the example&nbsp; that he gives and one of the description is that&nbsp;&nbsp; this Colonel Brown says the moon is clear. As&nbsp; soon as he says the moon is clear then the other&nbsp;&nbsp; identity pops out gives the classified message.&nbsp; Colonel Brown inserts a classified response. Then&nbsp;&nbsp; the person pops back to their regular identity,&nbsp; goes back home and thinks that they've just been&nbsp;&nbsp; on a routine assignment. But Esther Brooks again&nbsp; says the moon is clear. The identity comes out&nbsp;&nbsp; and Esther Brooks gets the classified message&nbsp; from this Colonel Brown. So he describes using&nbsp;&nbsp; these people in hypnotic uh courier u missions&nbsp; and for actual operations extensively many times&nbsp;&nbsp; during the second world war. So this is in George&nbsp; Eterbrook's own documentation that he's describing&nbsp;&nbsp; this right and he also describes using them for in&nbsp; infiltration operations. So the idea there is you&nbsp;&nbsp; take somebody who's a loyal patriotic marine and&nbsp; you create in them a new identity of a communist&nbsp;&nbsp; and you submerge the previous identity of the&nbsp; patriotic marine. Now this person who's a a really&nbsp;&nbsp; diehard communist goes and infiltrates various&nbsp; communist cells or political organizations or&nbsp;&nbsp; does whatever spy work is required. And the idea&nbsp; is if one of these couriers or these infiltration&nbsp;&nbsp; agents is captured and interrogated, they actually&nbsp; have no idea that they're spies. They genuinely&nbsp;&nbsp; think they're either on just a routine mission or&nbsp; they generally believe that they're communists. So&nbsp;&nbsp; then they can't be interrogated and they can't&nbsp; be uh made to reveal information so easily.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then what of course they go in and they&nbsp; do whatever infiltration operation is required&nbsp;&nbsp; and then they come back and they're debriefed by&nbsp; Esther Brooks who knows how to get through to the&nbsp;&nbsp; original personality and some of these people are&nbsp; actually g according to Esther Brooks were given&nbsp;&nbsp; dishonorable discharges as part of their cover.&nbsp; Now one question about that is is Etorbrooks&nbsp;&nbsp; just telling tall tales? Well, I've been able to&nbsp; build up a lot of documentation about him and his&nbsp;&nbsp; uh personal archives are still housed at this&nbsp; Colgate College. I photocopied probably what&nbsp;&nbsp; would be a pile of paper at least a foot deep. And&nbsp; what did that those documents reveal to you? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's all his personal papers, correspondence,&nbsp; background, and so I've got uh actual original&nbsp;&nbsp; documents photocopied now showing that he in&nbsp; fact was employed by the War Department during&nbsp;&nbsp; the Second World War. um he uh marketed his ideas&nbsp; to every branch of military intelligence in the&nbsp;&nbsp; United States. There's tons of correspondents&nbsp; with him from all kinds of navy, army, air force&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence people. Uh he did a lot of training&nbsp; at Fort Hullird and other locations. Um, and one&nbsp;&nbsp; of the most interesting things about him is that&nbsp; he corresponded pretty regularly with Jay Edgar&nbsp;&nbsp; Hoover from the 1930s through into the 1960s. He&nbsp; had a lot of correspondence with Jed Garoover.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a lot of FBI personnel who came out and&nbsp; visited him, attended his different teachings and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh a lot of these people talked about reading&nbsp; his textbook which came out in 1943 that's called&nbsp;&nbsp; hypnotism and in that textbook he describes&nbsp; these um artificial multiple personalities in&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of detail. I've got good documentation of&nbsp; the CIA in Bluebird and Artichoke did pretty much&nbsp;&nbsp; the same experiments. They describe several&nbsp; different things. They they don't describe&nbsp;&nbsp; actual operations, but they describe real life&nbsp; simulations where they're testing these people.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, they describe the same thing that Sbrooks is&nbsp; talking about where they uh hypnotize somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; and condition them and create a second identity&nbsp; that can stand up on to a lie detector test.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, they describe creating amnesia barriers&nbsp; and having people go on assignments where they&nbsp;&nbsp; go into another building and rifle through&nbsp; some materials and take some documents and&nbsp;&nbsp; bring them back and then have no memory of doing&nbsp; that whatsoever. And uh in MK Ultra there was a&nbsp;&nbsp; contractor named Alden Sears who did experiments&nbsp; at the University of Minnesota and the University&nbsp;&nbsp; of Denver which were very similar and there's&nbsp; a lot of documentation of him uh procuring CIA&nbsp;&nbsp; safe houses for some of his experiments coming and&nbsp; doing demonstrations of these kind of techniques&nbsp;&nbsp; for military and CIA personnel and uh creating&nbsp; hypnotic couriers and so on. So there's several&nbsp;&nbsp; sets of documents that back up that this was done&nbsp; at an experimental level by the CIA successfully,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I don't have documents about their use in&nbsp; operations. Now you mentioned that there were&nbsp;&nbsp; three areas of of interest in the mind control&nbsp; experimentation. Um wonder if we could just review&nbsp;&nbsp; those again. You you mentioned drugs. A big chunk&nbsp; was just uh manufacturing and supplying drugs,&nbsp;&nbsp; chemicals, and biological weapons. Another uh&nbsp; large chunk was actually using the drugs in&nbsp;&nbsp; experiments on people to try and create amnesia&nbsp; to create altered states of consciousness to test&nbsp;&nbsp; the drugs for interrogation purposes and also to&nbsp; test them for detecting hypnotically programmed&nbsp;&nbsp; agents. There was a team called the Artichoke team&nbsp; that was created as part of Project Artichoke that&nbsp;&nbsp; would use different chemical and mind control&nbsp; sensor deprivation techniques to try and figure&nbsp;&nbsp; out if somebody had been hypnotically programmed&nbsp; by another intelligence agency. In other words,&nbsp;&nbsp; they were trying to pick up these hypnotically&nbsp; controlled double agents that had been created&nbsp;&nbsp; either by the KGB or whoever. Then about a quarter&nbsp; of the research projects were just kind of odds&nbsp;&nbsp; and ends of all different types, different&nbsp; psychology and sociology experiments. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; a man named R. Gordon Wson who wrote a book&nbsp; called Soma, the divine mushroom of immortality,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is about that uh toad stool that you always&nbsp; see in fairy tales, which has got a white stock&nbsp;&nbsp; and a red cap with white flexcks on it. That's&nbsp; a mushroom ammonita mascara. It's a hallucinagen&nbsp;&nbsp; that was used by circumpolar shamans in both&nbsp; uh northern Canada, Alaska, and Siberia for&nbsp;&nbsp; centuries. So this R. Gordon Wson, who called this&nbsp; mushroom soma, divine mushroom of immortality,&nbsp;&nbsp; he had an MK Ultra grant through JP Morgan company&nbsp; to go on an expedition to northern Mexico to try&nbsp;&nbsp; and find hallucenic mushrooms. And just to give&nbsp; you an example of how all these things kind of tie&nbsp;&nbsp; into our culture at large, J. Chester Brooks gave&nbsp; uh three or four major symposia that he set up at&nbsp;&nbsp; Colgate College and he invited all kinds of people&nbsp; to them which included Martin Or um in one of the&nbsp;&nbsp; actually two of the different uh conferences&nbsp; or symposia that he put on Aldis Huxley came&nbsp;&nbsp; and talked and Aldis Huxley used hallucinogens&nbsp; himself and wrote the novel the brave new world&nbsp;&nbsp; in the brave new world which is a science fiction&nbsp; book, the government controls the people by giving&nbsp;&nbsp; them a mind control drug called soma. So all these&nbsp; things are kind of very strangely interconnected&nbsp;&nbsp; with each other. Not as part of a huge conspiracy,&nbsp; but just because all these people knew each other,&nbsp;&nbsp; talked to each other, influenced and affected each&nbsp; other. One of the um purposes of a lot of the sub&nbsp;&nbsp; projects, four of the MK Ultra sub projects were&nbsp; on children and three of those investigators knew&nbsp;&nbsp; that it was did not know it was CIA money and&nbsp; one did know it was CIA money. But the research&nbsp;&nbsp; projects themselves were pretty bland and not very&nbsp; alarming. So the purpose there as stated by the&nbsp;&nbsp; CIA is not really the research as such. One of&nbsp; them MKlra sub project 103 was at the children's&nbsp;&nbsp; international summer camp in Maine and it was a&nbsp; camp basically where children from all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp; different countries would come and spend uh weeks&nbsp; or a summer and the purpose of the research was to&nbsp;&nbsp; study how children communicate and solve problems&nbsp; when they don't share a common language but the&nbsp;&nbsp; purpose of the CIA funding which was secret was&nbsp; that they wanted to establish contact with a&nbsp;&nbsp; whole bunch of foreign international children who&nbsp; were as young as 11 years old because they might&nbsp;&nbsp; be of potential intelligence use in the future. In&nbsp; other words, they were just interested in getting&nbsp;&nbsp; an inn so they could make a list of people&nbsp; and start figuring out who might be an good&nbsp;&nbsp; person to recruit for whatever CIA purpose in the&nbsp; future. And they were doing this with really just&nbsp;&nbsp; children. Now you also you mentioned that um uh&nbsp; multiple personalities are much easily much more&nbsp;&nbsp; easily created um within children and if the&nbsp; um uh if the military and CIA's um goals were&nbsp;&nbsp; to use multiple personalities for intelligence&nbsp; purposes um is there evidence of experimentation&nbsp;&nbsp; on children? uh not experimentation to&nbsp; create multiple personality directly,&nbsp;&nbsp; but there's experiments on children that were&nbsp; you would think were totally un unbelievable,&nbsp;&nbsp; impossible, could never happen. And if if you&nbsp; heard somebody telling you about them, you just&nbsp;&nbsp; think the person was making it up or was diluted,&nbsp; but actually I have the publications that describe&nbsp;&nbsp; the research. One thing is that GH Esster Brooks&nbsp; himself did some kind of hypnosis experiments on&nbsp;&nbsp; children at two different orphanages in northern&nbsp; New York. So he did create multiple personality&nbsp;&nbsp; experimentally. He did correspond with Jed&nbsp; Garoover about using hypnosis and drugs&nbsp;&nbsp; on juvenile offenders and he did actually do&nbsp; some kind of research at these two orphanages,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I don't know the exact nature of the research&nbsp; except that it involved hypnosis in some form.&nbsp;&nbsp; But if if you think this is too much to believe,&nbsp; there's no way that the CIA, the military would&nbsp;&nbsp; do experiments to create multiple personality&nbsp; in children. That's just too off-the-wall and&nbsp;&nbsp; too bizarre. Uh it'd be helpful if you know what&nbsp; actually is documented and what actually was done.&nbsp;&nbsp; And one of the most revered psychiatrists who had&nbsp; her obituary in the American Journal of Psychiatry&nbsp;&nbsp; recently is a woman named Loretta Bender. She was&nbsp; a child psychiatrist and you could interview any&nbsp;&nbsp; child psychiatrist around the country and he would&nbsp; speak in glowing terms about her contribution to&nbsp;&nbsp; child psychiatry. In a publication uh that I have&nbsp; on file that I photocopied that you can just get&nbsp;&nbsp; at the medical school library. It's not hard&nbsp; to get. She describes giving LSD in uh dosages&nbsp;&nbsp; of 150 micrograms which is a big street level dose&nbsp; for a kid to children aged 5 to 10 for days, weeks&nbsp;&nbsp; and sometimes months in a row. She also described&nbsp; giving hallucinogenic doses of psilocybin which&nbsp;&nbsp; is the main compound in magic mushrooms to kids&nbsp; as young as 5 years of age. So this network of&nbsp;&nbsp; doctors whose drugs were supplied either by&nbsp; the CIA or the military or by drug companies&nbsp;&nbsp; funded by the CIA and the military gave massive&nbsp; doses of LSD and other hallucinogens to kids&nbsp;&nbsp; uh five 6 7 8 years old and they would keep them&nbsp; on uh full acid trips up to months in a row. And&nbsp;&nbsp; this was documented in the journals at the time.&nbsp; Yeah, it was published in the reg regular medical&nbsp;&nbsp; journals. You can just go to the library and&nbsp; photocopy. And there was no outcry in the in the&nbsp;&nbsp; profession against this. I mean, this sounds like&nbsp; torture. No, it was just regarded as psychiatrist&nbsp;&nbsp; doing research and trying to help kids. That's&nbsp; the thing that's most amazing about all of this&nbsp;&nbsp; is you don't have to have a conspiracy theory. Uh,&nbsp; and really conspiracy theories are interesting,&nbsp;&nbsp; but kind of beside the point. I think the thing&nbsp; that's most amazing is that all this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff is just straightforward everyday regular&nbsp; activity of psychiatrists and psychologists. It&nbsp;&nbsp; gets published. It gets presented at conferences&nbsp; and nobody comments on it or gets outraged about&nbsp;&nbsp; it or does anything about it. Incredible. Another&nbsp; thing, another type of research that's fully&nbsp;&nbsp; documented and again if you know the references,&nbsp; any medical school library has these references on&nbsp;&nbsp; file and you can go and photocopy them. There's&nbsp; a whole body of research on brain electrode&nbsp;&nbsp; implants. The main people who were doing that were&nbsp; um this Jolly West tried to set up a program in&nbsp;&nbsp; u Los Angeles to do that which was approved&nbsp; by Ronald Reagan but then got shut down by&nbsp;&nbsp; public protest. The main work was done at Tlane&nbsp; University in New Orleans by Robert Heath, at Yale&nbsp;&nbsp; by Joseé Delgato and at Harvard by a team that&nbsp; included Frank Irvin and William. So these are the&nbsp;&nbsp; the major universities in the western world. What&nbsp; they basically did was they would stick very fine&nbsp;&nbsp; electrodes into a human being's brain often up&nbsp; to 15 20 25 electrodes at one time and they would&nbsp;&nbsp; stick them in specific centers in the brain or&nbsp; specific areas in the brain. And then they would&nbsp;&nbsp; stimulate the electrodes electrically through&nbsp; wires and that would cause the electrode to&nbsp;&nbsp; discharge which would cause that part of the brain&nbsp; to fire. And then uh Joseé Delgado at Yale made a&nbsp;&nbsp; technical advance which was he invented a remote&nbsp; transmitter box that in the 1960s had a range of&nbsp;&nbsp; up to 100 ft. So he could push a button on the&nbsp; box that would transmit a signal to the electrode.&nbsp;&nbsp; There'd be a firing of the electrode and that part&nbsp; of the brain would then get activated. And in the&nbsp;&nbsp; u books and the papers that are published, he&nbsp; describes also doing this in cats and in monkeys.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he refers to these monkeys as mechanical toys&nbsp; because he could control their body movements and&nbsp;&nbsp; control their behavior. An example of what he did&nbsp; with monkeys was he had uh a group of monkeys who&nbsp;&nbsp; are all in the same species living in a large&nbsp; cage. And they have a dominance hierarchy. That&nbsp;&nbsp; is they have a boss monkey who runs the whole show&nbsp; and then they have a whole bunch of submissive&nbsp;&nbsp; males and females. And in the normal setup, the&nbsp; boss monkey has half the cage to himself and all&nbsp;&nbsp; the other monkeys get to use the other half. And&nbsp; if they try and come in his space, then he gets&nbsp;&nbsp; mad or gets angry or beats them up or threatens&nbsp; them or whatever. And this is just the sort of no&nbsp;&nbsp; normal social structure of these monkey troops.&nbsp; What he did then was he implanted an electrode&nbsp;&nbsp; in the brain of the boss monkey. And when he&nbsp; pushed a certain button on his transmitter box,&nbsp;&nbsp; the boss monkey became completely passive. And so&nbsp; the other monkeys started to figure this out and&nbsp;&nbsp; would start getting bold and would come into his&nbsp; part of the cage and would rough him up and not&nbsp;&nbsp; pay attention to him. And so the next step in the&nbsp; experiments was he put a lever in the actual cage&nbsp;&nbsp; that the different monkeys could get their hands&nbsp; on. They could press the lever. When they pressed&nbsp;&nbsp; the lever, it then transmitted a signal to the&nbsp; electrode in the boss monkeyy's brain, making him&nbsp;&nbsp; be passive. So the other monkeys learned this. So&nbsp; the other monkeys started practicing mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; on the boss monkey by pressing the lever to make&nbsp; him have these seizures in this part of the brain&nbsp;&nbsp; that made him passive. They actually learned&nbsp; how to control the boss monkey. And it shows&nbsp;&nbsp; a picture of the other monkeys all over the cage&nbsp; and not paying any attention to the boss monkey&nbsp;&nbsp; at all. What he did then was he did this in human&nbsp; beings, including children. And he describes an&nbsp;&nbsp; 11-year-old boy that he put brain electrodes in.&nbsp; And when he pressed the uh the right button on&nbsp;&nbsp; the box, the boy would start talking about&nbsp; maybe being a girl and would start talking&nbsp;&nbsp; about wanting to marry a male therapist. So they&nbsp; were using brain electrol implants to modify the&nbsp;&nbsp; identity and the worldview and the behavior of&nbsp; uh children as young as 11. Incredible. Robert&nbsp;&nbsp; Heath who who did the same sort of stuff at Tulain&nbsp; University. There's a he actually describes the&nbsp;&nbsp; same case in several different publications and&nbsp; the guy's referred to as subject B19 and he was&nbsp;&nbsp; uh I forget if he was 18 or 20. He was in around&nbsp; 1820 maybe 19 and he was a homosexual guy and they&nbsp;&nbsp; viewed homosexuality as a medical disease which&nbsp; needed to be treated. So they put brain electrodes&nbsp;&nbsp; in this guy, one of which went into the area of&nbsp; the brain called the septum, which was one of the&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure centers of the brain. And then they would&nbsp; push the button uh which would cause the electrode&nbsp;&nbsp; to fire. And he would not have excuse me, not have&nbsp; a full orgasm, but would be sort of 3/4 of the way&nbsp;&nbsp; to orgasm, feeling really really good as a result&nbsp; of the button being pushed. And they they kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of studied that and practiced it. And while they&nbsp; were pushing the box, they would get him to watch&nbsp;&nbsp; heterosexual pornography films so that he would&nbsp; be experiencing a near orgasm while he's watching&nbsp;&nbsp; heterosexual pornography. They were trying to&nbsp; switch him over to being interested in women. And&nbsp;&nbsp; then they did two further things. They set him&nbsp; up with a little box of his own where he could&nbsp;&nbsp; push the button on the box himself. And they have&nbsp; a chart of different three-hour periods and they&nbsp;&nbsp; show how many times he pushed the button himself.&nbsp; He in one three-hour period got up to pushing the&nbsp;&nbsp; button 1500 times to give himself an artificial&nbsp; near orgasm. And then the final step they did in&nbsp;&nbsp; the research was they brought in a 20-year-old&nbsp; prostitute. This is to the medical school and&nbsp;&nbsp; had her have sex with him. And while they were&nbsp; having sex, they recorded the brain electrode&nbsp;&nbsp; output because they it was a two-way communication&nbsp; system. they could send a signal to the guy's&nbsp;&nbsp; brain to fire off that part of the brain or they&nbsp; could just use the electrodes to monitor the brain&nbsp;&nbsp; activity that was going on naturally. So they&nbsp; actually took brain electrode activity recordings&nbsp;&nbsp; from deep inside his brain while he was having an&nbsp; orgasm with this female prostitute. And then they&nbsp;&nbsp; report that over an 11-month period of follow-up,&nbsp; he was mostly heterosexual with a few relapses.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is just the the stuff that really went on.&nbsp; A guy at uh Harvard who was part of the Harvard&nbsp;&nbsp; brain electrode team, his name was William. He&nbsp; was um testifying at the recent hearings and&nbsp;&nbsp; there was a committee set up by Bill Clinton&nbsp; to look into all the radiation experiments.&nbsp;&nbsp; The radiation experiments are all intertwined&nbsp; and overlap with all this mind control stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; And Williamu, who was part of the brain electrode&nbsp; team at Harvard, described injecting plutonium&nbsp;&nbsp; into people at Harvard as part of um atomic energy&nbsp; commission military and CIA radiation research.&nbsp;&nbsp; And he claimed that all of the subjects there gave&nbsp; informed consent. But one of the subjects who was&nbsp;&nbsp; named HP12, I think HP was initials for human&nbsp; product. So they referred to their experimental&nbsp;&nbsp; subjects as human product and then they would&nbsp; have a series of numbers. So this guy was HP12.&nbsp;&nbsp; He arrived at the emergency department at one of&nbsp; the Boston hospitals which was part of the Harvard&nbsp;&nbsp; system unconscious and unidentified. He was&nbsp; injected with plutonium obviously without giving&nbsp;&nbsp; informed consent. And he died uh without regaining&nbsp; consciousness and without being identified. So&nbsp;&nbsp; that didn't quite fit with the idea that everybody&nbsp; gave informed consent. Mhm. And uh recently the uh&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinton government uh approved a settlement of 4.8&nbsp; million for just 12 of these plutonium subjects.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's probably hundreds and hundreds and&nbsp; hundreds of them. And this was the outcome of the&nbsp;&nbsp; presidential hearing on radiation experiments. But&nbsp; what I think and what I'm going to start logging&nbsp;&nbsp; for is that there should be another hearing on&nbsp; the mind control side of things. Right. and uh&nbsp;&nbsp; the mind control experiments were introduced uh&nbsp; at the end of um the hearings. Um can you can you&nbsp;&nbsp; talk about that? What what evidence was introduced&nbsp; and what the response was by the US government?&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a number of different people. It was a&nbsp; typical uh kind of presidential commission which&nbsp;&nbsp; is like the various commissions of inquiry that&nbsp; go on in Canada where they receive all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp; mail and correspondents and then they go around&nbsp; the country having hearings that anybody can&nbsp;&nbsp; testify at and they had hearings in Washington&nbsp; that people went down to. So there's a number of&nbsp;&nbsp; people who testified about um two aspects of this.&nbsp; the documented stuff like I've been describing and&nbsp;&nbsp; then the memories of individual patients of&nbsp; stuff that they claim has gone on which isn't&nbsp;&nbsp; documented. So the the things that uh I know for&nbsp; sure went on and include that includes went on in&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada were use of hallucinogens uh implantation&nbsp; of these brain electrodes massive uses of electric&nbsp;&nbsp; shock and that's electric shock is an ECT&nbsp; treatment to make you have a seizure and also&nbsp;&nbsp; just electric shock to different parts of your&nbsp; body as part of behavior modification. um sensory&nbsp;&nbsp; deprivation experiments where people were kept in&nbsp; chambers for uh long periods of time until they&nbsp;&nbsp; started hallucinating. Um uh you Cameron who's&nbsp; the best known CIA contractor in Cameron did a&nbsp;&nbsp; what's called psychic driving where he would make&nbsp; people listen to tape loops for literally hours&nbsp;&nbsp; and hours and hours and hours and hours per day&nbsp; with repeated messages trying to modify their way&nbsp;&nbsp; of thinking. So all of these different elements&nbsp; have been used absolutely totally documented in&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff that's published in medical school library&nbsp; type journals. Mhm. One of my sort of favorite and&nbsp;&nbsp; most bizarre series of experiments like that was&nbsp; done at the University of Minnesota by a man named&nbsp;&nbsp; Amado Morazzi who had an Air Force grant for LSD&nbsp; research while at the University of Minnesota and&nbsp;&nbsp; previous to that he was the uh one of the sort&nbsp; of administrative managerial guys at Edgeware&nbsp;&nbsp; Arsenal for their mind control research. uh he&nbsp; besides just giving people LSD and so on he made&nbsp;&nbsp; use of what's called the Ames leaf room that's&nbsp; am a guy named Ames developed this room funded&nbsp;&nbsp; by the office of naval research which is heavily&nbsp; involved in all this mind control research themes&nbsp;&nbsp; leaf room is uh has different forms can either&nbsp; be a room that's usually built out of plywood&nbsp;&nbsp; that's got walls that are at all kinds of weird&nbsp; angles or this particular room was cubic So it's&nbsp;&nbsp; a just a normal shaped kind of cube and you would&nbsp; sit inside the room stuck one side would have no&nbsp;&nbsp; wall at all. It would be open and that's a side&nbsp; that you would be looking into and you would be&nbsp;&nbsp; sitting just inside the room so that you couldn't&nbsp; see anything except the walls and then the entire&nbsp;&nbsp; room was lined with leaves. So leaves were glued&nbsp; to all the walls. So there you are in this sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of environment where you can't exactly see where&nbsp; the corners are because of all these leaves. And&nbsp;&nbsp; then when you're in the Ames leaf room either in&nbsp; the research by Ames or this guy at University of&nbsp;&nbsp; Minnesota, you would put on special glasses called&nbsp; anchonic lenses. And the anoconic lenses would&nbsp;&nbsp; distort all of the angles. So like the ceiling&nbsp; would be sort of coming down at you. The floor&nbsp;&nbsp; would be slam sliding some other weird angle. One&nbsp; wall would be coming in at you and the other wall&nbsp;&nbsp; going away. The leaves on one side of the room&nbsp; would be all big and coming out at you and the&nbsp;&nbsp; leaves on the other side would be kind of flat and&nbsp; receding. And all of the different perspectives&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't fit together properly. And then the subject&nbsp; who's sitting in there looking through these&nbsp;&nbsp; lenses has a little control mechanism to control&nbsp; a bar that's at the far end of the room to try and&nbsp;&nbsp; set it to horizontal. And it shows a photograph of&nbsp; this guy sitting in there and the bar is like at a&nbsp;&nbsp; 40° angle, but he thinks it's horizontal. And then&nbsp; the extra twist that Morazzi did was while he had&nbsp;&nbsp; these people sitting in the Ames leaf room with&nbsp; these weird goggles on, he gave them LSD. That's&nbsp;&nbsp; all done on Air Force contracts. So this is pretty&nbsp; weird and bizarre stuff. Yeah. Um what uh what if&nbsp;&nbsp; any was the US government's response to the test&nbsp; specifically the mind control experimentation&nbsp;&nbsp; testimony at the um hearings on uh radiation?&nbsp; Uh they just kind of acknowledged it and really&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't comment or do much of anything with it. So&nbsp; nothing has been done to follow up. Not nothing&nbsp;&nbsp; systematic that I'm aware of. No. Right. I just&nbsp; want to go back to uh when you were talking about&nbsp;&nbsp; brain implants. Um, have you have you or other&nbsp; therapists come across direct evidence of implants&nbsp;&nbsp; in clients? Uh, nothing really conclusive. There's&nbsp; kind of a a conspiracy literature about that that&nbsp;&nbsp; exists that you can see find on the internet&nbsp; and find in various publications and so on where&nbsp;&nbsp; people will show x-rays and they there always&nbsp; is somewhere in the x-ray what is supposed to&nbsp;&nbsp; be an implant but it's kind of vague usually&nbsp; and not really absolutely documented. I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; think that's because it's not going on. I think&nbsp; it's just because the documentation hasn't been&nbsp;&nbsp; fished out yet. I haven't myself uh had a patient&nbsp; who comes in for treatment and I've been able to&nbsp;&nbsp; document that there's implants in this person's&nbsp; brain. So the documented evidence indicates that&nbsp;&nbsp; they're able to use implants for control purposes&nbsp; and also to receive information from a person's&nbsp;&nbsp; brain. Is that correct? Guy Jolly West who is the&nbsp; expert witness for uh Patty Hurst who is also the&nbsp;&nbsp; military and CIA contractor who's an expert on&nbsp; multiple personality and different things. He&nbsp;&nbsp; actually mentions multiple personality in his CIA&nbsp; MK Ultra proposal. uh he tried to set up this UCLA&nbsp;&nbsp; violence center that was going to be funded by&nbsp; Ronald Reagan and Frank Irvin from the Harvard&nbsp;&nbsp; brain electrode implant team was going to come and&nbsp; one of the uh things that was going to be done at&nbsp;&nbsp; the UCLA violence project and also was going to&nbsp; be done at Vakavville State Prison under separate&nbsp;&nbsp; administrative structure but which got shut down&nbsp; by public protest was they were going to implant&nbsp;&nbsp; brain electrodes in violent uh sex offenders and&nbsp; then they were going to do two things. They were&nbsp;&nbsp; going to use the electrodes as kind of like a&nbsp; electronic bracelet inside the person's head. So&nbsp;&nbsp; they were going to monitor the person's location&nbsp; because of transmissions from the implanted&nbsp;&nbsp; electrodes and then they would know if the person&nbsp; had gone out of this is after their discharge&nbsp;&nbsp; from prison. They would know if the person had&nbsp; gone outside their restricted area. Also they&nbsp;&nbsp; would be able to monitor the person's level of&nbsp; sexual arousal through the brain electrodes.&nbsp;&nbsp; So if the guy was outside his restricted area&nbsp; and was starting to get sexually aroused, what&nbsp;&nbsp; they would do would be then transmit a signal to&nbsp; him that would just paralyze him. And one of the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh things that was going to be done at the&nbsp; UCLA violence project and also was going to be&nbsp;&nbsp; done at Vakavville State Prison under a separate&nbsp; administrative structure but which got shut down&nbsp;&nbsp; by public protest was they were going to implant&nbsp; brain electrodes in violent uh sex offenders and&nbsp;&nbsp; then they were going to do two things. They were&nbsp; going to use the electrodes as kind of like a&nbsp;&nbsp; electronic bracelet inside the person's head. So&nbsp; they were going to monitor the person's location&nbsp;&nbsp; because of transmissions from the implanted&nbsp; electrodes and then they would know if the person&nbsp;&nbsp; had gone out of this is after their discharge&nbsp; from prison. They would know if the person had&nbsp;&nbsp; gone outside their restricted area. Also they&nbsp; would be able to monitor the person's level of&nbsp;&nbsp; sexual arousal through the brain electrodes. And&nbsp; so if the guy was outside his restricted area and&nbsp;&nbsp; was starting to get sexually aroused, what they&nbsp; would do would be then transmit a signal to him&nbsp;&nbsp; that would just paralyze him, just make him like&nbsp; go catatonic or stop in his tracks and not move.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then they would notify the police who would&nbsp; go pick him up. And the there's a book called&nbsp;&nbsp; Violence in the Brain by two of these Harvard&nbsp; brain electrode people. and they discuss maybe&nbsp;&nbsp; using these kind of electrodes to deal with people&nbsp; who are w rioting like the Watts riots and so on&nbsp;&nbsp; that were going on at that time. So there was a&nbsp; whole scheme about how we were going to control&nbsp;&nbsp; bad people in the population that we didn't&nbsp; like and and this is their own uh literature&nbsp;&nbsp; and own documentation that uh you're getting&nbsp; this information from. This is all completely&nbsp;&nbsp; published, objective, real, exists type stuff.&nbsp; And does it go into detail about uh how the the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh um electronic delivery mechanism is it by&nbsp; satellite or by some kind of radio that they would&nbsp;&nbsp; receive and send signals? Yeah, some um I don't&nbsp; know a whole lot about the technical side of it,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it was uh this is back in the 60s and 70s, so&nbsp; they wouldn't have been doing satellite uplinks&nbsp;&nbsp; on that at that point yet. Uh it would be some&nbsp; sort of line of sight radio beam of some kind.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing that uh also is documented in um&nbsp; there's a journal called Defense Electronics in&nbsp;&nbsp; the July 1993 issue. Uh there's a one-page article&nbsp; there that describes technology that's under&nbsp;&nbsp; development. There's a Russian guy who specializes&nbsp; in this stuff. His name is Igor Smirnov. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp; basically technology for beaming different forms&nbsp; of radiation at people's heads. can either and&nbsp;&nbsp; there's about four or five MK Ultra projects that&nbsp; were on this kind of stuff. So, it can be either a&nbsp;&nbsp; sound energy uh percussion sound percussion waves&nbsp; uh or different types of light and radio frequency&nbsp;&nbsp; and all kinds of different types of energy. So,&nbsp; the Igor Smirnov is a specialist in this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff who has technology that he's developed. He&nbsp; was brought has technology that he's developed. He&nbsp;&nbsp; was brought over in um March of 1993 to a meeting&nbsp; in Northern Virginia that was attended by the CIA,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Defense Intelligence Agency. I think I&nbsp; remember the list, right? One of these might be&nbsp;&nbsp; wrong, but definitely the CIA, definitely the FBI,&nbsp; I think the Defense Intelligence Agency, I think&nbsp;&nbsp; the National Security Agency, a representative&nbsp; from General Electronics, and a representative&nbsp;&nbsp; from one of the universities who all got&nbsp; together to discuss the possibility of using this&nbsp;&nbsp; technology on David Kuresh and this was during&nbsp; the branch devidian siege. And according to the&nbsp;&nbsp; article, the reason they decided not to use this&nbsp; technology on him was uh problems with software&nbsp;&nbsp; compatibility between the Russian software and&nbsp; the American hardware. And what happened as an&nbsp;&nbsp; upshot at the meeting was that a term called a&nbsp; firm called Psycho Technologies that's based in&nbsp;&nbsp; uh in Virginia, I forget which town in Virginia,&nbsp; actually contracted with the Russians to develop&nbsp;&nbsp; this kind of technology for possible American&nbsp; usage. So that's all stuff that's actually real&nbsp;&nbsp; that's actually going on that's undergoing some&nbsp; sort of research and development. Currently in the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh MK Ultra projects, they also describe&nbsp; implanting brain electrodes in various kinds&nbsp;&nbsp; of animals including dolphins and using them&nbsp; as delivery systems for biological and chemical&nbsp;&nbsp; weapons. So that's actually in the CIA materials&nbsp; and they describe further research to fine-tune&nbsp;&nbsp; those kind of systems that were already&nbsp; in successful operational use. Do you have&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence of DIA involvement in the mind control&nbsp; experiments? Have you been able to get any DIA&nbsp;&nbsp; documentation? The for listeners that don't know,&nbsp; the DIA is the Defense Intelligence Agency. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that's the DIA is something like uh&nbsp; 10 times the size of the CIA as well. Actually,&nbsp;&nbsp; the CIA, the the director of the CIA controls&nbsp; only about 10% of the financial assets of the&nbsp;&nbsp; American intelligence community, meaning that the&nbsp; CIA is really a tiny fragment of all of military&nbsp;&nbsp; and civilian intelligence in the United States.&nbsp; The National Security Agency and the Defense&nbsp;&nbsp; Intelligence Agency are both quite a bit bigger.&nbsp; Um, the answer to your question is yes and no. The&nbsp;&nbsp; no part is I don't have uh direct documentation of&nbsp; defense intelligence agency mind control contracts&nbsp;&nbsp; but it's really kind of beside the point&nbsp; because all of these intelligence agencies&nbsp;&nbsp; are all interconnected with each other right for&nbsp; instance the CIA had two programs MK Ultra and MK&nbsp;&nbsp; Naomi and they uh got federal funds which they&nbsp; then put into MK Naomi and NK Naomi then funded&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the special operations division at Fort&nbsp; Detectric and Edgeware Arsenal to do mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; research. So, and that's the way it is with the&nbsp; radiation experiments too. The atomic energy&nbsp;&nbsp; commission, health, education, welfare, the CIA,&nbsp; all kinds of different government agencies are all&nbsp;&nbsp; interlin and interconnected. One of the um Defense&nbsp; Intelligence Agency programs was called Stargate.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a liaison between the CIA and the&nbsp; Defense Intelligence Agency on that. It was just&nbsp;&nbsp; declassified about roughly within the last year.&nbsp; Um, and there was a a program on in December on uh&nbsp;&nbsp; ABC TV, ABC's Night Line program in December where&nbsp; Bill Gates, who was a former head of the CIA,&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the guys who was the CIA person who was in&nbsp; responsible for less on between the CIA and the&nbsp;&nbsp; military on Stargate and one of the guys who was&nbsp; a Stargate contractor all talking about Stargate.&nbsp;&nbsp; uh which they admitted ran up until at least&nbsp; 1984 and had funding of at least $20 million,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is probably just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; And Stargate was a remote viewing program. So the&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence agencies all in an interconnected&nbsp; fashion uh spent millions of dollars on remote&nbsp;&nbsp; viewing, which is basically having psychics lie&nbsp; down on a table and try and see what's going on&nbsp;&nbsp; at some location in a foreign country to gather&nbsp; intelligence information. There's a book that was&nbsp;&nbsp; just published by um uh something Joseph Michael&nbsp; Joseph I think it is which is a branch of Penguin&nbsp;&nbsp; and British branch of Penguin books called Psychic&nbsp; Warrior where a guy describes being one of these&nbsp;&nbsp; remote viewers. A lot of that work was done at&nbsp; the Stanford Research Institute in uh PaloAlto,&nbsp;&nbsp; California. So I mentioned that partly because&nbsp; it's interesting partly because if you think&nbsp;&nbsp; that creating multiple personality disorder&nbsp; is too bizarre and strange to be real. Again,&nbsp;&nbsp; you have to look at this LSD, this brain electrode&nbsp; research, some of the sensory deprivation that&nbsp;&nbsp; Ames leaf room with those anisonic lenses using uh&nbsp; millions and millions and millions of dollars to&nbsp;&nbsp; pay psychics to spy on other countries while lying&nbsp; on tables in the United States. Once you have that&nbsp;&nbsp; context, then creating multiple personality just&nbsp; seems kind of small. Now what what is like uh I&nbsp;&nbsp; understand that the what's driving this was the&nbsp; cold war uh you know back from the information&nbsp;&nbsp; that we've got back late that's true and not&nbsp; true right but let me explain why it's true&nbsp;&nbsp; and not true okay just briefly that's actually&nbsp; a disinformation setup the term brainwashing was&nbsp;&nbsp; invented by uh a man named Edward Hunter who wrote&nbsp; a book about brainwashing in the early 1950s that&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a copy of. So he invented that term and&nbsp; described how the um American pilots and prisoners&nbsp;&nbsp; of war in the Korean War who were captured by&nbsp; the Chinese and then were made to sign false germ&nbsp;&nbsp; warfare confessions and were converted to being&nbsp; communists had been brainwashed. And then the&nbsp;&nbsp; whole idea was that the CIA and other intelligence&nbsp; agencies had to figure out how that happened. and&nbsp;&nbsp; Jolly West, Margaret Singer, and Robert Lifton&nbsp; who testified at the Patty Hurst trial. They all&nbsp;&nbsp; interviewed these returning prisoners of war&nbsp; in the Korean War and became experts on mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control and cult thought reform techniques and so&nbsp; on. So, the idea was that because the communists&nbsp;&nbsp; were doing that, we had to figure out how to&nbsp; combat that. So, it was mainly defensive and&nbsp;&nbsp; it was reactive to what the communist Chinese&nbsp; were doing. But that's not true. uh because&nbsp;&nbsp; GHBs was already doing that stuff in the second&nbsp; world war or you know way before the Korean war.&nbsp;&nbsp; So actually there was an offensive program of mind&nbsp; control by the OSS and other intelligence agencies&nbsp;&nbsp; uh 10 years before the Korean War. So the whole&nbsp; idea that it was got started because of the cold&nbsp;&nbsp; war is disinformation but then it obviously got&nbsp; fueled and entrenched by the cold war. And then&nbsp;&nbsp; the question becomes well the cold war is over.&nbsp; Why do we need that stuff anymore? Right? And&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the answer is severalfold. One is we in&nbsp; fact do need to have intelligence agencies. The&nbsp;&nbsp; world is not a safe place. And for us not to be&nbsp; living in Siberia and getting sent to labor camps&nbsp;&nbsp; in Siberia, we've got to protect ourselves from&nbsp; all kinds of forces in the world. And to do that,&nbsp;&nbsp; we have to have intelligence agencies. So I I&nbsp; have no beef with the CIA as such or the existence&nbsp;&nbsp; of intelligence agencies. I think they're&nbsp; essential to maintaining freedom and democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp; But once you've got intelligence agencies, you&nbsp; got the military and you got a bunch of budgets,&nbsp;&nbsp; you got people who like any federal bureaucrats&nbsp; have to justify their exper their budgets and&nbsp;&nbsp; their programs and everything. You got people&nbsp; who are already into this and you've got actual&nbsp;&nbsp; applications of it. And so it it'll just carry on,&nbsp; I think, indefinitely. And the fact that the Cold&nbsp;&nbsp; War is over, I don't see as being a major item&nbsp; in this stuff stopping. Now you mentioned in your&nbsp;&nbsp; previous lecture that you as you said you don't&nbsp; blame the CIA per se but uh the psychiatrists&nbsp;&nbsp; and doctors that are involved in this. Do you not&nbsp; feel that the CIA is uh hold some responsibility&nbsp;&nbsp; in funding and allowing the uh the doctors and&nbsp; psychiatrists to operate? Oh absolutely. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like these people definitely were I mean the&nbsp; victims of all of this definitely did not give&nbsp;&nbsp; informed consent. Uh definitely it was unethical.&nbsp; It was harmful. there was damages, they deserve&nbsp;&nbsp; compensation and the federal government's on&nbsp; the hook for that. And so the idea is not that&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sort of soft on the CIA or apologetic for&nbsp; them. It's just that I'm basically psychiatrist,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? So my number one concern is with all&nbsp; this bizarre, unethical, destructive conduct by&nbsp;&nbsp; my colleagues and the medical ethics of it and&nbsp; getting the medical profession under control.&nbsp;&nbsp; So what I think needs to happen is that it&nbsp; should no longer be allowed that psychiatrist,&nbsp;&nbsp; psychologists, doctors have funding from the&nbsp; CIA or the military without the subjects of the&nbsp;&nbsp; research knowing where the money is coming from&nbsp; and knowing that it's not really medical research&nbsp;&nbsp; as such. It's military intelligence warfare,&nbsp; psychological warfare, mind control research.&nbsp;&nbsp; um in some of the literature uh seems to suggest&nbsp; that Canada was offered up to supply so-called&nbsp;&nbsp; guinea pigs for the US mind control experiments.&nbsp; Um I'm particularly referring to um the Al&nbsp;&nbsp; Memorial at McGill University in Montreal with Dr.&nbsp; Cameron. What do you think has Canada's role been&nbsp;&nbsp; in in the US military mind control experiments?&nbsp; Well, the uh Canadian Psychiatric Association&nbsp;&nbsp; um put out some disinformation that's been&nbsp; pretty well bought by the Canadian public&nbsp;&nbsp; and that is that you and Cameron, it was just an&nbsp; isolated incident. Happened a long time ago back&nbsp;&nbsp; in the ' 50s that he had CIA funding. There were&nbsp; sort of different ethical standards back then.&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, we wouldn't approve it now, but it was&nbsp; just a one-time deal and he was such a great man,&nbsp;&nbsp; we can overlook it. Well, that's not true because&nbsp; that research completely violated the ethical&nbsp;&nbsp; standards of the time. But also, it wasn't an&nbsp; isolated incident. In fact, you Cameron wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp; even the only person at McGill at that time with&nbsp; CIA funding. Dr. Raymond Prince was funded through&nbsp;&nbsp; MK Ultra sub project 121 to do um anthropological&nbsp; psychiatry research in Nigeria. He didn't know at&nbsp;&nbsp; the time it was CIA money. Donald Heb who is the&nbsp; chairman of the department of psychology there did&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of sensory deprivation experiments funded&nbsp; by Canada's defense research board when the CIA&nbsp;&nbsp; stopped funding you and Cameron's work health&nbsp; education and welfare Canada just picked it up&nbsp;&nbsp; and continued this incredibly unethical harmful&nbsp; destructive research that wiped out people's&nbsp;&nbsp; memories for their whole lives um there's a man&nbsp; named Hassan Azima who is a psychiatrist who died&nbsp;&nbsp; of cancer in his early 40s who was being groomed&nbsp; assumed to be a mind control researcher who was&nbsp;&nbsp; doing LSD and sensory deprivation experiments at&nbsp; McGill and who was presenting u at conferences&nbsp;&nbsp; where all these other military and CIA funded&nbsp; people were at. So he was in the loop. Um James&nbsp;&nbsp; Tyhurst who in 1951 was part of a committee&nbsp; meeting to oversee Bluebird and Artichoke in&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada before you and Cameron got his money. uh&nbsp; was also uh funded by Canada's defense research&nbsp;&nbsp; board. He did LSD research also at MC Hollywood&nbsp; Hospital in Vancouver and uh doctor named Ross&nbsp;&nbsp; Mlan who was a director at Hollywood Hospital in&nbsp; Vancouver attended a CIA sponsored LSD symposium&nbsp;&nbsp; and described giving LSD to 338 different patients&nbsp; at Hollywood Hospital. So there's a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; military LSD flowing into Vancouver. Then Abram&nbsp; Hoffer and Humphrey Osman did a lot of military&nbsp;&nbsp; LSD research in Saskatchewan. And Humphrey&nbsp; Osman then left and moved down to the New Jersey&nbsp;&nbsp; neurosychiatric institute in Pennsylvania where&nbsp; Carl Feifer was which is where the Louis Castillo&nbsp;&nbsp; guy was who was over in the Philippines and got&nbsp; arrested by the FBI over there. So there's been&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of connections with Canadian psychiatry. A&nbsp; spin-off of all of that. Some of the research is&nbsp;&nbsp; funded by the military or the CIA or whoever&nbsp; and then that gets published and presented&nbsp;&nbsp; at conferences and talked about and then other&nbsp; civilian psychiatrists who aren't directly funded&nbsp;&nbsp; by the CIA start doing the same kind of stuff. Hm.&nbsp; An example of that was at uh Penitentanglishing&nbsp;&nbsp; Hospital which is the up on Lake Hiron there where&nbsp; there's a basically a heavy duty facility for&nbsp;&nbsp; people who are criminally insane, not guilty by&nbsp; reason of insanity, unfit to stand trial. In the&nbsp;&nbsp; years about 1968-69, there's four papers published&nbsp; in the Canadian Psychiatric Association Journal,&nbsp;&nbsp; which you can go to any of the medical school&nbsp; libraries in Canada and just pull it off the&nbsp;&nbsp; shelf and read it. This psychiatrist named Elliot&nbsp; Barker, who's still alive, was working there. He&nbsp;&nbsp; invented a little room called the capsule that was&nbsp; about 8 by 10 ft. He would put prisoners as young&nbsp;&nbsp; as 15 going up into early 30s in this capsule in&nbsp; groups of either two up to uh seven at a time for&nbsp;&nbsp; periods of days up to as 11 days at a time all&nbsp; naked and often on LSD. So there's all these&nbsp;&nbsp; violent offenders, murderers, arsonists, rapists&nbsp; and so on. And he would have them in this little&nbsp;&nbsp; small capsule all naked on LSD kind of doing&nbsp; rap sessions and therapy groups with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the um room would be monitored by other&nbsp; prisoners through the uh either video link&nbsp;&nbsp; or camera link or through a mirror in the ceiling&nbsp; and other prisoners were responsible for supplying&nbsp;&nbsp; them food and so on. There was a one toilet inside&nbsp; the capsule and they would be signaled to change&nbsp;&nbsp; from one kind of therapy group to another by&nbsp; changing the kind color of the light that was&nbsp;&nbsp; shown into the room. So they were in this kind of&nbsp; group sensory deprivation with changing colored&nbsp;&nbsp; lights and um the idea was that this would get&nbsp; through their defenses and then get to the real&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff and do real therapy. One of the co-authors&nbsp; on one of these patients is an HM Mason who's at&nbsp;&nbsp; the bottom of the paper it says that he was a&nbsp; patient at this Oakidge facility in Penitentang&nbsp;&nbsp; on a ward called F-Ward that a documentary was&nbsp; made about it by the CBC. actually have a copy&nbsp;&nbsp; of a video of it. So, this HM is both one of these&nbsp; patients who are all murderers and arsonists and&nbsp;&nbsp; rapists and so on who's in this capsule getting&nbsp; LSD and he's also a co-author on the paper. And&nbsp;&nbsp; then apparently uh several of the former inmates&nbsp; lived with Elliot Barker post discharge. And this&nbsp;&nbsp; uh HM Mason, as far as I can tell, is the&nbsp; same guy as Hank Mason. Hank Mason is on&nbsp;&nbsp; the web page of the Canadian Society for the&nbsp; Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which is&nbsp;&nbsp; um just what it says. It's Canadian Society for&nbsp; Prevention of Cruelty to the Children. The current&nbsp;&nbsp; president is Elliot Barker. And this Hank Mason&nbsp; has got a who is identified as a founding member&nbsp;&nbsp; of the society has a little statement about child&nbsp; abuse on the web page. So it would appear that the&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian Society for the Prevention of Cruelty&nbsp; of the Children has had executive members who&nbsp;&nbsp; are former uh violent criminals in a facility&nbsp; for the criminally insane currently being run by&nbsp;&nbsp; psychiatrists who did all this kind of research&nbsp; who published it in the Canadian Psychiatric&nbsp;&nbsp; Association journal. Interesting. Just the kind of&nbsp; stuff that it goes on and on and on and on and on&nbsp;&nbsp; with more stories like this. What's your sense&nbsp; of how many Canadian centers and doctors that&nbsp;&nbsp; were involved in the experimentations? Uh well,&nbsp; absolute minimum of 5 to 10. Mhm. Centers or&nbsp;&nbsp; uh doctors and centers? Yeah. Okay. I mean for&nbsp; sure there was McGill um Wurn Saskatchewan and&nbsp;&nbsp; University of Saskatchewan, Hollywood Hospital,&nbsp; um another hospital in Montreal where LS Divas.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I forget if it was Montreal General.&nbsp; I think it was Montreal general, but I'm not&nbsp;&nbsp; sure about that. I have it documented somewhere.&nbsp; Then the same kind of stuff apparently not funded&nbsp;&nbsp; by the military or intelligence was community was&nbsp; going on at Penitentang. Is there any indication&nbsp;&nbsp; that uh experiments were being done on military&nbsp; bases themselves? Uh not documented evidence, but&nbsp;&nbsp; there's quite a few accounts from patients that&nbsp; are unverified. Yeah. Right. Um you mentioned that&nbsp;&nbsp; like some of the uh doctors that were involved in&nbsp; this research were unwitting. What uh what kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of funding uh um institutes were set up to fund&nbsp; this kind of research to unwitting doctors? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; they use what they called cutouts. A cutout is&nbsp; a front funding organization. The three major&nbsp;&nbsp; ones were the human ecology foundation, the Josiah&nbsp; Macy Jr. Foundation and the Kashikar Medical Fund.&nbsp;&nbsp; So each of these would be funded from the CIA and&nbsp; then in turn they would fund right and the people&nbsp;&nbsp; who were running those organizations knew that it&nbsp; was CIA money and often themselves got grants from&nbsp;&nbsp; the CIA. One of the guys who was on the board of&nbsp; the human ecology foundation who reviewed grants&nbsp;&nbsp; for the human ecology foundation and himself got&nbsp; an MK Ultra grant and had top secret clearance&nbsp;&nbsp; was Carl Rogers. That's kind of amazing because&nbsp; Carl Rogers is best known for client- centered&nbsp;&nbsp; therapy which is a kind of humanistic valuing&nbsp; the spiritual worth of the client kind of therapy&nbsp;&nbsp; where you have to have uh accurate empathy&nbsp; unconditional positive regard for the person&nbsp;&nbsp; and genuine uh empathy. So it's a it's like the&nbsp; stereotype most humanistic touchyfey psychotherapy&nbsp;&nbsp; going and he was actually uh top secret cleared&nbsp; and funding secret CI mind control research. Now, there's a lot of uh doctors and uh some&nbsp; therapists out there that um dismiss the idea&nbsp;&nbsp; of of multiple personalities. And um um one&nbsp; of the things that some of these people are&nbsp;&nbsp; saying is that it's doesn't exist and that&nbsp; it's actually temporal lobe epilepsy. What&nbsp;&nbsp; is temporal lobe epilepsy and and how is it&nbsp; similar to MPD? Well, temporal lobe epilepsy&nbsp;&nbsp; is just a form of epilepsy that takes place&nbsp; in the temporal lobe of your brain. So there's&nbsp;&nbsp; abnormal electrical discharges that cause you to&nbsp; have a seizure. A typical temporal lobe seizure&nbsp;&nbsp; invol lasts for 30 to 90 seconds. You may become&nbsp; unconscious or just get a kind of foggy state of&nbsp;&nbsp; consciousness and you'll usually like fumble&nbsp; at one of your buttons or smack your lips or&nbsp;&nbsp; turn your body in a very kind of mechanistic over&nbsp; and over same little motion kind of way and then&nbsp;&nbsp; you pop out of it after 30 seconds usually. So&nbsp; temporal load epilepsy is completely unrelated&nbsp;&nbsp; to multiple personality disorder. That's just a&nbsp; bogus prejudice. And there's a bunch of research&nbsp;&nbsp; that I and others have done that show that the&nbsp; symptom picture of temporal epilepsy and multiple&nbsp;&nbsp; personality are completely different from each&nbsp; other. Why why would these people be making these&nbsp;&nbsp; claims? What what would be, you know, why the&nbsp; confusion? Uh because they're they don't take&nbsp;&nbsp; accurate histories. They're very vague about what&nbsp; they say and they just look grasping at straws&nbsp;&nbsp; for some way to discredit multiple personality.&nbsp; Basically, the the more serious criticism is that&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple personality is often unwittingly created&nbsp; by bad therapists. No, that I agree with and I've&nbsp;&nbsp; actually testified about that in court that&nbsp; in cases where I'm testifying for the patient&nbsp;&nbsp; who's suing the therapist and I'm stating as&nbsp; an expert witness that yes, this was created&nbsp;&nbsp; by the therapist and yes, all these memories were&nbsp; false and yes, it did all this harm. Now, this is&nbsp;&nbsp; a very complex issue and one that's being hotly&nbsp; debated by the public. Um, the the main thing is&nbsp;&nbsp; that there actually is a whole bunch of science&nbsp; about multiple personality and dissociation. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; not just a matter of belief. There's a a big&nbsp; literature now that has flaws in it and so on,&nbsp;&nbsp; but there's actually a whole bunch of science.&nbsp; It's not just I believe or I don't believe. The&nbsp;&nbsp; the curious twist in the logic is that actually&nbsp; I think that all of this uh documentation that&nbsp;&nbsp; the military and the CIA have been creating&nbsp; experimental multiple personality and using&nbsp;&nbsp; it in operations actually proves that multiple&nbsp; personality is real. It proves two things. One&nbsp;&nbsp; is that unless they're just wasting money, they're&nbsp; not going to bother with the whole exercise unless&nbsp;&nbsp; you actually can create a new identity that&nbsp; actually is hidden behind a real memory barrier.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, there'll be no point, right? And that&nbsp; could be that could be used operationally, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; So then the none of it's actually really really&nbsp; really real. It's all illusions inside your mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; There isn't literally another person in there,&nbsp; but nobody in the multiple personality field is&nbsp;&nbsp; saying that it's literally real anyway to start&nbsp; with. But you can create this artificial second&nbsp;&nbsp; identity and it can actually do stuff that the&nbsp; main part of the person doesn't remember. That has&nbsp;&nbsp; to be true otherwise there would be no point in&nbsp; creating it for military use. And so that proves&nbsp;&nbsp; two things. One is that it's possible to create&nbsp; multiple personality by a mistake in a bad therapy&nbsp;&nbsp; that mimics a lot of the conditions of military&nbsp; mind control or cult mind control. But also if you&nbsp;&nbsp; have a disorder that can be created deliberately&nbsp; either be by the CIA, by a destructive cult, by a&nbsp;&nbsp; therapist who doesn't really know what they're&nbsp; doing or even by the person themselves, then&nbsp;&nbsp; it's not really a big jump to imagine that that it&nbsp; could also happen just naturally and spontaneously&nbsp;&nbsp; as a way of coping with trauma. Right. So the very&nbsp; fact that you can create it artificially to me&nbsp;&nbsp; indicates that it can be created artificially by&nbsp; mistake or on purpose and also that it's likely to&nbsp;&nbsp; happen naturally. Well, the other question is&nbsp; h how they managed to create it artificially.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and is it a traumatic I'm writing about all&nbsp; this now. I have a number of case histories that&nbsp;&nbsp; describe it in quite a lot of detail. There's a&nbsp; the there's a lot of information about how they&nbsp;&nbsp; created Tanya and Patty Hurst. It's very detailed.&nbsp; There's a very good case from Denmark. A guy named&nbsp;&nbsp; Pali Hardrop who was uh in jail in the let's&nbsp; see now late 40s in Denmark. Another prisoner&nbsp;&nbsp; named Bujornne Nielsen used a whole lot of mind&nbsp; control and hypnosis techniques and created this&nbsp;&nbsp; uh and music bank robber and pi hardrip actually&nbsp; went out and robbed a bank and then he robbed&nbsp;&nbsp; another bank tried to rob a second bank shot&nbsp; two people didn't get away with any money got&nbsp;&nbsp; captured and the net outcome of the huge trial&nbsp; with 50 witnesses and all kinds of psychiatric&nbsp;&nbsp; testimony and so on. The net outcome of it was&nbsp; that this Bejorn Nielsen guy was found guilty and&nbsp;&nbsp; sentenced to jail even though he wasn't physically&nbsp; present at any of the robberies and Pali Hardrop&nbsp;&nbsp; was found kind of an equivalent of not guilty by&nbsp; reason of insanity and they ex specifically said&nbsp;&nbsp; at the trial all the experts did that this Bejorn&nbsp; Neielson guy used hypnosis and other methods to&nbsp;&nbsp; create a split identity hardrip. So these kind of&nbsp; cases have actually come to trial and there's a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of detail on them. What what would these other&nbsp; methods be and what would the links be between&nbsp;&nbsp; the methods used for create artificially creating&nbsp; multiple personalities and childhood trauma? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; the links are severalfold. One is you have to&nbsp; have a pretty good control over the person's life&nbsp;&nbsp; space. You can't just see them for half an hour,&nbsp; an hour a week and that's all that's required.&nbsp;&nbsp; So in the palihardy case, these two guys were&nbsp; salemates, cellmates and also they worked in&nbsp;&nbsp; the same workshop and were basically with each&nbsp; other constantly for about 18 months. Uh if you&nbsp;&nbsp; can isolate the person from the outside world&nbsp; from contact with other people who are going&nbsp;&nbsp; to be critical of what's going on or give a&nbsp; different point of view that's helpful. These&nbsp;&nbsp; are these things apply to destructive cults and&nbsp; also deliberate creation of multiple personality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then if you can uh use all kinds of thought reform&nbsp; techniques that is getting the person to study&nbsp;&nbsp; doctrine do all kinds of meditation exercises,&nbsp; chanting exercises, hypnotic focusing exercises,&nbsp;&nbsp; internal dream imagery exercises, you get their&nbsp; mind kind of into a trance state and focused on&nbsp;&nbsp; what you want them to believe and focus on. Then&nbsp; you actually use formal hypnosis some or drugs and&nbsp;&nbsp; then you deliberately instruct them that you&nbsp; want to create a second identity and then you&nbsp;&nbsp; figure out what is it that this person's going&nbsp; to be motivated by. So in the pali hardrip case&nbsp;&nbsp; uh this bejorn neielson guy created uh guardian&nbsp; spirit x and whenever bejorn neielson was speaking&nbsp;&nbsp; to pi hardrop it was actually ex who was talking&nbsp; through bejorn neielsen and he got pi hardup to&nbsp;&nbsp; buy into that cuz he was interested in all&nbsp; kinds of new age type stuff and then uh ex&nbsp;&nbsp; started teaching him the path to enlightenment&nbsp; and so the basic motivator was that he was going&nbsp;&nbsp; to get to enlightenment and if he didn't follow&nbsp; follow the doctrine, didn't follow the rules,&nbsp;&nbsp; didn't follow all the tests, and didn't perform&nbsp; adequately, then he would lose X and he would lose&nbsp;&nbsp; his path to enlightenment. And that was the thing&nbsp; that he was most obsessed with. So that was the&nbsp;&nbsp; carrot that kept him going. So you have to find&nbsp; some sort of carrot that'll keep the person going.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then uh you can use uh any number of&nbsp; different kinds of behavior modification&nbsp;&nbsp; techniques which could be uh punishing the person&nbsp; if they say what you don't want them to say,&nbsp;&nbsp; rewarding them if they say what you do want&nbsp; them to say. And it I mean I could go on with&nbsp;&nbsp; the list a little bit but basically you have to&nbsp; get control over the person's thoughts over their&nbsp;&nbsp; life space and you have to set up a reward and&nbsp; punishment system to steer them along the path&nbsp;&nbsp; you want so that they become kind of robots who&nbsp; just repeat the doctrine that you want and then&nbsp;&nbsp; if you want to create the second identity you&nbsp; can use uh all kinds of threats or you can use&nbsp;&nbsp; actual trauma and fear and the trauma and the fear&nbsp; and the agitation the upset drive the splitting&nbsp;&nbsp; of the mind. just naturally cuz the human mind&nbsp; tends to split or dissociate in some way to cope&nbsp;&nbsp; with trauma all the time, right? Whether it be a&nbsp; plane crash or natural disaster or sexual assault&nbsp;&nbsp; in adulthood. And then the other ingredient with&nbsp; children is that their minds just seem to be more&nbsp;&nbsp; susceptible to this kind of splitting process.&nbsp; The their child's mind tends to do that naturally. You're listening to 88.1. We'll be right back&nbsp;&nbsp; with the second half of this interview&nbsp; with Dr. Colin Ross right after this. Are you familiar with Jennifer Fried's work with&nbsp; her theory of betrayal trauma when it deals with&nbsp;&nbsp; child abuse? Actually, the I wasn't going into&nbsp; all of this here, but the main change in my&nbsp;&nbsp; thinking in terms of how I work with these people&nbsp; clinically over the last 3 years has been shifting&nbsp;&nbsp; much more towards a betrayal trauma type way of&nbsp; looking at things. Mhm. That's not really directly&nbsp;&nbsp; related to mind control, but yeah, I like her&nbsp; theory a lot and I agree with it. Right. Um, the&nbsp;&nbsp; false memory people, Jennifer Fried, for listeners&nbsp; who don't know, is the daughter of Pamela and&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter Fried. Pamela Fried's the executive director&nbsp; of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation. And the&nbsp;&nbsp; False Memory Syndrome Foundation takes a point&nbsp; of view that multiple personality is pretty bogus&nbsp;&nbsp; and all these memories that people in therapy are&nbsp; recovering are all false. And it's just a result&nbsp;&nbsp; of basically of mind control techniques by bad&nbsp; therapists. Um the the scientific advisory board&nbsp;&nbsp; of the false memory syndrome foundation which is&nbsp; a whole bunch of academics and experts who advise&nbsp;&nbsp; the foundation and sort of speak on behalf&nbsp; of it include Martin or Jolly West who had&nbsp;&nbsp; top secret CIA clearance. uh Harold Leaf who is&nbsp; the personal psychiatrist to the Friedes also uh&nbsp;&nbsp; was a co-author of Robert Heath who did the brain&nbsp; electrode research at Tain that was funded by the&nbsp;&nbsp; various branches of the military and the CIA and&nbsp; there's um about five of Martin Orin's co-authors&nbsp;&nbsp; or people that he thanks in publications of&nbsp; his uh going back into the 50s different mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control research that he did who are also on&nbsp; the board. Margaret Singer who interviewed&nbsp;&nbsp; these Korean prisoners of war who had top secret&nbsp; clearance through the military to do that work&nbsp;&nbsp; is also on the board. Um so there's a quite&nbsp; an connection and overlap between these false&nbsp;&nbsp; memory syndrome foundation people not all of them&nbsp; but a subgroup of them and all this military mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control research. Have you had any experiences&nbsp; with the false memory syndrome foundation? And I&nbsp;&nbsp; understand they have been fairly aggressive in uh&nbsp; in intimidating uh therapists uh throughout North&nbsp;&nbsp; America. Well, North America. Well, I've had&nbsp; a fair bit of experience with the False Memory&nbsp;&nbsp; Syndrome Foundation. I sub I belong to the False&nbsp; Memory Syndrome Foundation. I get their newsletter&nbsp;&nbsp; and I've um been talked about and have written&nbsp; in their newsletter. I set up a workshop in uh&nbsp;&nbsp; Houston where I spoke for a day and a half and&nbsp; Pamela Fried the executive director spoke for half&nbsp;&nbsp; a day and I've set up about five or six workshops&nbsp; that I've done with Elizabeth Loftess who's a one&nbsp;&nbsp; of the leading members of the advisory board. Um I&nbsp; get spoke at a meeting that Steven Cece was at. He&nbsp;&nbsp; spoke after me and he commented very favorably on&nbsp; my talk. He's on the advisory board. So, I've got&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of uh contacts with uh some of these people&nbsp; which I consider to be very friendly. I admire&nbsp;&nbsp; their work. Uh I disagree a little bit with some&nbsp; of the things I think. But by and large, I agree&nbsp;&nbsp; with probably over half of what the majority of&nbsp; people on the false memory syndrome advisory board&nbsp;&nbsp; say. And as I mentioned earlier, I've testified&nbsp; in court basically much the same as any of those&nbsp;&nbsp; people would. that here's an example of really bad&nbsp; therapy that created multiple personality out of&nbsp;&nbsp; nowhere and caused a lot of damage and harm to&nbsp; the person and their family. In the false memory&nbsp;&nbsp; syndrome sort of camp, not necessarily the&nbsp; organization itself, but in the kind of camp,&nbsp;&nbsp; there are people who are just real extremists have&nbsp; gone way overboard and they're very inflammatory&nbsp;&nbsp; in the way they talk and everything's all black&nbsp; and white and the whole multiple personality&nbsp;&nbsp; field is supposed to be totally bad and all the&nbsp; memories are completely false. And so there's&nbsp;&nbsp; people in that camp who go way overboard. My&nbsp; view on them is that if you take sort of set&nbsp;&nbsp; aside some of the really political posturing and&nbsp; the most kind of rabid politics that comes out and&nbsp;&nbsp; you just listen to kind of the basic message,&nbsp; I agree with it. I think it's been incredibly&nbsp;&nbsp; helpful to the field. Not just uh dissocive&nbsp; disorders field or sexual trauma therapists,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the entire mental health field really. In&nbsp; the 1980s, there was almost zero teaching on how&nbsp;&nbsp; errorprone memory is, almost no teaching at all&nbsp; about how to think about it, what to do about it,&nbsp;&nbsp; what guidelines we need. All these guidelines&nbsp; about false memories and memory not being reliable&nbsp;&nbsp; really have only come out of the professional&nbsp; organization starting in '94. And the False Memory&nbsp;&nbsp; Syndrome Foundation spearheaded that. So, a lot of&nbsp; the work they've done has been incredibly helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with it. And it's simply a fact that&nbsp; memory is very unreliable, right? It's just when&nbsp;&nbsp; you things get really polarized and everybody's&nbsp; really insulting everybody else and it's a big&nbsp;&nbsp; war, then it becomes ridiculous. Well, and and it&nbsp; seems that the survivors uh of abuse are are again&nbsp;&nbsp; revictimized by by this type of argument where um&nbsp; you know, the focus seems to be proving whether a&nbsp;&nbsp; memory was false or not instead of um actually um&nbsp; finding out whether abuse did happen or not. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; it gets all politicized and everybody gets very&nbsp; hot under the collar and very defensive about&nbsp;&nbsp; it. like in the in the false memory syndrome&nbsp; foundation the in the membership I'm sure that&nbsp;&nbsp; there are a whole bunch of people who actually&nbsp; are falsely accused but I'm sure there's also a&nbsp;&nbsp; whole bunch of people who are accurately accused&nbsp; and are just trying to run a little scam and say&nbsp;&nbsp; it's false memories right but that that needs to&nbsp; be set aside if you're trying to look at sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; scientifically what are the issues about memory&nbsp; and what's the best way to do therapy and how&nbsp;&nbsp; do you have to kind of balance things to have&nbsp; therapy that's hopefully more beneficial than&nbsp;&nbsp; more harmful if people would get off all of the&nbsp; ugly politics and have more of a sort of rational&nbsp;&nbsp; calm scientific discussion. It' be much better.&nbsp; And then uh you know then they wouldn't hear the&nbsp;&nbsp; therapist saying that the false memory people&nbsp; are all just pedophiles and you wouldn't hear&nbsp;&nbsp; the false memory people saying that the therapists&nbsp; are all insane. Now in your opinion, how has the&nbsp;&nbsp; false memory debate affected therapy resources&nbsp; available for survivors in in a general sense?&nbsp;&nbsp; Um well it's affected negatively basically because&nbsp; the a lot of the therapists have got real paranoid&nbsp;&nbsp; and there's a lot of agitation in um insurance&nbsp; companies and the managed care companies in the&nbsp;&nbsp; United States about this kind of therapy. Now the&nbsp; idea that most of the memories are false really is&nbsp;&nbsp; just the basic standard position of psychiatry&nbsp; through the whole 20th century. It's nothing&nbsp;&nbsp; new. How how do you feel that the debate has&nbsp; affected how therapists deal with their clients?&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I think it's been beneficial and harmful&nbsp; at the same time. It's been beneficial because&nbsp;&nbsp; therapists have had to get their act together&nbsp; a little bit and be more aware that memory is&nbsp;&nbsp; extremely vague and unreliable and that you&nbsp; can't take everything at face value. And then&nbsp;&nbsp; I've written at great length about strategically&nbsp; how to plan the therapy so that you do the same&nbsp;&nbsp; thing no matter what percentage of the memory is&nbsp; true or false. Most of the time you don't know for&nbsp;&nbsp; a fact. So, it's been very helpful in that way.&nbsp; And then it's been harmful in that uh it's just&nbsp;&nbsp; given an excuse to all kinds of people who don't&nbsp; want to deal with abuse anyway to say, "Oh, it's&nbsp;&nbsp; all false memories." And it's made the therapist&nbsp; defensive and it's taken a lot of time and energy&nbsp;&nbsp; away from treatment on to worrying about whether&nbsp; you're going to get sued or not. But you can't&nbsp;&nbsp; they're sort of opposite sides of the same coin.&nbsp; You you can't have therapists finally getting&nbsp;&nbsp; the message that they have to be more careful&nbsp; without also having therapists who are more&nbsp;&nbsp; paranoid about getting sued. U for the benefit&nbsp; of other therapists that might be listening,&nbsp;&nbsp; is there um a way to recognize signs of possible&nbsp; mind control experimentation? Are there signs that&nbsp;&nbsp; come up again and again in survivor accounts? Uh&nbsp; you mean actual military or intelligence agency&nbsp;&nbsp; mind control, right? Or because mind control&nbsp; can be done informally and unwittingly by just&nbsp;&nbsp; the pedophile father at home or it can be done by&nbsp; any one of the known destructive cults or it can&nbsp;&nbsp; be done as part of a military research program.&nbsp; So it depends which level you're talking about.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm speaking yeah specifically of the government&nbsp; uh funded experiments. No, there's no kind of uh&nbsp;&nbsp; you know if the person comes in with a sore left&nbsp; elbow that's a sure sign. There's no kind of sign&nbsp;&nbsp; or symptom like that that's going to automatically&nbsp; clue you off, but there's probably going to be&nbsp;&nbsp; some sort of dissociative disorder. And it's it's&nbsp; not so much that you go after it as the person&nbsp;&nbsp; starts giving you memories of, you know, it wasn't&nbsp; some stereotype satanic thing out in the woods.&nbsp;&nbsp; They start actually telling you uh something&nbsp; that sounds like medical research of some kind,&nbsp;&nbsp; experiments of some kind. It's either at a&nbsp; university, it's in a hospital, it's on a&nbsp;&nbsp; military base. So, I don't think it really is a&nbsp; bad plan to specifically start asking questions.&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to just wait and for the person to start&nbsp; describing that kind of stuff. And then if they&nbsp;&nbsp; start describing that kind of stuff, you just&nbsp; follow normal kind of therapy procedures where&nbsp;&nbsp; you just say, "Could you tell me a little bit&nbsp; more about that?" or I don't quite understand&nbsp;&nbsp; this or could you clarify that or what does that&nbsp; mean to you? Why is that important to you? How&nbsp;&nbsp; is that affecting you now? How does that tie into&nbsp; the problems that we're working on now? Mhm. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; you really just handle it using basic sensible&nbsp; therapy techniques that you wouldn't there's&nbsp;&nbsp; not a special set of strategies or techniques for&nbsp; mind control as such. And these people basically&nbsp;&nbsp; are human beings who have who've been hurt and&nbsp; have problems and you need to use same basic&nbsp;&nbsp; methods of therapy you would otherwise. So like&nbsp; if my personal conclusion is that probably the&nbsp;&nbsp; majority not almost for sure the vast majority of&nbsp; the satanic ritual abuse memories that I've heard&nbsp;&nbsp; which involves like hundreds and hundreds and&nbsp; hundreds and hundreds of babies being sacrificed&nbsp;&nbsp; vast majority of that can't actually be real. Some&nbsp; of it could be, but the techniques that I use and&nbsp;&nbsp; the strategies use in therapy for people who have&nbsp; those satanic ritual abuse memories are really&nbsp;&nbsp; pretty much identical to the same strategies for&nbsp; somebody who doesn't have those kind of memories.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the same applies to the military mind control&nbsp; people. The way I go at it, I use the same basic&nbsp;&nbsp; strategies, principles, and techniques. I don't&nbsp; really focus on the memories as the main problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mhm. In in your um opinion, do you think there is&nbsp; any links between um the accounts of ritual abuse&nbsp;&nbsp; and mind control experimentation? Uh nothing&nbsp; documented. The only the link is in the mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control experts. The people who are contractors&nbsp; for the CI and the military who understand the&nbsp;&nbsp; mind control techniques. Therefore, the military&nbsp; wants to tap into their expertise are also tend&nbsp;&nbsp; to people be people who are experts on mind&nbsp; control techniques of destructive cults. But&nbsp;&nbsp; a direct connection between cults and the&nbsp; military. The only uh book I know about&nbsp;&nbsp; that is a book called was Jonestown a CIA medical&nbsp; experiment written by a man named Michael Meyers,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Published by the Edwin Melon Press. and he&nbsp; pres presents a lot of pretty solid documentation&nbsp;&nbsp; that's not quite 100% conclusive that the CIA was&nbsp; heavily involved in Jonestown. Right. You've gone&nbsp;&nbsp; into a fair bit of detail in that in your your&nbsp; lecture that we've previously well one couple of&nbsp;&nbsp; just to give a little smattering of the kind of&nbsp; things. One example is that the people's temple&nbsp;&nbsp; which was run by Jim Stone Jim Jones was based in&nbsp; Yukaya, California which is north of San Francisco&nbsp;&nbsp; and then they moved down to the jungle in British&nbsp; Gana. And before I read this book, I never really&nbsp;&nbsp; thought about how did they go about choosing that&nbsp; site. M well it turns out that that site in the&nbsp;&nbsp; middle of the jungle in British Gana immediately&nbsp; before Jim Jones moved down there it was the site&nbsp;&nbsp; of the CIA shalom project which was a program for&nbsp; uh black exgring Bray u military people to train&nbsp;&nbsp; mercenaries for Angola and then there's a whole&nbsp; which obviously couldn't just be coincidence and&nbsp;&nbsp; then there's just a wealth of other detail&nbsp; like that connecting all kinds of things in Who in your sense who who do you think&nbsp; is behind all of this? Like the Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I'm sort of not really that much&nbsp; of a conspiracy theorist. I just think&nbsp;&nbsp; that it boils down to typical normal stuff&nbsp; that controls the rest of the world. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's got to do with military and the government&nbsp; and banks and helicopter sales and spying. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's it's no different from, you know, who runs&nbsp; radar or who runs jets or who runs anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a lot of it's just military contracting&nbsp; and it's government and it's a big business and&nbsp;&nbsp; Mhm. I don't I don't I'm not I don't personally&nbsp; subscribe to a special conspiracy theory like and&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think there's anyone at least the evidence&nbsp; I see I don't think there's any one little group&nbsp;&nbsp; of people who meet in some room you know somewhere&nbsp; at the Pentagon who are pulling all the strings on&nbsp;&nbsp; all this. I think it's much like the federal&nbsp; government. It's all kinds of little groups&nbsp;&nbsp; working at cross purposes and there's no one grand&nbsp; master design of any kind. Right. It's a network&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the old boys network. Uh yeah, old boys network&nbsp; is the way I describe it. And that's one reason&nbsp;&nbsp; I think of that is there doesn't have to be some&nbsp; kind of huge obviously there is a conspiracy in a&nbsp;&nbsp; sense and that it there's secret funding of mind&nbsp; control research and there's files and it's kept&nbsp;&nbsp; from the public. But in terms of the stuff that&nbsp; actually documented, there didn't have to be that&nbsp;&nbsp; huge a conspiracy because they just went ahead and&nbsp; published it in the medical literature anyway. The&nbsp;&nbsp; conspiracy is really the sort of old boys network.&nbsp; Everybody just looks the other way and knows that&nbsp;&nbsp; they're not supposed to comment on it kind of&nbsp; conspiracy. Mhm. It's not that anybody has to,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, send out a memo to every psychiatrist in&nbsp; North America saying keep this secret. Everybody&nbsp;&nbsp; just kind of looks the other way, steers around&nbsp; it, doesn't rock the boat, doesn't make waves.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've just got a couple more questions. Um I'm&nbsp; wondering uh how how a person undergoes the&nbsp;&nbsp; healing process that that have been um traumatized&nbsp; as a child or having participated um in the mind&nbsp;&nbsp; control experimentation. What what is the process&nbsp; for healing? Uh well some some people are probably&nbsp;&nbsp; too damaged to be able to heal. U so nobody&nbsp; should claim that they know how to help everybody.&nbsp;&nbsp; um or some people are damaged and they have the&nbsp; ability to heal, but I just not going to be able&nbsp;&nbsp; to describe how that should be done. So, they&nbsp; need to go to somebody else. But the people that&nbsp;&nbsp; we work with, m multiple personality, who I'll&nbsp; describe really traumatic childhoods. Um we don't&nbsp;&nbsp; really, like I mentioned just a few minutes ago,&nbsp; we don't really focus on the memories as such.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mhm. What we deal with is how these different&nbsp; personalities working together as a sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; inner family are getting along with each other and&nbsp; mostly not getting along with each other. And we&nbsp;&nbsp; try and get them to have more open communication&nbsp; and cooperation with each other, have more of a&nbsp;&nbsp; problem solving, strategizing kind of approach to&nbsp; life instead of all this conflict and fighting and&nbsp;&nbsp; amnesia. And then uh we work on building up more&nbsp; healthy, more flexible ways of coping with life.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's just in a nutshell to describe in&nbsp; detail is that's why my book is 400 pages long,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Takes quite a while. Um, and you you had&nbsp; mentioned that um a lot of in in in a particular&nbsp;&nbsp; test that you've done um a lot were able to&nbsp; integrate um these personalities back into a&nbsp;&nbsp; a kind of a hole. Is that is that really the goal&nbsp; of of the healing process or Well, it's the it's&nbsp;&nbsp; the goal in one sense to be this is we're just&nbsp; talking about people with multiple personality.&nbsp;&nbsp; vast majority of people who are involved in mind&nbsp; control experiments and the vast majority of&nbsp;&nbsp; people who are abused as children don't have&nbsp; multiple personality. I so I just specialize&nbsp;&nbsp; in that little subgroup which is only little you&nbsp; know small island in this whole sea of trauma but&nbsp;&nbsp; um the reason integration is the goal for them&nbsp; is basically that it's it's normal and desirable&nbsp;&nbsp; to be sort of an integrated human being and if&nbsp; you have a reasonably healthy happy childhood&nbsp;&nbsp; and adolescence and you have a reasonably&nbsp; healthy happy normal adulthood you're going&nbsp;&nbsp; to be integrated you're not going to have&nbsp; multiple personality. But the other reason&nbsp;&nbsp; is because it just works better. It's not that&nbsp; integration is the big goal in and of itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just that integration is a way to get&nbsp; to the goal of far far far far less symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp; uh much more happy settled state internally,&nbsp; much better quality of personal relationships,&nbsp;&nbsp; much better functioning in the workplace and&nbsp; huge reduction in the amount of health care and&nbsp;&nbsp; mental health care resources you need. Now, you&nbsp; mentioned that you are uh about to release a book&nbsp;&nbsp; um about mind control. What what specifically&nbsp; will the book deal with and and when will it&nbsp;&nbsp; uh do you expect it to be published? I'm just um&nbsp; I'm working just finished the second draft of the&nbsp;&nbsp; third draft of the book. So, it's been through&nbsp; three complete changes and now the final one&nbsp;&nbsp; I've done a pretty extensive rewrite of it and&nbsp; I've got a little bit more information. I'm just&nbsp;&nbsp; uh sort of digesting and waiting to come in&nbsp; from one of the universities that I got some&nbsp;&nbsp; information from. Um and then I'll probably go&nbsp; over it one more time kind of stylistically and&nbsp;&nbsp; then we'll see if we can get a publisher to bite&nbsp; on it. So, I'm hoping that it'll be out before&nbsp;&nbsp; the end of 97. And and what specifically are you&nbsp; are you dealing with in the book? Um, basically&nbsp;&nbsp; everything that we've been talking about, the main&nbsp; points are going to be that the US military and&nbsp;&nbsp; the CIA have been creating experimental multiple&nbsp; personality and that's an established fact because&nbsp;&nbsp; of the documentation. The extent that those people&nbsp; were used in operations is still not really fully&nbsp;&nbsp; known. uh the fact that you can create artificial&nbsp; multiple personality to me proves both that like I&nbsp;&nbsp; said earlier that it can be created artificially&nbsp; and also that it's likely to arise spontaneously&nbsp;&nbsp; and I go into that in a bunch of detail and then&nbsp; all this other crazy mind control research I use&nbsp;&nbsp; that to set the context to make it believable that&nbsp; multiple personality could been created by the&nbsp;&nbsp; military cuz if you just hear that out of nowhere&nbsp; it just seems too much to believe but when you&nbsp;&nbsp; have that whole context then you realize really&nbsp; just fits in nicely. And then the other part is to&nbsp;&nbsp; try and stimulate either a presidential commission&nbsp; or some sort of public inquiry into this and get&nbsp;&nbsp; the medical ethics of it really tightened up&nbsp; and make sure that this stuff is not ongoing,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? And get some recognition and compensation&nbsp; for the victims. That's basically the gist of the&nbsp;&nbsp; book. Do you have evidence of experimental brain&nbsp; implant surgery being done on epilepsy patients?&nbsp;&nbsp; Uh well there's two answers to that question.&nbsp; One is that all this documented brain electrode&nbsp;&nbsp; implant research that I described some of those&nbsp; patients actually had epilepsy and a whole bunch&nbsp;&nbsp; of them epilepsy was kind of a phony rationale&nbsp; for putting electrodes in. So when you read that&nbsp;&nbsp; literature a lot of the time they'll describe the&nbsp; patient as having epilepsy and then other times&nbsp;&nbsp; they uh actually put brain electrodes in just for&nbsp; either psychiatric reasons which were basically&nbsp;&nbsp; bogus reasons or purely experimental reasons&nbsp; but epilepsy is one of the rationale for putting&nbsp;&nbsp; brain electrodes in that's totally documented.&nbsp; And would these uh people be informed of that&nbsp;&nbsp; they were to receive brain implants or uh yeah&nbsp; but uh the sort of explanation for why that was&nbsp;&nbsp; scientifically justified and the informed consent&nbsp; procedure was really iffy. Yeah. And and what uh&nbsp;&nbsp; what literature is available uh on this subject?&nbsp; Uh there's a book called Violence in the Brain by&nbsp;&nbsp; uh Mark and published if I remember the year&nbsp; like 1970 or 72. it's a little bit hard to get&nbsp;&nbsp; or if you go into part of the problem is you&nbsp; can't do computerized searches of the medical&nbsp;&nbsp; literature before 1966. But if you go to the&nbsp; medical literature in the period 1955 to 1970&nbsp;&nbsp; and you look for publications by Robert Heath&nbsp; at Tlane University or Jose Delgado at Yale,&nbsp;&nbsp; you'll find those scattered around in the&nbsp; medical literature. Okay? Or you just do&nbsp;&nbsp; literature searches on brain electrode implants.&nbsp; Or then there's a huge literature on LSD.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just a matter of really going to the&nbsp; library and and searching around or in the&nbsp;&nbsp; book like I'll reference a lot of it. Well, I'd&nbsp; like to thank you very much, Dr. Colin Ross,&nbsp;&nbsp; for joining us on CKLN. It's been very&nbsp; illuminating talking to you and I I wish&nbsp;&nbsp; you all the best with your your new book. Yeah,&nbsp; my pleasure. Thanks for doing a series on this. We've been listening to an&nbsp; interview with Dr. Dr. Colin Ross,&nbsp;&nbsp; a Canadian psychiatrist working with&nbsp; dissociative identity disorder and&nbsp;&nbsp; has also documented the CIA military&nbsp; mind control experimental programs. Transcripts are available of the lecture that&nbsp; started off this series at the office of CKLN for&nbsp;&nbsp; $2. And the transcripts of this interview will&nbsp; be available in 2 to 3 weeks time at CKLN.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll be back next week with more in the&nbsp; mind control in Canada radio series on&nbsp;&nbsp; the international connection here on 88.1 Calen.
