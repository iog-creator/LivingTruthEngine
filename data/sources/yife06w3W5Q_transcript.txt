We take up your shield of&nbsp;&nbsp; faith for protection to block and destroy all&nbsp; the darts and threats thrown at us by the enemy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We put on the helmet of salvation to cover&nbsp; our minds and thoughts, reminding us that we&nbsp;&nbsp; are children of a mighty king. We are forgiven,&nbsp; set free, saved by the blood of Jesus. We take&nbsp;&nbsp; up the sword of the spirit, your living word&nbsp; that has the power to demolish strongholds&nbsp;&nbsp; and is sharper than any double-edged sword. We&nbsp; come to you, Lord, in prayer daily. In Jesus&nbsp;&nbsp; mighty name we pray. Amen. Amen. What's up, you&nbsp; guys? Welcome to the Imagination. I'm your host,&nbsp;&nbsp; Emma, and today I'm absolutely honored to&nbsp; introduce you all to satanic ritual abuse,&nbsp;&nbsp; MK Ultra Mind Control, covert experimentation,&nbsp; an organized abuse survivor, whistleblower,&nbsp;&nbsp; and overcomer, artist and painter, writer,&nbsp; songwriter, spiritual conduit, and healer,&nbsp;&nbsp; and a woman who transforms the unspeakable into&nbsp; a testament of the soul's unyielding sovereignty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnolia Dove, born into a lineage marked by&nbsp; survival and struggle. Magnolia's story began with&nbsp;&nbsp; roots in her mother's Holocaust survivor heritage&nbsp; and a rare AB positive bloodline, which made her a&nbsp;&nbsp; target immediately from birth. While the specifics&nbsp; of generational abuse remain partly shrouded,&nbsp;&nbsp; the echoes of trauma reverberated through her&nbsp; family. Her childhood spent in the loving yet&nbsp;&nbsp; dysfunctional embrace of her parents, an only&nbsp; child navigating her father's cocaine addiction,&nbsp;&nbsp; was marred by early dissociation, a survival&nbsp; mechanism that veiled her earliest memories.&nbsp;&nbsp; At age 5, the darkness descended fully, Magnolia&nbsp; became a target of ritual abuse and mind control.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ins snared by perpetrators tied to MK Ultra and&nbsp; Stargate projects, the sisters of Darkness Coven,&nbsp;&nbsp; and even her best friend's parents who were linked&nbsp; to the Warner Brothers and Hollywood circles. Her&nbsp;&nbsp; formative years were a battleground at private&nbsp; school and later in public schools. Magnolia&nbsp;&nbsp; was subjected to routine programming even as she&nbsp; excelled in her school's gate programs. The abuse&nbsp;&nbsp; was harrowing. satanic rituals where she was hung&nbsp; upside down, adrenalized blood being extracted,&nbsp;&nbsp; a shallow coffin burial with snakes and bugs,&nbsp; electroshock wands, starvation and padded rooms,&nbsp;&nbsp; bamboo shoots under her fingernails, and more&nbsp; as part of her brutal traumabased mind control&nbsp;&nbsp; programming. At Warner Brothers linked gatherings,&nbsp; she even endured child adult fetish parties,&nbsp;&nbsp; a grim echo of the movie Eyed Wise Shut.&nbsp; These horrors, layered with drug-induced&nbsp;&nbsp; programming and near-death experiences, sought to&nbsp; fracture her spirit. The abuse began to wne around&nbsp;&nbsp; age nine when key perpetrators, including&nbsp; her primary babysitter and sexual abuser,&nbsp;&nbsp; moved away. MK Ultra's grip loosened, though&nbsp; sporadic access for programming persisted.&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnolia buried these memories deep, blocking&nbsp; them out into adulthood, a survival strategy&nbsp;&nbsp; that allowed her to move forward until the past&nbsp; demanded reckoning. Just over a decade ago,&nbsp;&nbsp; a chilling memory of a perpetrator's Russian&nbsp; roulette threat unlocked a flood of memories&nbsp;&nbsp; linked to satanic ritual abuse. Over the next few&nbsp; years, the pieces coalesed, revealing the truth of&nbsp;&nbsp; her life that had been mentally compartmentalized.&nbsp; Magnolia's healing journey has been as fierce as&nbsp;&nbsp; her survival. Initially, her treatments offered&nbsp; little emotional support and trauma rehab provided&nbsp;&nbsp; only surface level understanding of her complex&nbsp; trauma and PTSD. Her true healing came through&nbsp;&nbsp; unconventional and holistic paths and a profound&nbsp; connection to Jesus Christ through deliverance.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, Magnolia stands as a whole, vibrant soul&nbsp; with many memories integrated, yet ever curious&nbsp;&nbsp; about the gaps in her story. Her decision to speak&nbsp; out is driven by a desire to provide hope, to fill&nbsp;&nbsp; in other survivors fragmented memories, and to&nbsp; reclaim her testimony. As a songwriter, painter,&nbsp;&nbsp; writer, and healer, she is a master at turning&nbsp; the painful into the beautiful into creations that&nbsp;&nbsp; resonate with ancient wisdom and urgent relevance.&nbsp; her work as a lifeline for those navigating the&nbsp;&nbsp; liinal space between trauma and transcendence.&nbsp; As a radiant vessel of Yeshua's divine light,&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnolia channels transformative healing messages&nbsp; and profound spiritual wisdom, guiding those&nbsp;&nbsp; yearning for restoration and truth through their&nbsp; deepest wounds. With unwavering devotion, she&nbsp;&nbsp; creates a sacred sanctuary for survivors of ritual&nbsp; abuse, SRRA, and mind control, offering services&nbsp;&nbsp; like deliverance, boundless compassion, and a path&nbsp; to wholeness and reintegration. Magnolia's voice&nbsp;&nbsp; is soft yet unshakable. Her art a bridge between&nbsp; worlds, her healing practice, a restoration of&nbsp;&nbsp; what was stolen. She is more than just a survivor.&nbsp; She is a warriorist and a thor proving that even&nbsp;&nbsp; the darkest experiences be transformed into&nbsp; light. Through her testimony, Magnolia invites&nbsp;&nbsp; others to reclaim their sovereignty, offering a&nbsp; message of hope. Quote, "The shadows may wound,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the spirit endures, and in its resilience, it&nbsp; creates beauty that cannot be erased."

My new friend, and the&nbsp; brightest light in a world of darkness, the one,&nbsp;&nbsp; the only Magnolia Dove. Magnolia, thank you so&nbsp; much for being here with us today. It's such&nbsp;&nbsp; an honor to have you on. Wow. Thank you so much.&nbsp; That was such an amazing introduction. It It made&nbsp;&nbsp; me emotional. You're so worthy of it. You deserve&nbsp; pages of an intro. Uh I'm that didn't go on for&nbsp;&nbsp; half the show. I could have said so much more&nbsp; about you. Um incredible. I am I was blown away&nbsp;&nbsp; by the harrowing details that you shared with your&nbsp; story. And then once we finally got to connect and&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard your voice, I was just aruck with how&nbsp; positive, with how upbeat, and I know it's not&nbsp;&nbsp; like that every single day, but just seeing the&nbsp; woman that you are today and what you've overcome&nbsp;&nbsp; and then understanding where you came from is just&nbsp; it's a miracle in itself. And I'm really thrilled&nbsp;&nbsp; that you've decided to come on here and share with&nbsp; others. I think you have a really big piece to the&nbsp;&nbsp; puzzle on so many different levels for people. you&nbsp; have a really comprehensive story that goes beyond&nbsp;&nbsp; um a lot of different uh scenarios, industries,&nbsp; socio and economic classes. I mean, there's just&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of different layers I think that people&nbsp; will be able to connect with and get puzzle&nbsp;&nbsp; pieces from, you know, and I think um you're&nbsp; a wonderful representative for this community,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I'm just really honored and proud of you&nbsp; for coming on and sharing your testimony for&nbsp;&nbsp; the first time like this. Wow. Thank you so much&nbsp; for having me. Um and that amazing introduction&nbsp;&nbsp; and you know we forget things about ourselves&nbsp; sometimes like it's you know a nice reminder you&nbsp;&nbsp; know when we're when we are with ourselves our&nbsp; our entire lives we you know we forget that we&nbsp;&nbsp; did really overcome all of that. it's easy to kind&nbsp; of go into like well what am I not doing or what&nbsp;&nbsp; could I be doing better and the crit you know the&nbsp; criticism or um so thank you it it's I do I also&nbsp;&nbsp; feel that it has you know watching other survivors&nbsp; come forward listening to other testimonies I've&nbsp;&nbsp; been you know just knowing wow my story kind of&nbsp; bridges to that and and because I experienced, you know, sort of different pockets of it. I Yes,&nbsp; I do feel that this could fill in gaps for people.&nbsp;&nbsp; It it definitely brings more clarity and&nbsp; understanding which is important for just&nbsp;&nbsp; all of us like a reckoning of of coming to terms&nbsp; with that this is really happening on this planet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um sometimes I think it's just so unbelievable&nbsp; for people to recognize. I couldn't agree more&nbsp;&nbsp; and people aren't wrong. It is. These are the most&nbsp; heinous crimes. It literally is too unbelievable&nbsp;&nbsp; and crazy sometimes to even wrap your mind around.&nbsp; Even when you do believe it, just hearing some of&nbsp;&nbsp; these things that that somebody like you has&nbsp; overcome and at such a young age, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and and these impossible scenarios and decisions&nbsp; and choices that you had to make as just a small&nbsp;&nbsp; child, you know, and it really is it's it's a&nbsp; huge shock to the world, but ultimately, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; this really is the reality that we're living in.&nbsp; And a lot of this stuff could be very preventable.&nbsp;&nbsp; It could be exposed, you know, and and it could&nbsp; have some sort of justice in the form of stopping&nbsp;&nbsp; it and helping survivors on the other end of it&nbsp; who are ignored and erased and silenced, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and and sharing these testimonies, I think, is a&nbsp; way to do that. It's a way to create validation,&nbsp;&nbsp; to create cooperation, and on the other side of&nbsp; that to to help other survivors who are just going&nbsp;&nbsp; through it, you know, know that they're not alone.&nbsp; and that other people have gone through things&nbsp;&nbsp; like they have and that they aren't crazy cuz of&nbsp; course you're going to think that you are. The&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff literally does. It sounds crazy to hear. I&nbsp; can't imagine remembering it and oh yeah, like oh&nbsp;&nbsp; my god that happened, you know. So of course, of&nbsp; course people have a hard time believing it, but&nbsp;&nbsp; it's still happening and we really have to help&nbsp; society understand that so they feel empowered&nbsp;&nbsp; and ready to to stop it, you know, and help expose&nbsp; it. And so it's really important what what you're&nbsp;&nbsp; doing. Um, I'm excited to talk about the work&nbsp; that you do. You actually work with survivors,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is amazing. And you have an incredible story&nbsp; from, you know, these the absolute most darkest,&nbsp;&nbsp; heinous things in the world to finding the divine&nbsp; light, you know, and and everything in between.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I'm excited to sort of go on this journey with&nbsp; you. Um, so I thought maybe if it's okay with you,&nbsp;&nbsp; we'd sort of paint the scene a little bit. So,&nbsp; you're you're an only child and so maybe if I&nbsp;&nbsp; know that that your family history is still a&nbsp; little bit spotty and we obviously want to keep&nbsp;&nbsp; privacy respected for your safety and uh you&nbsp; know and for protection. Um but do you want to&nbsp;&nbsp; share a little bit about your family background?&nbsp; Anything that you do know that might be important&nbsp;&nbsp; to your story and then we can start talking&nbsp; about your childhood after that. Yeah. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, I was born and raised in eastern Long Island&nbsp; in the Hamptons, in East Hampton. My family, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; my parents are from the Bronx. My mother's side&nbsp; is, so from my grandmother's side of my mother,&nbsp;&nbsp; she's a Holocaust survivor. So she came over from&nbsp; Hungary with her sister and actually nine of her&nbsp;&nbsp; brothers and sisters were killed allegedly in&nbsp; different concentration camps. And so my mother's&nbsp;&nbsp; mother came here really not knowing anyone,&nbsp; you know, having a few connections with family,&nbsp;&nbsp; her sister as one and some cousins and went to&nbsp; work in a bar in like a a beauty parlor and was&nbsp;&nbsp; raising my mother barely speaking English and&nbsp; um you know, a a very kind uh woman who was the&nbsp;&nbsp; landlord of my grandmother kind of took my mother&nbsp; in in a lot of ways. And I think that that's that&nbsp;&nbsp; had a a lot to do with my mother turning out good&nbsp; on many levels, even though this has happened&nbsp;&nbsp; uh to me. And I and I still have some questions&nbsp; to whether she was an MK Ultra survivor directly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um because of that, I'm not sure. my father's&nbsp; side are uh mostly Romanian and Russian. So&nbsp;&nbsp; we're originally on the Hungarian side. The origin&nbsp; is actually Transylvania on the border. So it's&nbsp;&nbsp; that like how I've kind of like come to terms with&nbsp; it is it's that that Roma psychic bloodline. you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, there's a lot of that um kind of heightened&nbsp; awareness in that bloodline. And um but as far as&nbsp;&nbsp; on my father's side, I really haven't been able&nbsp; to get much history. I know that he was in the&nbsp;&nbsp; army for a short period of time as a chef. And I&nbsp; think he was raised like pretty middle to upper&nbsp;&nbsp; middle class. And my mother was raised pretty poor&nbsp; uh lower class and is a self-made woman. But I was&nbsp;&nbsp; born in New York City in Mount Sinai Hospital&nbsp; and a C-section baby and really spent my whole&nbsp;&nbsp; childhood mostly in East Hampton, born and raised.&nbsp; And we did spend a few months out of the year in&nbsp;&nbsp; the Turks and Caos. They had a beach house there&nbsp; that they had when they first met they were like&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of traveling hippies and they decided to&nbsp; build a house there. And so we would go there&nbsp;&nbsp; for yeah a few months out of the year. I would&nbsp; do a little bit of schooling there. My schooling&nbsp;&nbsp; though was extremely spotty with the amount&nbsp; of schools I went to before the age of eight.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so your parents from what you know um they&nbsp; and one thing too that that you had mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp; which I thought was significant was your dad had&nbsp; addiction problems you know which which a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; times can be a symptom of trauma you know&nbsp; and and adults trying to contend with that.&nbsp;&nbsp; So even though you don't know for sure, it does&nbsp; sort of seem like even if your parents didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; go through what you did, maybe they had been&nbsp; victimized in some way throughout their life&nbsp;&nbsp; just with how the people that they were around and&nbsp; sort of some of the um some of the the symptoms&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe that they were showing a little bit that&nbsp; maybe you could notice now as an adult looking&nbsp;&nbsp; back that you didn't necessarily see as a child.&nbsp; Yes. Yeah, there was I I remember them having like&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of hippie artist kind of parties and I do&nbsp; remember my father holding me when I was little&nbsp;&nbsp; and and feeling that he was out of it, that&nbsp; he was in pain and because I'm such an empath,&nbsp;&nbsp; I I could feel that off of him. Um, and my mother&nbsp; admits that up until I think I was maybe up,&nbsp;&nbsp; she says up until I was four, but it could have&nbsp; gone on longer, but that he struggled and that at&nbsp;&nbsp; one point she was going to leave him if he didn't&nbsp; stop. And then he absolutely did stop. Uh, and I&nbsp;&nbsp; also want to point out that one of my main sexual&nbsp; perpetrators is linked directly to my father with&nbsp;&nbsp; drugs. Whether he targeted my father because of&nbsp; the group, the babysitter. It was a a group of&nbsp;&nbsp; babysitters, three women, um that did daytime&nbsp; traffic us. And it's possible that that is his&nbsp;&nbsp; linked link to my father. Uh or but it's a it was&nbsp; a small community is my point. And they definitely&nbsp;&nbsp; were involved in drug use slash um distribution&nbsp; like drug dealing together. And I do have memories&nbsp;&nbsp; of being left with this man alone. Sorry, that's&nbsp; horrifying. Mhm. Looking back at your childhood,&nbsp;&nbsp; you do and people understand what we're talking&nbsp; about with layers and like different um sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; compartments of society in a sense that your story&nbsp; intertwines with and industries. when did maybe&nbsp;&nbsp; the first abuse or dysfunction start in in your&nbsp; life as a child? And maybe we can sort of unfold&nbsp;&nbsp; it in order as they um as these different people&nbsp; and these different industries and different&nbsp;&nbsp; um layers sort of start piling on each&nbsp; other. Okay. So, I mean it is hard to know the first abuse because it depends on what abuse we're talking about.&nbsp; Like the first time I was taken to a safe&nbsp;&nbsp; house I feel was very early. I feel like I&nbsp; was not preverbal but just verbal enough.&nbsp;&nbsp; four or five a as early as four or five where um I&nbsp; was taken all of the abuse really feels the way my&nbsp;&nbsp; memories had come up was because they came up and&nbsp; you know I had repressed them. the first memories&nbsp;&nbsp; that came up and sometimes I think the mind will&nbsp; show you the first almost screen memories that&nbsp;&nbsp; aren't maybe as bad or severe as others. So it's&nbsp; as your psyche can handle them. So, I did start to&nbsp;&nbsp; remember in 2010 that there was a man and I'm&nbsp; almost like, should I just say his name? Uh, his name was Bobby. And he he would sexually&nbsp; abuse me. He would sexually abuse his own family&nbsp;&nbsp; members, his stepdaughter and and biological&nbsp; son and stepson. And I was left alone with him.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was accessed by him at the babysitters&nbsp; who had had trafficked us during the day&nbsp;&nbsp; and were planning to sell my virginity&nbsp; because I witnessed that conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I witnessed a lot of things in that&nbsp; in that in that um trafficking circle.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a satanic cult, the Sisters&nbsp; of Darkness, and they were involved&nbsp;&nbsp; in trafficking for money-making purposes,&nbsp; obviously. And I remember being downstairs uh very late with this babysitter and we were&nbsp; my mother was late to pick me up and so she had&nbsp;&nbsp; me come down with her to fold laundry. And there&nbsp; was another woman over who was connected to her,&nbsp;&nbsp; also a neighborhood babysitter that would have&nbsp; these groups of kids over over to her house. And&nbsp;&nbsp; she was talking about the business of trafficking&nbsp; children and like talking her into it. And I&nbsp;&nbsp; just remember them speaking about like she was&nbsp; convincing this other babysitter to do this, that&nbsp;&nbsp; her husband wouldn't have to work three jobs, um&nbsp; that she has all of this access to children. And you know, it's hard to put a total timeline&nbsp; on it, but I believe within a few weeks of&nbsp;&nbsp; that is when a lot of this operation really&nbsp; started going. And sometimes it was someone,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, paying to watch a child get humiliated,&nbsp;&nbsp; like watch a child eat something off of&nbsp; the floor. Um, acting out sexually. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; just spending time alone with a child. sometimes&nbsp; putting on uh plays and entertaining adults. And then what became apparent was the spiritual&nbsp; component, the satanic element to this. And&nbsp;&nbsp; I have they used to kind of argue who got to be&nbsp; uh I guess what is it? Glenda the good witch of&nbsp;&nbsp; the of the Wizard of Oz, right? Is it? And I&nbsp; mean they were fullon witches and they were&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about the name of their coven which&nbsp; they ended up calling it Sisters of Darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I remember the conversation about&nbsp; they liked the band Sisters of Mercy.&nbsp;&nbsp; So like how about Sisters of Darkness?&nbsp; But it was very clear that there were&nbsp;&nbsp; people above them that were teaching these&nbsp; principles that they got to have their own&nbsp;&nbsp; like backyard coven but that they were not the&nbsp; higher upper echelons of this and but they did&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of torturous things and I like I have one&nbsp; memory where I was in their yard playing and the this woman, Alice, one of the women, came over&nbsp; to me and said, "We're going to play a game."&nbsp;&nbsp; And she strapped she put these like gravity&nbsp; boots on me of some some kind. Uh I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't even know what they were. and she picked&nbsp; me up by my feet and hung me off of something how&nbsp;&nbsp; I see it as it was like a a laundry tea that&nbsp; probably had like hooks and I was hung upside&nbsp;&nbsp; down and she said Jesus went through this and&nbsp; walked away and waited for me to get into a&nbsp;&nbsp; very panicked state and then came back over and I&nbsp; mean I was trying to get my head with, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; all the blood rushing to your head like that, it's&nbsp; really uncomfortable. And so I was trying to like&nbsp;&nbsp; bend my body up so I could get my head above&nbsp; my heart. And um and she came back and said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you scared? Are you panicked?" And I was&nbsp; like, "Yes, yes, please." Begging for them to&nbsp;&nbsp; get me down. And she just took a syringe off&nbsp; the back of my spine and took extracted blood,&nbsp;&nbsp; which I have come to understand that that's&nbsp; adrenalized blood. And I would watch these&nbsp;&nbsp; witches get high on it and talk about how amazing&nbsp; they felt. And they would say things like,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait till you've been, you know, I feel like&nbsp; I'm 18 again." And then like one of the others&nbsp;&nbsp; who was more experienced in it would would say,&nbsp; "Wait till you've been on this for a month." And I remember them um keeping what I think were&nbsp; likely child parts from how I remember it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course, you know, when we come up with&nbsp; these memories, when they these surface, like&nbsp;&nbsp; we're like, are am I crazy? Um, but I remember a&nbsp; conversation of, "How do we know that the blood&nbsp;&nbsp; isn't infected with AIDS?" It was the '8s. Um,&nbsp; and they were like, "Oh, Dr. So and so, like,&nbsp;&nbsp; I guess it was their network work doctor tests all&nbsp; the blood." Um, and they would I think they were&nbsp;&nbsp; eating like some kind of bone marrow. They also&nbsp; were while abusing children and myself, they were&nbsp;&nbsp; also training me and a select few of the kids,&nbsp; especially the ones they had the most access to.&nbsp;&nbsp; So yeah, I was like in training to be one&nbsp; of them in their and I was eventually then&nbsp;&nbsp; hazed into their coven and um that would be&nbsp; the day that they did the mock coffin burial which feels like one of my most extreme extreme&nbsp; extremely traumatic days. And so that was a long&nbsp;&nbsp; weekend where this babysitter, this main&nbsp; babysitter was was my parents were working&nbsp;&nbsp; and they were away. They used to do put on these&nbsp; like flea markets and antique shows and it was&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe a long weekend that they were leaving&nbsp; for work and this babysitter came to stay at my&nbsp;&nbsp; house which in my head I thought oh well she'll&nbsp; be she'll be more well behaved because it's my&nbsp;&nbsp; house and obviously that was not the case and&nbsp; she invited the coven over and there were some&nbsp;&nbsp; children there that I didn't know that were&nbsp; not a part of the normal play group and I've&nbsp;&nbsp; come to understand the term like expendable&nbsp; children and yeah and so there was this one&nbsp;&nbsp; boy Elijah and they he around my age and I was&nbsp; around age six and they had us play together.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were they were just um encouraging us to&nbsp; play and then they would throw out little terms&nbsp;&nbsp; like you guys are soulmates now, you guys&nbsp; are bonded. Um this is like your brother. And then they would flip the script the&nbsp; script. They they flipped the script on&nbsp;&nbsp; me and and they said, "Now you can either watch us&nbsp;&nbsp; torture him to death or you can kill&nbsp; him and put him out of his misery." And I didn't like either of those&nbsp; choices. And they said, "And if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp; comply with us. If you don't listen to what we&nbsp; tell you to do, we're going to kill your parents. And just a side note, I just want to say that&nbsp; during all these different abuse scenarios that&nbsp;&nbsp; happened, these people would use whatever worked&nbsp; in that moment. It was either sometimes it would&nbsp;&nbsp; be your family knows we're your real family,&nbsp; you know, like and because you're being abused,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're dissociating each and every um&nbsp; scenario. So, I did not like that option,&nbsp;&nbsp; but they actually started to physically abuse him&nbsp; in front of me. the men were doing this. There&nbsp;&nbsp; were men connected, one being uh one of my main&nbsp; perpetrators and they started to twist his like&nbsp;&nbsp; dislocate his arm and at a certain point he just&nbsp; screamed and said just get it over with to me. And what I remember was that we went down into&nbsp; the kitchen and got like a grapefruit and&nbsp;&nbsp; they placed an X on a grapefruit and they had&nbsp; me practice with a knife, like a stabbing. And I would say this is the most&nbsp; traumatic thing that that happened&nbsp;&nbsp; because it's the thing that&nbsp; shattered my soul the most. And this was when they had him lay down. They had a knife and they wrapped my hands around the knife&nbsp; and I actually couldn't do it. I was like, I can't&nbsp;&nbsp; even penetrate this. And they were even talking&nbsp; you have to penetrate the it's horrible to think,&nbsp;&nbsp; but you have to penetrate the like breast bone.&nbsp; I I didn't even have that strength. So they,&nbsp;&nbsp; how I'm remembering it is that two of the&nbsp; witches wrapped their hand around my hand&nbsp;&nbsp; and plunged the knife into this boy and I&nbsp; and there was blood and I screamed and was&nbsp;&nbsp; so like so fractured, so dissociated,&nbsp; screaming my head off and them saying,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now you could be implicated. Now you could&nbsp; go to jail for this if you tell anyone." And I&nbsp;&nbsp; remember just screaming and crying and saying,&nbsp; "You made me do it. You made me do this." and yeah, that was really soul shattering.&nbsp; And it was a part of an entire day of&nbsp;&nbsp; being hazed into the cult where they&nbsp; then did a ritual with they gave me,&nbsp;&nbsp; how I'm remembering it is like a tab. I believe&nbsp; it was a tab of LSD because I started to like trip&nbsp;&nbsp; out and they we picked an area in my yard that&nbsp; was already dug. It was like a mound that had&nbsp;&nbsp; it was sort of like a fresher construction site&nbsp; and they had brought in a childsized coffin. And because I was tripping, it's hard to&nbsp; know whether these were real trained&nbsp;&nbsp; snakes or not real. But they convinced&nbsp; me that I was in a coffin with snakes&nbsp;&nbsp; and insects and not to move or the&nbsp; snakes would bite. And they gave&nbsp;&nbsp; me some kind of a a mask that to me I&nbsp; affiliated with like a snorkel because, you know, well I affiliate it now with a snorkel.&nbsp; I used to go snorkeling in the Caribbean with my&nbsp;&nbsp; father and there was some kind of breathing device&nbsp; where I was able to breathe but I was enclosed in&nbsp;&nbsp; something and it was in the dirt that was apparent&nbsp; to me that there was a burying happening once they&nbsp;&nbsp; closed this and I was absolutely terrified. I&nbsp; was afraid that if I moved even like an inch&nbsp;&nbsp; that something was going to bite me. I was most&nbsp; afraid on an emotional level of that I would&nbsp;&nbsp; never make it out and that my parents would&nbsp; think that I ran away or was like kidnapped.&nbsp;&nbsp; So that was the biggest fear I would say was that&nbsp;&nbsp; they'll just never know what happened&nbsp; to me and the the heartbreak of that. And I would say that's when a lot of the LSD&nbsp; was kicking in and I was really able to connect on a deeper level spiritually and I heard&nbsp; a very low but firm feminine voice which&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm recognizing as what people call Gia like&nbsp; mother earth and or mother nature earth and&nbsp;&nbsp; she said even if you never make it out again&nbsp; I'll take you I'll take care of you and that's&nbsp;&nbsp; when I was able to just kind of like be in the&nbsp; moment and I started to shift my body a little&nbsp;&nbsp; and realized nothing was biting me and my&nbsp; consciousness elevated in that moment. So when the cult members pulled me out and I mean&nbsp; there was like I remember dirt in my mouth like&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember they were brushing me off. I had&nbsp; an actual vision of I guess I had seen Star&nbsp;&nbsp; Wars at that age and so I think it's R2-D2&nbsp; when he comes out of when he's in the desert.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got like a visual, you know, the mind will&nbsp; always give you these like visual pictures. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and they had water for me and they said, "You&nbsp; passed, you made it. you're in you're in the&nbsp;&nbsp; in the group and I just remember thinking I&nbsp; don't want to be in this group. Um and but at&nbsp;&nbsp; the same time I knew that these people were this&nbsp; was like small potatoes like I had just elevated&nbsp;&nbsp; my consciousness in that experience above what&nbsp; was happening truly. And I remember then I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about what about Elijah?" And they&nbsp; said, "It was all a show. It was all all&nbsp;&nbsp; smoke and mirrors." Um, the blood wasn't real.&nbsp; It was pig's blood, which they use in movies.&nbsp;&nbsp; They said all of these things which&nbsp; could have also been a trick. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think these this is how these people operate&nbsp; as well to just confuse you. Um so that you don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know what is real and what isn't. But after that&nbsp; is when they married me to to to to the devil,&nbsp;&nbsp; to Satan, Lucifer, and they had us drink from&nbsp; these metal goblets, and they had us do like a it was like a mini aisle marriage. But to confuse&nbsp; my memories, they had another child that had been&nbsp;&nbsp; there walk down the aisle with me. They had me&nbsp; walk down with my stuffed an my favorite stuffed&nbsp;&nbsp; animal. And then they did the real like satanic&nbsp; ritual marriage. And why they do that is so that&nbsp;&nbsp; when your memories come up when you actually, you&nbsp; know, start to really like unravel this stuff,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's so confusing because they took a&nbsp; memory and layered it three times. And yeah, and that's a lot of work just um going into&nbsp; therapy and starting to unravel these things and&nbsp;&nbsp; figuring fig figuring out what's real, what was&nbsp; imaginary, what was a threat that was projected&nbsp;&nbsp; onto you that you envisioned in fear that's&nbsp; not actually a memory of what happened. Those&nbsp;&nbsp; are things that, you know, I had to do a lot of&nbsp; work in in many years of therapy to decipher. And yeah, thank you for sharing that&nbsp; absolutely terrifying and horrific memory,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, three memories with us. I know&nbsp; that this stuff isn't easy to talk about.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that this is kind of your first&nbsp; time sharing it on a platform like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; um really very brave of you and very courageous.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that's such a pain point with&nbsp;&nbsp; this healing is survivors who grew up in unsafe&nbsp; environments like you reckoning with the fact that&nbsp;&nbsp; adults that should have been keeping them safe&nbsp; and that they thought were keeping them safe in&nbsp;&nbsp; their front personalities, you know, growing&nbsp; up um actually behind the scenes, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; perpetrating them and then also forcing these&nbsp; children from such a young age to perpetrate.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that is such a pain point for survivors to&nbsp; to heal from their guilt of of harming a a human,&nbsp;&nbsp; an animal, a child. Um but unfortunately that is&nbsp; a massive part of the programming and it serves&nbsp;&nbsp; multiple levels in itself from keeping you loyal&nbsp; because they they threaten you and say, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; things like how you said if if you don't&nbsp; do this, we're going to harm this person.&nbsp;&nbsp; um we're going to harm the you know your family&nbsp; or we're going to harm the person that uh we're&nbsp;&nbsp; asking you to hurt worse than if you just do it.&nbsp; And then on the other end they you know they give&nbsp;&nbsp; you these different memories of actually having&nbsp; the experience and then they gaslight you with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; No, it wasn't real. You know, there's all these&nbsp; different levels of programming that create such&nbsp;&nbsp; a plethora of emotions of of anger, of confusion,&nbsp; of sadness, of just deep, you know, conflict. And&nbsp;&nbsp; it can create, you know, a lot of loyal parts,&nbsp; too. Um, which obviously dissociation, which I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; grateful that you talked about because that's&nbsp; obviously the the the means to an end of all of&nbsp;&nbsp; this is dissociation and creating identities that&nbsp; can, you know, hold these secrets in in different&nbsp;&nbsp; compartments. And, you know, when when they do&nbsp; these horrific things, you know, they're confident&nbsp;&nbsp; that you're not going to remember and that if you&nbsp; do, it's going to be so confusing. And I mean just&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to comprehend, you know, being six years&nbsp; old and being handed that decision, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; adults who were put in the same position if they&nbsp; were randomly, you know, let's just say kidnapped&nbsp;&nbsp; or taken somewhere and somebody said, "Here's&nbsp; your choice. You can hurt this person in this&nbsp;&nbsp; way or we're going to hurt them this way and it's&nbsp; going to be even worse. You might as well just do&nbsp;&nbsp; it." You know, I don't know a single adult that&nbsp; that wouldn't just break and shatter. And so to&nbsp;&nbsp; think about these impossible choices that they&nbsp; put on little children to make and then make them&nbsp;&nbsp; feel guilty. They threaten them. Like you said,&nbsp; you're on drugs, so you're already, you know, sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of seeing the world in in a very different way.&nbsp; Um, you know, which which can be terrifying, too.&nbsp;&nbsp; um being on a a drug like LSD where it really&nbsp; distorts your reality to begin with, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and yes, I just it's amazing, you know, the work&nbsp; that you and others have done to make sense of all&nbsp;&nbsp; of this because I'm sure even sharing it with a&nbsp; therapist can be very vulnerable for many reasons,&nbsp;&nbsp; especially not knowing if either a they'll&nbsp; be traumatized and say, "I can't work with&nbsp;&nbsp; this or if they won't believe you, you know,&nbsp; and and it takes such courage to actually talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about this and I'm grateful that you did because&nbsp; there's other survivors on the other side of the&nbsp;&nbsp; screen. There's people even if they didn't&nbsp; have something that extreme happen to them,&nbsp;&nbsp; we all carry guilt in some way and we look at it&nbsp; from one perspective that like I should have done&nbsp;&nbsp; something that's my fault, you know, and there's&nbsp; a lot more to things that that happen because of&nbsp;&nbsp; other people that make us carry guilt. And when&nbsp; we can take that guilt and make sense of it,&nbsp;&nbsp; take the shame off our own shoulders and sort of&nbsp; put it where it belongs, realize what what we did&nbsp;&nbsp; and were forced to do, but then also realize, like&nbsp; you said, you had adults that had their hands over&nbsp;&nbsp; yours. They had you practice. Like there was a lot&nbsp; that went into eventually forcing you to do this,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and being able to take that shame and&nbsp; say, "Okay, this was real. I did experience this.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is horrible and I'm going to heal from this.&nbsp; You know, I'm going to go through it and I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; going to make sense of it and face it and heal&nbsp; it, but I'm not going to carry the shame. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; going to put it where it belongs on them and I'm&nbsp; going to realize that I was a a child. I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; have a choice and it was an impossible choice.&nbsp; If you would have said no or if you would have&nbsp;&nbsp; somehow like completely, you know, defied it,&nbsp; they still would have made you do it. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; they would have they would have restrained&nbsp; you and made you do it or they would have,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, made you watch a worse scenario that&nbsp; they did to scare you, you know. Yes. Same. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's it's literally like a catch 22, like&nbsp; no matter what you do, you know, and so,&nbsp;&nbsp; and they're right, you know, a lot of times the&nbsp; situation is worse if the child doesn't comply.&nbsp;&nbsp; And they do that for a reason, too. They want you&nbsp; to be like, "All right, I'm just going to do this&nbsp;&nbsp; because I know what you're going to do is going&nbsp; to be worse." you know, and so that also creates a&nbsp;&nbsp; compliance in the child where it just breaks them&nbsp; down and they're like, there's no point in saying&nbsp;&nbsp; no because it's going to happen anyways. And you&nbsp; know, there's there's just so many different like&nbsp;&nbsp; layers and programming layers of programming that&nbsp; they put into this. And so I deeply appreciate you&nbsp;&nbsp; sharing cuz like I said, it's a it's a really&nbsp; really big struggle point in this community. It&nbsp;&nbsp; can be really hard to make sense of. But the more&nbsp; that we talk about these things, then we realize&nbsp;&nbsp; that we can take that shame gently off and put it&nbsp; where it belongs and then do the healing for the&nbsp;&nbsp; reckoning of what actually happened, you know,&nbsp; of being forced into an impossible situation,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and realizing that it wasn't your fault,&nbsp; but that it still was horrible. It still happened&nbsp;&nbsp; and that there healing that needs done, you&nbsp; know. So, thank you from the bottom of my&nbsp;&nbsp; heart for talking about these really hard things.&nbsp; Yes. Oh, thank you. Yes. And I want to say that&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean obviously why they use children is because&nbsp; children are pure and innocent and the closest to&nbsp;&nbsp; God. And these people who are beings of hatred and&nbsp; darkness like the lowest of the low consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp; They they get off on corrupting someone that is&nbsp; closest to God. And I have thought a lot about&nbsp;&nbsp; what was their purpose, what were they really&nbsp; getting from this other than, you know, I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched adults take vows that they were&nbsp; going to get certain things from the devil.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um they were promised things by the the the&nbsp; leader of the coven you know different things.&nbsp;&nbsp; one woman who couldn't get pregnant, wanted to&nbsp; be, you know, wanted to have another baby and&nbsp;&nbsp; just wealth and, you know, but on this other level&nbsp; of like, have you heard about redemption through&nbsp;&nbsp; sin? Have you heard about that? I find that&nbsp; to be really interesting when you look at it from a higher perspective of, you know,&nbsp; these beings that are clearly suffering so&nbsp;&nbsp; much that they would do these horrific&nbsp; acts. Um they're some a lot of them I&nbsp;&nbsp; believe are trying to redeem themselves&nbsp; through it's called redemption through&nbsp;&nbsp; sin. They think that if they [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] up&nbsp; so bad that somehow like God will have&nbsp;&nbsp; mercy on their soul. It really doesn't&nbsp; even make sense. But they're serving on a level of um like duality. They're they're&nbsp; serving the darkest of the dark. And in a way&nbsp;&nbsp; they are cat they're catalysts. But it's&nbsp; it's like thinking that if you mess up so&nbsp;&nbsp; badly like to your parents like maybe they'll&nbsp; take pity on you and like take you back. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; these people are so rejected or have rejected&nbsp; life so much that they're that they cannot&nbsp;&nbsp; source their own power from original source&nbsp; light creator you know holy mother creator&nbsp;&nbsp; um the source of all that is they are they have to&nbsp; take it from other people that's what they think. Um, I don't know if that fully makes sense, but&nbsp; it's just something that that comes to me like&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes when I think about like what what is&nbsp; the purpose of that? And and obviously a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; it there's nuances, but you know there's levels of&nbsp; power also. Some of them are just enjoying getting&nbsp;&nbsp; power over others. Some of them are, you know,&nbsp; really deep into occultism and they're gaining,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, power on the on the dark side. They're&nbsp; like they're working in the dark side and they're&nbsp;&nbsp; they're they're gaining power that way, which is&nbsp; not real power because with all of this that has&nbsp;&nbsp; happened to me. I mean, I actually have always had&nbsp; an angelic counsel connection. And I've I've seen&nbsp;&nbsp; so much of the sort of the realms of existence&nbsp; and and of humanity and the angelic realms. And when you know to go on the dark side of&nbsp; everything, it only goes to a certain level.&nbsp;&nbsp; like it it the the light is so much higher. Um&nbsp; you it's like um there's a ceiling of pretty low&nbsp;&nbsp; ceiling of consciousness is what I'm saying.&nbsp; Even if you graduate to a seemingly very high&nbsp;&nbsp; level in these like you know occult practices&nbsp; that are that are sourced from darkness. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're so that's a really great analogy for that&nbsp; cuz it's it's again an impossible thing for people&nbsp;&nbsp; to contend with which also makes people gaslight&nbsp; their own ability to believe in this stuff because&nbsp;&nbsp; it's so backwards from how somebody who's not&nbsp; a psychopath is. You know, unless you're a&nbsp;&nbsp; psychopath, unless you're a Satan worshipper and&nbsp; somebody that is just they live for that power,&nbsp;&nbsp; or so they're trained to live for that power and&nbsp; conditioned and mind controlled to, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; it can just seem so bizarre that there's people&nbsp; out there that are committing these crimes and&nbsp;&nbsp; then going to work the next day and they're just&nbsp; out there in society. And so I do get how people&nbsp;&nbsp; can just not be able to sit with it because it&nbsp; doesn't make sense. But at the same time, when&nbsp;&nbsp; we're looking at this, we do have to put on an&nbsp; impossible lens to look through of understanding&nbsp;&nbsp; psychopathy, of understanding narcissism, of&nbsp; understanding the complete and total domination of&nbsp;&nbsp; of your mind given up to, you know, other people.&nbsp; And then also to being so hungry for power and to&nbsp;&nbsp; having that be something that you're trained to&nbsp; just continue wanting and to do it all at all cost&nbsp;&nbsp; no matter what it is that you will do whatever&nbsp; it takes to get that power you know and then all&nbsp;&nbsp; the different layers under it the blackmailing&nbsp; that they do and you know dissociating you and&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean there's just so many different layers to&nbsp; it and I also appreciate too that you brought up&nbsp;&nbsp; why they use children you know and and you have&nbsp; some examples of this in your story where they&nbsp;&nbsp; know that children, especially children that they&nbsp; specifically breed or target that have different&nbsp;&nbsp; qualities that they're interested in, such as&nbsp; like how you said your bloodline has sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; heightened psychic abilities that run through&nbsp; it. And that's a big fascination for them for&nbsp;&nbsp; many reasons. But when we're looking at, you&nbsp; know, a ritualistic perspective, without their&nbsp;&nbsp; soul sort of being intact, without them having a&nbsp; connection, like you said, to the divine light,&nbsp;&nbsp; when they're shut off to that because they're&nbsp; vibrating on an opposite frequency, they can't&nbsp;&nbsp; connect to these beings that they want power from.&nbsp; And they have to use, like you said, a child, some&nbsp;&nbsp; something that is connected to it in order to have&nbsp; like that conduit. And so a lot of these children,&nbsp;&nbsp; they're grooming to to further enhance their&nbsp; psychic abilities, which your story exemplifies&nbsp;&nbsp; um you know, with with some of the things that&nbsp; you were recognized for. Um but you really see,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, how these dynamics make sense&nbsp; to these people because of who they are,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is different and pretty much opposite of&nbsp; how, you know, a person in normal society is. But&nbsp;&nbsp; that does make total sense what you're saying,&nbsp; you know, and maybe we could talk a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp; about that since we're sort of talking about the&nbsp; the satanic side, you know, a little bit about&nbsp;&nbsp; some of the ways that you were recognized and&nbsp; used for your own spiritual gifts that you have,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, which is kind of another sad point in&nbsp; this cuz a lot of you are born with these really&nbsp;&nbsp; extraordinary spiritual gifts, you know, and&nbsp; luckily a lot of you now that get out are using&nbsp;&nbsp; them the ways that God intended you to. But of&nbsp; course, these people, these psychopaths, they want&nbsp;&nbsp; to harness that for their own agendas and and use&nbsp; you as a conduit to use those gifts to help them,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, achieve power or to do evil or, you&nbsp; know, to help them with these very dark agendas.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, maybe you could touch on that a little bit&nbsp; with your story um and help bring some sense to&nbsp;&nbsp; it. Um but also sort of share because it this is&nbsp; kind of a big part too, the spiritual side of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, it really is. Um, well, I mean, as far back&nbsp; as I can remember, I was sensitive to spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first house we lived in was haunted. I&nbsp; remember watching spirits fly around me and&nbsp;&nbsp; when I was in the crib, you know, I was a seer&nbsp; always. and especially as a child which I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; see the spirits now but I I can more feel them&nbsp; and with um my connection with with Jesus with&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeshua and I can channel and and if I want&nbsp; to speak to other spirits I don't tend to&nbsp;&nbsp; I tend to stick with my original counsel which is&nbsp; angelic counsel and Yeshua um for safety reasons,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, but I always had that ability to to&nbsp; see the unseen world and to fly out of my body,&nbsp;&nbsp; which that would be up to up for debate whether&nbsp; I was taught to fly through the remote viewing&nbsp;&nbsp; uh programming that I received through&nbsp; Project Stargate. Um but yeah, I mean I I I was born on a date that has some heightened&nbsp; it has some celebrity names around it and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh even like one um yogic master uh is was born on&nbsp; that date. But my father was friends with this ma&nbsp;&nbsp; man named Howard and he worked with Ingo Swan&nbsp; who was head of the remote viewing department&nbsp;&nbsp; for the CIA remote viewing Ingo Swan and who&nbsp; also worked with um Russell Tar and Harold&nbsp;&nbsp; Hal Pudof is his name. And so those are people&nbsp; that I've met. When I look at photos of them,&nbsp;&nbsp; I I it's very familiar that I've worked with them.&nbsp; I remember working with them and I remember being&nbsp;&nbsp; trained by them. And you know they they would you&nbsp; know the what's explained to you as a child you&nbsp;&nbsp; know as um as an incentive to want to cooperate&nbsp; in certain ways even though they're going to force&nbsp;&nbsp; you to cooperate anyway. But like on the higher&nbsp; levels of that, you're told as a child like you're&nbsp;&nbsp; helping our government, you know, do things, get,&nbsp; you know, get rid of the bad people. It's like&nbsp;&nbsp; the you're helping be the hero. Um that's the&nbsp; programming with it. And so even when I wasn't and possibly even before I went&nbsp; to a safe house and that's hard&nbsp;&nbsp; to kind of chronologically like&nbsp; put on a timeline, but I remember um Howard would and these men that had a hand in&nbsp; my programming would talk to me about having a&nbsp;&nbsp; visual before going to sleep and then setting a&nbsp; target. And the visual would would be something&nbsp;&nbsp; that would help me to fly out of my body and then&nbsp; a landing spot to make sure that I could get back&nbsp;&nbsp; into my body. And so, you know, as a child, you&nbsp; pick something like a hot air balloon or a kite&nbsp;&nbsp; or an airplane. And I would choose the landing of&nbsp; my friend's bottom of his staircase. He just had a&nbsp;&nbsp; very cool house. And so, I picked the bottom of&nbsp; his stairs to land. And that's how I would give&nbsp;&nbsp; myself that focus of going back into my body&nbsp; after I would go out into essentially out into&nbsp;&nbsp; the ethers into the stars. And when they would&nbsp; pick a a practice target, you would your spirit&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially your consciousness is is viewing&nbsp; something from above um a and dropping in. So you&nbsp;&nbsp; you could be witnessing a conversation, you could&nbsp; be seeing um a building. It's um the way something&nbsp;&nbsp; is physically set up, a note, a conversation being&nbsp; had. But a lot of it obviously with a child was&nbsp;&nbsp; practice before you're likely doing the really&nbsp; serious uh like heavy heavy hitter heavy hitter&nbsp;&nbsp; work. But did that answer your question? Is that&nbsp; going in the That's absolutely yes. And and thank&nbsp;&nbsp; you for too for bringing up Stargate because&nbsp; the remote viewing part is very common with the&nbsp;&nbsp; MK Ultra circles as well and a gift that a lot of&nbsp; these children um seem to naturally have which to&nbsp;&nbsp; my understanding something like remote viewing&nbsp; and and all spiritual gifts. I think we all,&nbsp;&nbsp; no matter who you are, you have you can tap&nbsp; into them. But, you know, they they recognize&nbsp;&nbsp; that some of these children have the ability to&nbsp; do it better or more naturally. And so then they&nbsp;&nbsp; they continue to refine the child in it. Just&nbsp; like how another child might go to, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; soccer practice every day. with you. Instead of&nbsp; going to a soccer practice, they're training you&nbsp;&nbsp; on this and and you know, um, having you practice&nbsp; it and refine it for them to be able to use later&nbsp;&nbsp; on in your life whenever you're, you know, of&nbsp; course they're using it then, but they, like you&nbsp;&nbsp; said, they're training you whenever you're young&nbsp; to use you in a more serious manner as you get&nbsp;&nbsp; better at it through time. Yes. Yes. Exactly.&nbsp; And and there's, you know, with that obviously especially when you're in their in their&nbsp; direct care in like a safe house where&nbsp;&nbsp; the training is going really strong,&nbsp; there is so much pressure and torture&nbsp;&nbsp; um being which it which honestly I I mean, it's&nbsp; not necessary to do that. If you think about a&nbsp;&nbsp; child and how open a child is and and especially&nbsp; like a good naturatured a a a goodnatured child um&nbsp;&nbsp; like we listened. We didn't need to be, you know,&nbsp; electroshocked to participate in the exercise.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's the part to me that is just baffling. But&nbsp; it's obviously a big part of that is to make the&nbsp;&nbsp; child forget and to dissociate into specific&nbsp; fragments of personalities. And you know the the first memory that I have of being&nbsp; taken to a safe house, I actually remember&nbsp;&nbsp; my family being threatened and there were two&nbsp; men there and I don't know if they had a gun&nbsp;&nbsp; or said they had a gun, But I was essentially I&nbsp; remember my mother begging them not to take me&nbsp;&nbsp; and them giving her the choice of either we&nbsp; will take out your whole family or you will&nbsp;&nbsp; allow us access to your child. we won't hurt a&nbsp; hair on her head and we'll bring her back. And I was literally put in I was picked up with&nbsp; my legs dangling over this man's arms. I&nbsp;&nbsp; remember what he was wearing, like part of it at&nbsp; least. Um it was like a yellow like peak kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; um collared shirt like cotton shirt and a members&nbsp; only jacket. Um that used to trigger me when I&nbsp;&nbsp; would see that. Um, and and I was brought into&nbsp; this, how I remember it, as like an openseated black Cadillac with tinted&nbsp; windows and leather seats,&nbsp;&nbsp; open seating. And I just was put in the in the&nbsp; car. And I remember like crawling around the&nbsp;&nbsp; back and looking up. I'd never seen windows&nbsp; like that before. and one of the men saying,&nbsp;&nbsp; "See, you can see out, but no one can see&nbsp; in." And we went on a very long drive,&nbsp;&nbsp; which I've kind of tracked it. It may have been&nbsp; a safe house in Pittsburgh. I'm not sure of all&nbsp;&nbsp; my locations. Um, and I don't know how many&nbsp; times I was brought into a safe house, but I was brought into a facility where there were other&nbsp; children like me and around my age and put into&nbsp;&nbsp; these exercise training rooms. And I remember like&nbsp; one of the one of the things that really stands&nbsp;&nbsp; out to me was a boy that they put me in front of&nbsp; and there was a um a female I guess I would call&nbsp;&nbsp; her like a psychologist or she was a trainer&nbsp; but it felt like she was like a therapist. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and she had like a gentle nature to her and she&nbsp; had me hold palm to palm with this boy and said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, no speaking. Let him show you his most&nbsp; impactful experience." And somehow I guess he&nbsp;&nbsp; would tell something to her and she would have&nbsp; note of what he was projecting to me. And I saw&nbsp;&nbsp; that this boy had had a single mother, that she&nbsp; would make him mac and cheese and chocolate milk.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I saw the carpeting in the house and that he&nbsp; used to have long hair. And that in this program&nbsp;&nbsp; he was brought into that his head had been&nbsp; shaved. And I remember just and he was really&nbsp;&nbsp; sad that all his hair was gone and he missed&nbsp; his mother. And I remember like just saying,&nbsp;&nbsp; "You still look nice." And she was like, "Yes,&nbsp; you can tell him that he looks nice." And so&nbsp;&nbsp; there were like there were moments where there was&nbsp; emotional encouragement and then utter emotional&nbsp;&nbsp; torture. You know, build a safe place in your&nbsp; mind and draw it out. And I would draw these like&nbsp;&nbsp; heaven landscapes with a Pegasus and then that&nbsp; therapist would leave and a man would come in and&nbsp;&nbsp; say there is no safe place. and I would be like&nbsp; tortured. So, it was a lot of things like that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, there's one scenario where I was put&nbsp; into a mint green padded room and I mean&nbsp;&nbsp; padded floor to ceiling and I was starved and I&nbsp; don't know for how long but I was so hungry and&nbsp;&nbsp; I was aware that I was being watched from like an&nbsp; observational deck of sorts and there was also Alo&nbsp;&nbsp; one of those doors where it's a split door where&nbsp; someone can open to talk to you and some of the&nbsp;&nbsp; guards would sometimes like peek in and tease me&nbsp; and eat a pizza like in front of me and I would&nbsp;&nbsp; be begging to eat something. And at one point it&nbsp; was explained to me by one of the facilitators,&nbsp;&nbsp; we can't feed you. You need to be a&nbsp; clear channel for the session. Um, and I and they were watching me. I remember loud&nbsp; noises being played and I was throwing myself up&nbsp;&nbsp; against this padded wall and just like collapsing&nbsp; in utter just despair, frustration. Like I I I&nbsp;&nbsp; remember some kind again. I could be mixing&nbsp; memories with that one padded room incident, but&nbsp;&nbsp; for some reason my memories also show me a water&nbsp; boarding experience where I was like where my head&nbsp;&nbsp; just kept being like pushed into water as like a&nbsp; tor a form of torture. And at that those points,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, I feel like at high torture points, I really&nbsp; did connect with what I would what I would call&nbsp;&nbsp; God, like holy holy father energy. Like at one&nbsp; point I I saw him going through it with me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, so you know, and I had a lot of those angelic&nbsp; intervention moments. I have I I had a near-death&nbsp;&nbsp; during either that experience or at the safe house&nbsp; in that experience because they were doing so much&nbsp;&nbsp; um electroshock and things that were bringing&nbsp; me to near death. Um, and so I did have one&nbsp;&nbsp; experience where, and it I probably have&nbsp; more than this that I'm not even remembering,&nbsp;&nbsp; but the one that I really remember is um waking&nbsp; up on like heaven's floor essentially. And there&nbsp;&nbsp; were angelic beings standing over me and and I&nbsp; just said I don't want to go back there. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp; some like mystical things there where um like&nbsp; a pogo stick in heaven goes a lot higher than&nbsp;&nbsp; one on regular 3D earth. Um, I mean they they let&nbsp; me play like I was like riding the horses and the&nbsp;&nbsp; Pegasus and you know there's like that stuff is&nbsp; those are creatures of heaven and I was then taken&nbsp;&nbsp; to I believe there's different realms of heaven&nbsp; according to consciousness but um I was brought by&nbsp;&nbsp; these two angels to a gate where there was a being&nbsp; there and I was afraid to even like speak but it&nbsp;&nbsp; was saying let her speak and I said I don't want&nbsp; to go back and the answer I got was the choice&nbsp;&nbsp; is ultimately up to you but you would be missed&nbsp; back there there are many people who would miss&nbsp;&nbsp; you and there's a calling for you to fulfill like&nbsp; you wouldn't finish that. Um, and I just remember&nbsp;&nbsp; making that, you know, I was I've always been&nbsp; like one of those reluctant empaths like like&nbsp;&nbsp; uh I guess I have to go back kind of like you&nbsp; know, you know, you have to do the right thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I was told to um by this being at these like&nbsp; I I saw the pearly gates, you know, I was told&nbsp;&nbsp; show her around and then bring her back and the&nbsp; angels flew me into different realms. Um like what do you call them? I don't I'm for&nbsp; some reason at a loss for the word,&nbsp;&nbsp; but almost different etheric dimensions kind&nbsp; of. And then I was shown what I would call the&nbsp;&nbsp; realm of hell and I was flown through it and I&nbsp; actually got scared and they said, "Don't worry,&nbsp;&nbsp; like you're not condemned here." like they&nbsp; were showing me everything. And I saw this,&nbsp;&nbsp; it was like a circus, like a the darkest circus&nbsp; you could ever see. I saw all of these beings on so many levels just suffering and but there was&nbsp;&nbsp; like fire throwing and I mean&nbsp; it was like a really bad um what are they what is that festival called that&nbsp; like it was bizarre like a Burning Man type. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp; you. like a like a bad version of Burning Man.&nbsp; Like it was it was suffering souls and it was like everyone going through their own level of&nbsp; torment. It was condemned souls and it was&nbsp;&nbsp; also bizarre like I said like for the lost&nbsp; fire throwing and like just like a bizarre&nbsp;&nbsp; like a like weird like a David Lynch movie kind&nbsp; of stuff. Um, and yeah, I got scared and then&nbsp;&nbsp; they flew me out of there, but it was like a tour&nbsp; a tour of hell. And I believe it this this whole&nbsp;&nbsp; experience ended on a better note though, one of&nbsp; the higher realms. And then I just like was zipped&nbsp;&nbsp; back into my body. And I remember having like a&nbsp; renewed hope. It was an instantaneous renewed hope&nbsp;&nbsp; because obviously being tortured like that in a&nbsp; body that you can't get out of creates a a very&nbsp;&nbsp; visceral sense of hopelessness. So, but for some&nbsp; reason that whole experience gave me a new level&nbsp;&nbsp; of hope and I remember saying I I can do this.&nbsp; That's so profound. And it's so interesting too&nbsp;&nbsp; to hear like how spiritual you were from such&nbsp; a young age that you have these like really&nbsp;&nbsp; horrific things that are happening to you and&nbsp; your body's undergoing the most extreme stress,&nbsp;&nbsp; torture and trauma that a human could possibly be&nbsp; in right to the point like you said of pushing you&nbsp;&nbsp; to death or beyond you know and here you are able&nbsp; to tap whether it was through the LSD like how&nbsp;&nbsp; you were talking about um or just through your&nbsp; own consciousness. Yes. being able to like get&nbsp;&nbsp; yourself through what you were going through&nbsp; through leaving that moment and being able to&nbsp;&nbsp; climb sort of above where your consciousness was&nbsp; in that moment. It's really interesting hearing&nbsp;&nbsp; stories from you and others like that.&nbsp; You know, I feel like it's one thing to,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, have one of those experiences where, you&nbsp; know, somebody say drowns. You know, you hear of&nbsp;&nbsp; these stories sometimes where there's people that&nbsp; they do die for a moment and then they come back,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, or cardiac arrest. um people that have&nbsp; written about, you know, what's on the other side.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I also think that there's, you know, profound&nbsp; experiences that aren't talked about enough like&nbsp;&nbsp; on the brink of that, you know, before that&nbsp; actually happens, if it even does happen. Those&nbsp;&nbsp; moments going towards, you know, death or beyond,&nbsp; right before that, there's these really profound&nbsp;&nbsp; moments that people have with being able to, you&nbsp; know, sort of connect with something greater than&nbsp;&nbsp; them in order to hold on. And then how you, you&nbsp; know, your your body on in this physical plane&nbsp;&nbsp; that you and I are speaking in right now is being&nbsp; tortured to death. And here you are, you know, up&nbsp;&nbsp; in these heavenly realms making a decision to go&nbsp; back into your body. You know, that like brought&nbsp;&nbsp; me to tears hearing you say that, you know, a&nbsp; child again making these impossible decisions&nbsp;&nbsp; when you could have just been like, "No, you know&nbsp; what? I've I didn't this is not the empathy that&nbsp;&nbsp; I signed up for. Like, I'm done." that you you&nbsp; have like no safety around you in the moment that&nbsp;&nbsp; you have to go back in and you're still saying&nbsp; people will miss me. I have an impact to make.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm going to go back and do it despite what I'm&nbsp; what I'm going back into. You know, just very&nbsp;&nbsp; very profound. Yes. Yes. Yeah. because we don't.&nbsp; So I I just want to say like once the once the&nbsp;&nbsp; body and the ego are involved in this like because&nbsp; we are infinite beings our souls like we're good&nbsp;&nbsp; we're covered like I truly believe that like if&nbsp; you lead a good life you have a good spirit um you know we are divinely protected but when&nbsp; you are being subjected to such levels of&nbsp;&nbsp; darkness and torture. Like it's very hard for&nbsp; the ego identity and body to to deal with that.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's like and I've had to do because and I don't&nbsp; necessarily promote doing a lot of shadow work but&nbsp;&nbsp; in my healing I've had to acknowledge that my ego&nbsp; was really prepped to be thick at a certain point&nbsp;&nbsp; because of what I went through that I just on&nbsp; that level felt like I needed these these other&nbsp;&nbsp; ways to protect myself. So my ego almost like it's&nbsp; like when you have too much coverage or protection&nbsp;&nbsp; it starts to hurt. Like that's what happened to&nbsp; me. um where I and I've had to really strip those&nbsp;&nbsp; layers to like bring me back into becoming an&nbsp; open vessel, being an open heart, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; connecting again to others like because that stuff&nbsp; really closes you down. It's very challenging to&nbsp;&nbsp; this physical experience. Yes, 100%. I couldn't&nbsp; agree more. And one thing uh before I forget&nbsp;&nbsp; that I wanted to ask you about some of the&nbsp; memories that you were just talking about. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; when you say safe house, is that like a literal&nbsp; safe house or is this sort of a a private for&nbsp;&nbsp; better luck of words like programming center&nbsp; that is just utilized for children like you?&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I call it a safe house just because that's&nbsp; was a term that someone said to me when I was&nbsp;&nbsp; processing a lot of these memories&nbsp; like that they're called safe houses,&nbsp;&nbsp; but and to me the safety is just for them to&nbsp; protect themselves like the perpetrators. Uh yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean it's government and I mean I don't I don't&nbsp; know like is it government and private? like it's&nbsp;&nbsp; for sure only highlevel access to these buildings.&nbsp; Um, yeah, they're facility. I mean, it was my word&nbsp;&nbsp; I was using for like a CIA facility and and like I&nbsp; was saying, I I was telling you before this about,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, likely a lot of your listeners&nbsp; know that the CIA all a lot of those files&nbsp;&nbsp; are out through the Freedom of Information Act,&nbsp; these MK Ultra files. And I found one of mine&nbsp;&nbsp; uh at least in a grouping where, you know,&nbsp; it talks about in 1984 25 psychic children&nbsp;&nbsp; were used in Project Stargate, you know, psychic&nbsp; testing um on these children. And I'm like, "Yep,&nbsp;&nbsp; that was me. I'm one of them." I wish I could&nbsp; find some of the others, you know? I wish I could&nbsp;&nbsp; really talk to some of the people I was down there&nbsp; with. Those memories are spotty as far as who I&nbsp;&nbsp; was around. It's it's you know I would say most of&nbsp; what I remember are the direct programming torture&nbsp;&nbsp; sess you know sessions that were done and I think&nbsp; we were kept quite isolated for a lot of the time and now also to go along with that Stargate is&nbsp; obviously sort of an extension of gifted and&nbsp;&nbsp; talented programs sort of in the same realm. Kind&nbsp; of a government scouting program. One is a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit more severe than the other. A lot of times um&nbsp; there's different layers of gifted and talented as&nbsp;&nbsp; well, but you were actually put in those programs&nbsp; as well in school. Um could you remember about&nbsp;&nbsp; that and um were you taken off property or what&nbsp; was the gifted and talented program like for you?&nbsp;&nbsp; So not I don't not a lot like as far as like&nbsp; so yes I was in gifted and talented up until&nbsp;&nbsp; a certain point and then I feel I was taken out&nbsp; of it. I actually at a certain point from all of&nbsp;&nbsp; this abuse like I developed learning issues,&nbsp; disabilities um because I was dissociating so&nbsp;&nbsp; badly, I would just my I would be reading in&nbsp; a group and my brain would dissociate. I could&nbsp;&nbsp; sometimes not even read the words. Um, and but&nbsp; yes, when so I changed schools three times before&nbsp;&nbsp; the age of eight and that's not counting the&nbsp; little bit of schooling I did in the Caribbean.&nbsp;&nbsp; That would be the school number four that I'm&nbsp; just like that was more just woven in and that&nbsp;&nbsp; was a very small group of kids and it was right on&nbsp; the beach and that was only like when my parents&nbsp;&nbsp; wanted their vacation for a month or two at a time&nbsp; and but first I was in a public school so kinder I&nbsp;&nbsp; think was one of the programs that was connected&nbsp; I don't know if you've looked into kinder&nbsp;&nbsp; And there's a lot of like known MK Ultra connected&nbsp; to that. That would have been like nursery school,&nbsp;&nbsp; kindergarten that was public. And then and&nbsp; like like a preschool. Then I was put I was&nbsp;&nbsp; in a public school where a lot of testing went&nbsp; on and I was in that like G&amp;T kind of thing. And&nbsp;&nbsp; I just remember really uncomfortable, strange&nbsp; testing going on and a lot of hearing tests up&nbsp;&nbsp; until I was nine. They would pull me out for those&nbsp; weird hearing tests with the beeping that are like&nbsp;&nbsp; so who knows what that fully was cuz I don't&nbsp; think it was just about testing your hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um but to me that's the least traumatizing of&nbsp; most of the things that happened. Um but but it's&nbsp;&nbsp; reinforcing you know um just in general public&nbsp; schools and I won't go too much off of off on this&nbsp;&nbsp; tangent but I believe all of us even the non like&nbsp; mainstream MK Ultra survivors like we were all&nbsp;&nbsp; traumatized by public schools municipal buildings&nbsp; with asbestous um like cleansing products that&nbsp;&nbsp; are just chemical and artificial like and just&nbsp; really unsaavory, you know, teaching tactics,&nbsp;&nbsp; insensitivity. Um but so yes at one school which&nbsp; was a school called Spring School which was public&nbsp;&nbsp; and that was my technically my kindergarten and my&nbsp; first grade. There was a lot of these weird tests,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of like testing my um like a lot of puzzles,&nbsp; a lot of like just oddly designed tests that I&nbsp;&nbsp; would be alone with one other facilitator doing&nbsp; these things to be placed. And then I spent 2&nbsp;&nbsp; years in a private school that I believe once&nbsp; I was really like in the program, once that was&nbsp;&nbsp; underway, they were paying for this. And there&nbsp; was a lot of talk about just my direction. Like&nbsp;&nbsp; it wasn't just teachers and my mom, you know,&nbsp; talking about, oh, she needs to learn more&nbsp;&nbsp; science. It was like two men that were had a hand&nbsp; in my education and the direction of it and would&nbsp;&nbsp; pull me out during this private school which was&nbsp; actually at a school school called Hampton Day&nbsp;&nbsp; School and we would go into the gymnasium which&nbsp; you know when it was not being used and they&nbsp;&nbsp; would do programming there and that's when there&nbsp; were also some Mason what I believe were Freemason&nbsp;&nbsp; um programming things going on as well. Like I&nbsp; just remember being told like do you want to be&nbsp;&nbsp; a brick in the house? Do you like prepare yourself&nbsp; to be built like a brick in the house? like they&nbsp;&nbsp; I was hazed into multiple like I remember talk&nbsp; of my main perpetrator him trying to convince my&nbsp;&nbsp; father that I would be that I should be a part of&nbsp; a rainbow girls program which is a Mason program.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think it's also connected to like the brownies&nbsp; and girl scouts and stuff. It's all that like&nbsp;&nbsp; extracurricular like let us guide your child to&nbsp; be a better citizen but it's programming. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; so I don't know if that answers your question.&nbsp; And also I don't have so many like G&amp;T memories,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I know that that's a part of it. And I had&nbsp; and I remember when I wasn't in it anymore. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; my one of my best friends like bragging that's&nbsp; why I'm in gifted and talented like you know&nbsp;&nbsp; like Yeah. It's interesting how these stories&nbsp; overlap so much and how many children who were&nbsp;&nbsp; in MK Ultra or related program Stargate were&nbsp; also coinciding with having this additional&nbsp;&nbsp; testing done in their regular day schools that&nbsp; they were going to on different levels. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; there were some stories I've heard where the&nbsp; the testing went into MK Ultra type experiments&nbsp;&nbsp; actually in the school program where other people&nbsp; had more experiences like you where those programs&nbsp;&nbsp; were maybe at a different facility where they&nbsp; would do the Stargate type remote viewing and&nbsp;&nbsp; then school was, you know, the the typical gate&nbsp; stuff, the headphones and the weird the weird&nbsp;&nbsp; uh scenarios that they'd have children&nbsp; figure out and and just like the the bizarre&nbsp;&nbsp; um kind of uh strategy games and things like that&nbsp; that they kids do. But it it's a commonality in&nbsp;&nbsp; this community that you know a lot of you for one&nbsp; have and were tested for high IQs and that you&nbsp;&nbsp; were put in those programs in one way or another.&nbsp; You know no matter what level it was a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; you you know were recognized even in school for&nbsp; having uh you know the high IQ and the propensity&nbsp;&nbsp; to you know maybe have psychic abilities and these&nbsp; different things that they were testing for there&nbsp;&nbsp; too. Yes. Yeah. And so what other locations&nbsp; were you taken to um for these experiments,&nbsp;&nbsp; for these, you know, abuses? Um I know Montalk&nbsp; is is near you. There's, you know, New York is&nbsp;&nbsp; it's kind of a hot spot whenever you there's not&nbsp; a ton of survivors out there talking about it,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it has been coming up more and more and&nbsp; and you realize that there is actually a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; to the state. So I'd be curious what else&nbsp; you could tell us about where you were at.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay. So, so where I'm from is just&nbsp; about 25 minutes from Montalk. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; I do believe that I was at the base. I am not sure&nbsp; how often, but I believe I was brought there. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I had more locations to to give because a&nbsp; lot of my programming also feels as if it were in&nbsp;&nbsp; my bedroom, in my own bedroom, which there was one&nbsp; deprogrammer I worked with in my healing journey&nbsp;&nbsp; who said that if these people were invested&nbsp; enough in me, in programming me, They could&nbsp;&nbsp; have recreated my bedroom in a safe house or in&nbsp; a facility. So that you know what I'm saying as&nbsp;&nbsp; but also it is very possible because I of what the&nbsp; things my parents knew about and like I said when&nbsp;&nbsp; I say they knew I mean parts of them were sub knew&nbsp; about this um they I could have been programmed in&nbsp;&nbsp; in my bedroom um a lot And but as far as montalk&nbsp; goes, I really only have one memory of likely&nbsp;&nbsp; being there and that is there was so there's there&nbsp; are two men that have written a book the montalk&nbsp;&nbsp; Project Chronicles and I believe that I've met&nbsp; Preston Nicholls who's now deceased and they wrote&nbsp;&nbsp; all these things about what went on in in Montalk&nbsp; and were connected to this project Philadelphia&nbsp;&nbsp; and Ma project you know this is like Camp Hero is&nbsp; the is the military base location and what I just&nbsp;&nbsp; remember is holding ing his hand and walking&nbsp; through this sliding. It looked like a photo&nbsp;&nbsp; booth. How how when you go in not a photo like&nbsp; a if you're like developing film that's a photo&nbsp;&nbsp; booth, right? No, that's not a photo booth. It's&nbsp; like a um sorry like a a dark room a a photography&nbsp;&nbsp; dark room. It looked like something like that&nbsp; where you're walking through one of these doors&nbsp;&nbsp; that that you have to like rotate and it's just&nbsp; yeah completely dark. And I just remember walking&nbsp;&nbsp; through with him and me asking essentially I&nbsp; believe that we did a time travel because I just&nbsp;&nbsp; remember saying like what day is it? What time&nbsp; is it? And he's like we'll get we'll get us back&nbsp;&nbsp; to the current time. Like where we're going it&nbsp; doesn't matter. and it was like we walked through&nbsp;&nbsp; something and that's all I really remember about&nbsp; that. It is possible that one of the locations in&nbsp;&nbsp; fact that I was in the programming, you know, I'm&nbsp; I really thought um like I said, Pittsburgh and&nbsp;&nbsp; that was sort of off of an intuition of someone&nbsp; else who w is a deprogrammer, a friend of mine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um I I know that we like had driven a long&nbsp; distance but it is possible that I was programmed&nbsp;&nbsp; there as well in Montalk a lot. And one other&nbsp; thing that I did see in one of these facilities is&nbsp;&nbsp; what I call a government created alien. And it was&nbsp; like a robot that was made to look like an alien,&nbsp;&nbsp; like a mechanical alien. And they were all&nbsp; over. I don't know how else to to to say&nbsp;&nbsp; it. It's like a standard like gray alien, but it&nbsp; was like wheeling on the floor like a robot. And I just remember like trying to talk to one of&nbsp; like it once and one of the facilitators coming&nbsp;&nbsp; in and yelling at it to leave and I felt I felt&nbsp; sorry for it. I mean that's how sensitive I was&nbsp;&nbsp; as well. Like whether it was a real being or not I&nbsp; I believe it was mechanical. And I've heard other um I've at least heard one one or so other&nbsp; testimonies where where someone has mentioned&nbsp;&nbsp; like the government created aliens type of you&nbsp; know for whatever purpose that is. I don't know. Do you remember? Um, I know that&nbsp; it doesn't seem like that it was&nbsp;&nbsp; something that you witnessed and were sort&nbsp; of walking by. It wasn't something you were&nbsp;&nbsp; involved in. Did you see them doing anything&nbsp; or anything that any uses that you could see&nbsp;&nbsp; um the government creating&nbsp; these for and to utilize for just data collection. That is the only&nbsp; thing that I feel I witnessed was to keep&nbsp;&nbsp; track of the progress in the sessions. Um to&nbsp; record everything to like Yeah. Interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mhm. That's that's what I witnessed as the main&nbsp; purpose. Thank you for sharing that. that might&nbsp;&nbsp; jog somebody's memory or maybe other people&nbsp; have, you know, seen something similar. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; another piece of your puzzle that I want to make&nbsp; sure that we talk about to sort of create all the&nbsp;&nbsp; different layers that you were accessed from.&nbsp; Um, so you had a neighbor and had a child that&nbsp;&nbsp; was one of your best friends and yes, it might&nbsp; have been your actual best friend growing up. you&nbsp;&nbsp; could share about that, but maybe you could&nbsp; talk a little bit about that family as well&nbsp;&nbsp; because that had a big part as well in your&nbsp; perpetration and sort of where you headed to. So, I'm actually just having a sip of water. Sure,&nbsp; absolutely. Please stay off cuz you know this does&nbsp;&nbsp; it jogs a lot and it your brain starts to get&nbsp; like woo um you're jogging a lot of things loose. my best friend who since I was 2 years old, our&nbsp; parents met in a supermarket where her father&nbsp;&nbsp; came up to my mother and said, "Oh, like I have a&nbsp; daughter about her age and that's how they became&nbsp;&nbsp; friends." Which of course makes me think that that&nbsp; could have even been a target. Who knows, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, but we became best friends. Um, like I even&nbsp; just remember the first time her coming over and&nbsp;&nbsp; um playing with me and the babysitter being left&nbsp; with us and we kept like opening the door. The cat&nbsp;&nbsp; was supposed to stay in a certain room and we kept&nbsp; opening it up like she kept putting a rubber band&nbsp;&nbsp; on the door to keep these French doors closed&nbsp; and we kept opening it and letting the cat in.&nbsp;&nbsp; and um and her family, she lived on&nbsp; at the highest point in Amaget. Um and her family lived next door to the Warner I mean the it was the family of&nbsp; Warner Brothers. If you look up if you look&nbsp;&nbsp; at who you know created Warner Brothers, it&nbsp; was the heir to the Warner Brothers and that&nbsp;&nbsp; family and we would get in her family would&nbsp; get invited to these sort of like suarees,&nbsp;&nbsp; tent parties, very fancy. They had&nbsp; a a large property and while I was&nbsp;&nbsp; at my friend's house having a we used&nbsp; to switch off sleepovers, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; different weekends and if I w was at their house,&nbsp; we went to these parties a few times and you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we would dress up. I would wear like a dress and&nbsp; tights and little like Mary Jane shoes and go and&nbsp;&nbsp; play with the other kids that were there. And&nbsp; the, you know, adults would be dressed up. And I mean, it was like not just like a tent that&nbsp; is um like a wedding party that has a a tent&nbsp;&nbsp; and there's grass inside. This was a tent&nbsp; that was decked out like internal, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; inside furniture. Fancy curtains like on the&nbsp; inside the velvet curtains that could be closed&nbsp;&nbsp; with like these luxurious rope ties, you know. Um,&nbsp; it it kind of look it started off like a normal&nbsp;&nbsp; party in a sense with a maybe like a a weird air&nbsp; around it. And then they would do something like light like um light flickering type of&nbsp; things. And there was a shift in energy&nbsp;&nbsp; and adults would put on these robes that really&nbsp; a lot of the robes looked I would say almost&nbsp;&nbsp; identical. I just remember like&nbsp; black sort of satiny silky robes and there would be teenage kids walking on like&nbsp; crawling on all fours serving on like a silver tray like orves&nbsp; on their back And us children would get masks put on our faces and so that&nbsp; we could not see who was doing what,&nbsp;&nbsp; but we were in the center of the circle. like&nbsp; we would they would have us line up. So we would&nbsp;&nbsp; be on the inner circle, the adults would be on&nbsp; the outer and it was like we were being passed&nbsp;&nbsp; around in these fetishes type of things. Um and I&nbsp; don't even have all of the memories of that. Um so whether there was a like any kind of penetration&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know but there w there&nbsp; is one thing that I did remember before that which was like a testing to see I&nbsp; won't get too into detail because it's just but&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially What they do is they can test&nbsp; a child with like an instrument to see to&nbsp;&nbsp; make sure that a child's not going to show&nbsp; signs of abuse or of penetration. It's like&nbsp;&nbsp; a it's like a gynecological tool. Um, and&nbsp; I mean these people are sophisticated and&nbsp;&nbsp; they understand it and whether it was filmed or&nbsp; not because there were celebrities there. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to go home and tell my mother like,&nbsp; "Oh, Sy Sales was at this party." And um,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's possible I met Jimmy Savile, although he&nbsp; ran in a more like, you know, UK circle. Like,&nbsp;&nbsp; there was access to a lot of these people. And&nbsp; it is possible it was filmed as blackmail. Um, I don't know all of that, but I know that we were essentially like I remember pin the tail on the&nbsp; donkey being played except it wasn't a p it wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp; like the it was for fetish purposes like to to&nbsp; to engage like adults and children interaction.&nbsp;&nbsp; interacting and touching um foot things&nbsp; happening like yeah um inappropriate&nbsp;&nbsp; absolutely not appropriate one of their films&nbsp; is used in MK Ultra it's one of the most famous&nbsp;&nbsp; um programming tools their movie along with like&nbsp; Alice in Wonderland, which is another very famous&nbsp;&nbsp; programming tool. Their movie is that famous. Some&nbsp; of the that family knows they've had trauma. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; that part is one of the hardest things&nbsp; for a survivor is to not be validated,&nbsp;&nbsp; to only be given clues. Um, for example, the the&nbsp; I have been validated on certain levels by Ingo&nbsp;&nbsp; Swan's friend who was my father's friend. I mean,&nbsp; he straight up has admitted to me that he worked&nbsp;&nbsp; with Ingo Swan and I have that in a what's up&nbsp; conversation like spelt out, but he did not admit&nbsp;&nbsp; to like that level of perpetration. So because&nbsp; these people don't want to be implicated. So that part for a survivor is one of&nbsp; the most brutal things. If you rely on having your memories corroborated by another&nbsp; human, that part is really hard, you know. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; especially if they're still active in whatever&nbsp; cult or coven that they're involved in, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and some people don't get memories back very&nbsp; young, if at all, you know, and if they do,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's easy for these cults a lot of times to&nbsp; reprogram them. So they sort of forget all&nbsp;&nbsp; over again or just are so scattered that they,&nbsp; you know, they're not able to piece it together&nbsp;&nbsp; as eloquently as you have, which is really sad,&nbsp; you know, because then this ends up like really&nbsp;&nbsp; breaking up families and friends and causing&nbsp; so much dysfunction on so many levels, whether&nbsp;&nbsp; consciously or not. You know, the rift of memory&nbsp; and and how it can unfold into a dysfunction of&nbsp;&nbsp; its own. you know, remembering what a life was&nbsp; like and all of a sudden you're losing friends&nbsp;&nbsp; and family and and you know, people around you for&nbsp; your awareness. It's very bizarre and confusing,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and and it's ultimately sad. It's like&nbsp; I wish everybody in these in these systems could&nbsp;&nbsp; come out the other side like you and want to be on&nbsp; the survivor side versus still being victimized,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know? And unfortunately, so rare&nbsp; that that happens where people regain&nbsp;&nbsp; consciousness and memory integration and it&nbsp; really is a miracle. And it's it's crazy to&nbsp;&nbsp; hear just all these different situations like&nbsp; living so many lives in one life. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; you wake up one day or I should say one day you&nbsp; go to sleep and you're aware that you lived one&nbsp;&nbsp; life that maybe wasn't perfect but it also wasn't&nbsp; horrible. You wake up the next day and you realize&nbsp;&nbsp; you were living 10 lives at once and one seemed&nbsp; okay and the other ones were, you know, absolutely&nbsp;&nbsp; horrific and you were around all these people that&nbsp; you didn't really realize had a part in abuse, you know, it's just got to be really a lot to&nbsp; contend with. It is. And um at a certain point&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I was going to live in a mental&nbsp; hospital for the rest of my life because&nbsp;&nbsp; I just did not know how I was ever going to&nbsp; put all the fractured pieces back together.&nbsp;&nbsp; and and it it left me pretty hopeless for a&nbsp; like a large chunk of time where I was just&nbsp;&nbsp; very much in a dysfunctional depressed and&nbsp; passively suicidal um you know mentality. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um it it definitely was I mean I had to do so many&nbsp; things on my healing journey and um I mean I would&nbsp;&nbsp; say the spiritual part you know connecting to&nbsp; to Jesus to Yeshua to um my angelic counsel&nbsp;&nbsp; plant medicine helped me a plant called ibogga&nbsp; helped me a lot. I mean, there were multiple&nbsp;&nbsp; things that that helped and just like doing that&nbsp; work on like putting myself back together and um yeah, I wish for others. It's just one of the hardest things to do, but it&nbsp; is possible. And it's even possible when you've&nbsp;&nbsp; been shattered into a million pieces because and I&nbsp; I'm going to venture to say that because I wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp; that cooperative. I I we didn't even like quite&nbsp; get into all of that, but I sort of like failed&nbsp;&nbsp; out of some of that project Stargate. I mean,&nbsp; they just kept accessing me and well, if she's&nbsp;&nbsp; not going to do that, we're going to test this on&nbsp; her. Like, they really tried to shatter me. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it didn't work. I mean, it did, but it&nbsp; didn't. And uh because the spirit is stronger&nbsp;&nbsp; um and our connection to a divine plan is stronger&nbsp; if we can all be so lucky to remember ours, you know, and get those original memories back.&nbsp; Not just of the abuse but of the connection to the&nbsp;&nbsp; ultimate source. Yes. You know, absolutely. Yes.&nbsp; And your story really does span so much. And I&nbsp;&nbsp; know we kind of covered the the groundwork on it.&nbsp; Yeah. And I wanted to say my friend's family also&nbsp;&nbsp; was doing Luciferian practices and was possibly&nbsp; even connected because her father used to wear&nbsp;&nbsp; a robe in the house with a um it had an emblem&nbsp; of a wolf. Uh sorry, a sheep unmasking to reveal&nbsp;&nbsp; a wolf. A wolf in sheep's clothes essentially&nbsp; was their emblem. That is Fabian society which&nbsp;&nbsp; is directly connected to the UK and communism.&nbsp; It's a and they're a pro pedophilia group. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; connected to um Harriet Harmon is the woman. So&nbsp; I've had to just like I said be my own detective&nbsp;&nbsp; looking up these things and figuring it out.&nbsp; But like if you follow, if you have the courage,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and the will to follow these leads,&nbsp; you will find it and figure it out. Whether the&nbsp;&nbsp; perpetrators ever admit to anything or not,&nbsp; like you will come to know your own story. Yeah. Amen to that. And what a miracle it is&nbsp; that you and others have gotten to a place&nbsp;&nbsp; where you can be so integrated through a memory&nbsp; perspective to to understand it even if you don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know every little thing. Just to have the pieces&nbsp; that you can start putting together and even if&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a couple missing pieces to understand&nbsp; what you went through. It's it can really set&nbsp;&nbsp; you on a path to healing and help you know help&nbsp; you regain control over your nervous system and&nbsp;&nbsp; how all those things initially feel whenever&nbsp; you start remembering them which can be really&nbsp;&nbsp; horrifying. Mhm. Oh yeah. Yeah. It can be really&nbsp; really scary. And when I first started to remember&nbsp;&nbsp; I nearly lost it. And I remember I called this&nbsp; one author I forget her name. Ellen Lectar, I&nbsp;&nbsp; think it was. She wrote a book, right? End ritual&nbsp; abuse, right? I called her in 2013 and was like,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh my god, I've been through this." And at that&nbsp; point, no one was really talking about it except&nbsp;&nbsp; for maybe Kathy O'Brien or, you know, there was&nbsp; a couple. Yeah. And she did not stay on the phone&nbsp;&nbsp; very long with me. So, I didn't understand even&nbsp; what I had stumbled upon fully. I just She said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't stay on the phone with you very&nbsp; long." Like, I wanted her to be my therapist&nbsp;&nbsp; immediately cuz that's the work she used to do.&nbsp; And before she was writing her books and she said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't do this work with one-on-one survivors&nbsp; anymore." And I said, "Oh, is it because it's&nbsp;&nbsp; too painful?" She said, "That's not why." and she&nbsp; she's like, "I can't stay too long on the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp; but" And she walked she said, "Just know&nbsp; everyone around you likely is involved&nbsp;&nbsp; in some way in the in in in this." And she's&nbsp; like, "You can do it. Like, you can do this."&nbsp;&nbsp; She kind of just gave me some encouragement,&nbsp; but I would It's utterly frightening. It is. And you have an incredible journey&nbsp; of healing and then on the other side of&nbsp;&nbsp; that becoming a healer. And I think it would be&nbsp; amazing to do a part two where we go into that&nbsp;&nbsp; part of your story. And you know, I'll obviously&nbsp; let if there's anything else that you wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp; cover today, we can talk about that. But one&nbsp; thing I really did want to talk about um maybe&nbsp;&nbsp; after we we close up, anything else that you&nbsp; wanted to share about those childhood years?&nbsp;&nbsp; You are a healer and I I want to spend a little&nbsp; bit of time sharing what it is that you do and&nbsp;&nbsp; how people can support you and ultimately hire&nbsp; you, you know, if your services are something&nbsp;&nbsp; that they're seeking right now because&nbsp; there isn't a ton of help out there. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, wanted to sort of pass that over to you&nbsp; if you wanted to talk about that or if there&nbsp;&nbsp; was some other things that you wanted to tie&nbsp; up with the other conversations that we had,&nbsp;&nbsp; feel free to go into it. Okay. Um, yeah, there&nbsp; was one other thing I did want to say. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; In connection to what we were just speaking of.&nbsp; Uh, oh, I I just wanted to encourage like surviv&nbsp;&nbsp; survivors who are uncovering their memories and it&nbsp; feels like the neverending like Pandora's box. Um, and you do feel like you're being bombarded&nbsp; not just with the memories but possible&nbsp;&nbsp; gangstalking or like where you feel there&nbsp; are real threats still like happening. I&nbsp;&nbsp; think a big key in this is to keep your&nbsp; vibration as high as you possibly can.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because that and really connect whether you&nbsp; believe in God or not or higher divinity&nbsp;&nbsp; source like connecting to your highest light&nbsp; like it brings you up. It elevates you and it's like these these things can't touch you&nbsp; anymore. And I just wanted to put that out there&nbsp;&nbsp; because I know on top of uncovering things&nbsp; and working on healing, unraveling really,&nbsp;&nbsp; really painful things that you're reliving&nbsp; um on top of being bombarded say still by&nbsp;&nbsp; perpetrators or that energy or feeling it's&nbsp; like a double whammy. And so I think like a&nbsp;&nbsp; real key is spiritual nourishment, keeping your&nbsp; vibration really high. There's obviously so many&nbsp;&nbsp; layers to that as well. I love that spiritual&nbsp; nourishment. That's a really great way to word&nbsp;&nbsp; that. Yeah. Yeah. And I wish I knew I had&nbsp; known all of that then because my healing&nbsp;&nbsp; journey was really bumpy in a lot of ways,&nbsp; especially in the beginning. And now look&nbsp;&nbsp; at you now. You're speaking on podcasts. You're&nbsp; helping others through their own trauma. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; what a turnaround you've made since&nbsp; remembering and taking action on your&nbsp;&nbsp; healing. It's really amazing to see you on the&nbsp; other side of this now. Thank you. Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. Yeah. I feel much more at peace and&nbsp; I've done a lot of healing and integration and um you know you had asked what what I do.&nbsp; So what services I have I mean I I am involved&nbsp;&nbsp; in the arts. I have done um a film production and&nbsp; I am a painter and a musician. Um but my healing&nbsp;&nbsp; work and I love helping other survivors and I do&nbsp; help other survivors and non-s survivors of you&nbsp;&nbsp; know SRRA and MK Ultra. It can be you know life is&nbsp; traumatic. Um, I work with people and I do inner&nbsp;&nbsp; child deliverance with with Jesus with Yeshua. So&nbsp; essentially I I connect with him and and Jesus is&nbsp;&nbsp; and was an ascended being who graduated and he&nbsp; went through as we know like a slew of trauma.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I have been speaking with Jesus since I am a&nbsp; child. And he has manifested as plain as day in&nbsp;&nbsp; front of me and been speaking to me, wanting me to&nbsp; um spread his wisdom, which I've agreed to since&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a child. Um, and he has healed wounds on my&nbsp; on my skin. Um, like I cut myself once playing on&nbsp;&nbsp; my finger and he healed it. Um, he is a light&nbsp; worker, an ascended master being. And so what&nbsp;&nbsp; I like to do for other people is I like to relay&nbsp; messages. When people, you know, come to me with&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of their life situation, looking for certain&nbsp; guidance, I work with him for their guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't like to necessarily call it channeling&nbsp; because sometimes people affiliate that word,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, I'm a conduit of of him and my healing&nbsp; also is affiliated with and comes from him. It&nbsp;&nbsp; comes from the Holy Spirit and um that's what I&nbsp; do. So I work with people energetically through&nbsp;&nbsp; him and with messages from him and and I also&nbsp; you know there are it's it is up to us we&nbsp;&nbsp; can you know god can heal us instantaneously&nbsp; but because we're on this human path journey you know we want to do our own work too&nbsp; and So the inner child deliverance work,&nbsp;&nbsp; I really like that because the the child&nbsp; ego parts that got wounded can be healed&nbsp;&nbsp; with his guidance. And so I do that to heal the&nbsp; wounded parts with people, with clients. That's&nbsp;&nbsp; so beautiful. again. Look how cool that is that&nbsp; you know you were the one seeking help and now&nbsp;&nbsp; you're able to help other people through their own&nbsp; journey after all the healing that you did. Like&nbsp;&nbsp; what a cool gift to give to the world. I know&nbsp; that there there are a lot of survivors. I get&nbsp;&nbsp; emails pretty frequently from survivors looking&nbsp; for recommendations for healing, for therapy,&nbsp;&nbsp; um for people that can, you know, help deliver&nbsp; them. There's so many things that survivors need&nbsp;&nbsp; in their journey. If somebody heard what you just&nbsp; said and it resonates with them and they're like,&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's exactly what I need. I really want to&nbsp; reach out to her. I want to work directly with&nbsp;&nbsp; a survivor. How can get in touch with you?"&nbsp; Um, so I just set up a new like anonymous&nbsp;&nbsp; uh Instagram and that is uh let's see.&nbsp; I'm like, "Okay, so we're Magnolia777 and they can DM me and then I&nbsp; I did set up an email with that&nbsp;&nbsp; as well and that is magnolia trinity@gmail.com. like my phone number can be provided as well&nbsp; through you if anyone reaches out directly to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could you could give my number to like say&nbsp; someone who is looking to you know work with like&nbsp;&nbsp; do this kind of work. And I also just want to say&nbsp; I have done multiple deliverances through other&nbsp;&nbsp; deliverance coaches. So, I am a clean vessel.&nbsp; Um, I've had exorcisms. I've had exorcisms with&nbsp;&nbsp; um interrogation, which is like crazy. Uh,&nbsp; I mean, you know, where each any part of you&nbsp;&nbsp; that is still like giving to a certain energy or&nbsp; entity is being like really pressed and and and&nbsp;&nbsp; brought into into line in line. Um, I don't work&nbsp; that harshly. I find that can get a little too&nbsp;&nbsp; cerebral. I really work with Holy Spirit. It's&nbsp; very gentle and loving and pure. Yeah. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; I definitely encourage people to reach out&nbsp; and support. Um, one of the easiest things&nbsp;&nbsp; if you're not seeking her guidance through a&nbsp; healing. Um, one of the easiest things that&nbsp;&nbsp; that the rest of you can do is go follow her&nbsp; on social media and just support her content,&nbsp;&nbsp; share it on your stories, connect with it, comment&nbsp; on it. You know, survivors often get really buried&nbsp;&nbsp; in the mix of the algorithm. And it's sad because&nbsp; other people speak over them who are not survivors&nbsp;&nbsp; and who are not helping survivors or even engaging&nbsp; with them or giving them credit. They're basically&nbsp;&nbsp; taking their information, profiting off of it, um,&nbsp; pretending that it's their own research, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and and then these survivors just get sort of&nbsp; tossed to the wind. Their information is being&nbsp;&nbsp; exploited again, you know, their experiences and&nbsp; uh, society continues to look away from them. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the easiest things that we can do as&nbsp; a society to support survivors is if they're&nbsp;&nbsp; on social media to just follow them. It's free,&nbsp; it's easy, and so is sharing their content. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; for the rest of you who who aren't going to&nbsp; contact her, or aren't looking for healing, I'll&nbsp;&nbsp; have her Instagram below and encourage you guys to&nbsp; just go support as an ally, as an advocate, as a&nbsp;&nbsp; support system. Um, help engage with her content,&nbsp; get it seen by more people. Um, and of course, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; share her links, her email, share her social media&nbsp; with any survivors you might know if you are also,&nbsp;&nbsp; uh, working with them or if you are&nbsp; somebody that connects with them online.&nbsp;&nbsp; and follows them. If you see somebody&nbsp; struggling who might need a helping hand,&nbsp;&nbsp; um you have another resource now. So, please&nbsp; help share her information to anybody who might&nbsp;&nbsp; be in need as well in your life. Um those things&nbsp; work absolute wonders to help support survivors&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's free. You know, it's a really easy thing&nbsp; that we can all collectively do together. Um and I&nbsp;&nbsp; really appreciate Magnolia all the work that you&nbsp; have done. Again, it's it's just so neat seeing&nbsp;&nbsp; you on the other side of here and impossible to&nbsp; imagine where you came from, knowing where you are&nbsp;&nbsp; right now. You know, it's it's like the darkest of&nbsp; the dark to the absolute brightest light. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp; amazing the journey that you've gone on. I feel&nbsp; like you're still just beginning and just getting&nbsp;&nbsp; started on it even though you've been going for&nbsp; so long, but you've learned so much, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and and over a decade of of healing and trying out&nbsp; different things. You know, what a resource you&nbsp;&nbsp; can be now to people who need guidance and advice&nbsp; through their hardest times. And you've gotten to&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of see a big evolution of this movement where&nbsp; even, you know, 2013 hardly anybody was talking&nbsp;&nbsp; about this stuff besides maybe Kathy O'Brien and&nbsp; a couple other survivors that you could find if&nbsp;&nbsp; you really dug. You know, now there's a lot more&nbsp; voices chiming in and you know, with all this with&nbsp;&nbsp; all this time under your belt that you've gotten&nbsp; to spend trying all these different things and&nbsp;&nbsp; learning and seeing the evolution. You know,&nbsp; it's great having you on the forefront now as a&nbsp;&nbsp; public speaker. you know, getting to share all of&nbsp; this with people and providing your puzzle piece&nbsp;&nbsp; now after you got so many puzzle pieces from&nbsp; other people who helped you along the way. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; congratulations on all levels. Thank you so much.&nbsp; I'm really going to I'm working on receiving like&nbsp;&nbsp; taking that in and like really just taking it in&nbsp; as a truth. You know, it's sometimes hard to be&nbsp;&nbsp; like, "Wow, I really have done that." So, thank&nbsp; you. Um, you're so welcome. Yeah, thank you. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um, thank you so much for giving me the platform&nbsp; to share this and um, yeah, it's my honor. We all&nbsp;&nbsp; need to know this stuff and face it even if it's&nbsp; uncomfortable to listen to. And yes, and it's&nbsp;&nbsp; well, it has to stop. I mean, it it's this is not&nbsp; this is like a monstrous cycle on the planet that&nbsp;&nbsp; through awareness like it has to stop. These&nbsp; like like these bloodlines have to heal. This&nbsp;&nbsp; is not the way. This is not the way to go,&nbsp; you know. Absolutely. I couldn't agree more&nbsp;&nbsp; because that's I think when people initially&nbsp; hear of this, you know, their initial reaction&nbsp;&nbsp; is grab the pitchforks and let's just go kill&nbsp; them all off. And it's so much more complex&nbsp;&nbsp; than that. And because we don't know about trauma&nbsp; and the different types of ways trauma can affect&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody from turning them into a psychopath to&nbsp; making them a victim that they need freed from,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, making them a slave that they do not&nbsp; want to be. There's different levels of how we&nbsp;&nbsp; need to approach all of this. You know, ultimately&nbsp; we want everybody, like how I was saying earlier,&nbsp;&nbsp; to no matter what they've done, no matter how bad&nbsp; it was, we want everybody to come out and say,&nbsp;&nbsp; "All right, I'm going to wipe my hands clean.&nbsp; I'm defecting from this. Enough is enough. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; breaking the cycle just like Magnolia did, just&nbsp; like Kathy O'Brien did. I want to be on that&nbsp;&nbsp; side." You know, you're going to also have the&nbsp; people who are they're unchangeable psychopaths.&nbsp;&nbsp; like they just don't have the capacity to heal,&nbsp; you know, even if even if we want them to. And so&nbsp;&nbsp; understanding these different levels of the&nbsp; types of of victimization that happens, the&nbsp;&nbsp; side effects of it, the fracturing and the damage&nbsp; that it does, and the different levels of damage,&nbsp;&nbsp; what can be healed from, what can't be. You know,&nbsp; it's so important that we understand this because&nbsp;&nbsp; that's going to be the key to stopping it is&nbsp; realizing how deeply embedded generationally&nbsp;&nbsp; it is and that it's not just a swift one and done.&nbsp; We just take everybody out and it stops. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; this goes back so many generations and it's it's&nbsp; still being perpetrated so many generations below&nbsp;&nbsp; us. And so having that understanding can really&nbsp; help us empathize where it needs empathized and&nbsp;&nbsp; accept with open arms the people who you know&nbsp; if they knew that they could be safe they they'd&nbsp;&nbsp; have arms to walk into that would accept them back&nbsp; into society and want them to heal just like how&nbsp;&nbsp; you know you have done and countless others. Um,&nbsp; and then also knowing where to throw the hammer&nbsp;&nbsp; of justice and to say, "All right, if you're not,&nbsp; if you aren't going to take the initiative to want&nbsp;&nbsp; to heal and to come out of this and to stop what&nbsp; you're doing, then we have to figure out the right&nbsp;&nbsp; way to, you know, persecute and, you know, bring&nbsp; justice to those people um who have no intention&nbsp;&nbsp; of stopping, you So hearing all of this really&nbsp; helps us understand the different layers not just&nbsp;&nbsp; of how these stories and networks work, but the&nbsp; different layers of perpetration, victimization,&nbsp;&nbsp; and the side effects of that, you know, and how&nbsp; we can stop this if we take the time to actually&nbsp;&nbsp; understand trauma, you know, and how it affects&nbsp; society, how it affects the individual, how it&nbsp;&nbsp; affects a family, you know, and how powerful it is&nbsp; that people people take that initiative no matter&nbsp;&nbsp; what the risk is and and say Enough is enough&nbsp; just like what you did and have the courage to&nbsp;&nbsp; walk away from it. Yes. Yeah. I totally agree. And&nbsp; it's a it's an evolution of consciousness. Like I&nbsp;&nbsp; I just see it as I mean I can't help but see it&nbsp; as like the the cycles and waves of the planet.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm like, how many more generations is this going&nbsp; to go on before it is like exiled from the planet?&nbsp;&nbsp; Like this is like I just think the more exposure&nbsp; and less from a victim standpoint of Yeah. like&nbsp;&nbsp; let's go with the pitchforks like and more like&nbsp; bringing light and awareness and healing to this&nbsp;&nbsp; for it to make its way off the planet like so we&nbsp; can go back to the light and bring heaven on earth&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially which is like what I believe is&nbsp; the goal of being here we're We're supposed to&nbsp;&nbsp; unify back to the lightest of the light, like our&nbsp; divinity, and bring it here to this fallen world,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know. Amen to that. And with leaders like you&nbsp; who lead with love and compassion, but also know&nbsp;&nbsp; boundaries, how to put your foot down and where&nbsp; to execute um persecution, you know, and judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is, you know, this really is the way. And&nbsp; it's not just one or the other. Like we have to&nbsp;&nbsp; be in both um in both states of consciousness&nbsp; of understanding this as a whole, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and hearing these testimonies I think are the&nbsp; way that that happens. And so again, I just I&nbsp;&nbsp; commend you. You're brilliant. You're incredible.&nbsp; You're eloquent. I would have never guessed that&nbsp;&nbsp; this is like your first time coming on a platform&nbsp; like this and thinking about it because you're so&nbsp;&nbsp; versed and like you're you're amazing uh public&nbsp; speaker. Oh my goodness. Thank you. At first, I&nbsp;&nbsp; felt like there was a big blank and I was nervous&nbsp; at first, but thank you for saying that. You did&nbsp;&nbsp; wonderful and I'm really excited to have you&nbsp; back on and to dig into more parts of your story&nbsp;&nbsp; because we covered so much today. This is like&nbsp; a jam-packed episode, but Yes. Yes. So many more&nbsp;&nbsp; layers to your story, including I do. But I feel&nbsp; we covered really like all the groups, like a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; of groundwork actually, 100%. And next time we can&nbsp; always go over and sort of polish it off anything&nbsp;&nbsp; that um we didn't include this time and uh move&nbsp; into different aspects of your story um on part&nbsp;&nbsp; two. So I'm really excited to have you back on and&nbsp; really appreciate you Magnolia coming on today and&nbsp;&nbsp; sharing with us and giving us your puzzle piece.&nbsp; Thank you so much, Emma. Thank you. Really,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're welcome. It's an honor. It's the least we&nbsp; can do is is listen to all of this after you had&nbsp;&nbsp; to endure and survive it. So, it's my great honor&nbsp; to be able to do this and I know other people on&nbsp;&nbsp; the other side of the screen feel the same way.&nbsp; And so, for everybody listening on the other side&nbsp;&nbsp; of the screen, I will have Magnolia's email below&nbsp; as well as her Instagram. Go support her if you're&nbsp;&nbsp; a survivor or not. And then, of course, if you&nbsp; are a survivor of any kind or somebody dealing&nbsp;&nbsp; with trauma or PTSD or just needing to sort of&nbsp; move forward in your healing, if you're stuck,&nbsp;&nbsp; um you have a resource. So, please reach out&nbsp; to her and see if um you know it's a good fit&nbsp;&nbsp; on both ends and if if what you're going through&nbsp; is something she can help you with. Um but please&nbsp;&nbsp; share her information as well with with with&nbsp; other wounded warriors who might be privy to,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, wanting somebody that can help them walk&nbsp; through their healing journey. And uh so I'll have&nbsp;&nbsp; all that below. And I really encourage you guys&nbsp; to help share and elevate her and to share this&nbsp;&nbsp; episode with people um that you think would find&nbsp; value and education and and ultimately just people&nbsp;&nbsp; curious about learning the the ins and outs of&nbsp; the world like we're curious about it. And I'll&nbsp;&nbsp; have all my information below as well. Follow me&nbsp; wherever you guys can. We couldn't do this without&nbsp;&nbsp; you you guys. Thank you so much for listening.&nbsp; God bless you all and we will see you next time.
