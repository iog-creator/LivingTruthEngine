Kind: captions Language: en [Music] After over 5 years, we now bring you the second&nbsp; video interview with James Casbolt. In bases 4,&nbsp;&nbsp; Casmolt expanded on Barry King's material,&nbsp; first released in bases 1 and two. King talked&nbsp;&nbsp; about generated life forms, horrendous&nbsp; mind and population control programs,&nbsp;&nbsp; mannequin and puppet master, all going on in&nbsp; Britain's Barkshire countryside at a base under&nbsp;&nbsp; the village of Peasmore. Casbolt highlighted&nbsp; even more horrific programs involving children,&nbsp;&nbsp; genetic experimentation, and further terrifying&nbsp; details. And even a base under parliament itself&nbsp;&nbsp; called CLC1. In bases two and four, a further&nbsp; witness, Matt Todd, gave us even more detail&nbsp;&nbsp; with the involvement of the US military in&nbsp; the abductions or myabs and how he killed four&nbsp;&nbsp; grays at a base where people's souls were kept in&nbsp; cages. Bases 7 gave a super soldier Dave Maro and&nbsp;&nbsp; his trauma-induced monarch programming. Selected&nbsp; at birth and trained to fight off planet. Perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp; M. Todd demonstrated radio signals coming from&nbsp; his many implants. The existence of some other&nbsp;&nbsp; form of dimensional reality and a war with super&nbsp; beings is implied. So now in bases 9, we present&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Prince aka James Casbolt. This time the SS&nbsp; comes into focus and the nightmare continues. That&nbsp;&nbsp; is if any of these claims can ever be proved with&nbsp; factual evidential data. James Casbold. [Music]&nbsp;&nbsp; James, we met in a previous persona as James on&nbsp; previous edition of u the basis. You've got a&nbsp;&nbsp; different persona now or you've got two different&nbsp; um ways you portray yourself to the public. Can&nbsp;&nbsp; you explain what the difference is or why you've&nbsp; changed or has there been a change? Michael Prince&nbsp;&nbsp; James Castle. It's just a simple matter of I'm&nbsp; using the name of my birth name Michael Prince.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a name I was given at birth by my biological&nbsp; mother. So, so where what's the story of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Casbold story? Um, that was a family I was adopted&nbsp; into the Casbolt family. Yeah. So um that was&nbsp;&nbsp; um 81. Yeah. I need to go back to the beginning&nbsp; when I was a baby. the origins of project Ibis. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; it was the name of the project I was um involved&nbsp; in uh or born into effectively um was named&nbsp;&nbsp; project Ibis and it was run by the NSA and MI6&nbsp; and um it was it was um tracking of 42 children&nbsp;&nbsp; from different countries and um all those children&nbsp; were brought to a facility in Canada in the Rocky&nbsp;&nbsp; Mountains um underneath a small town called Nelson&nbsp; and what what countries why were they selected?&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, according to the file information I've seen,&nbsp; they were se selected for cuz their DNA the&nbsp;&nbsp; um the NSA information I've seen um says&nbsp; that we have what they call blood prime which&nbsp;&nbsp; um it states anunnaki DNA. What is blood prime?&nbsp; What's what specifically are the differences? I&nbsp;&nbsp; think it's a type of alien DNA, human um alien&nbsp; hybrid. Is there any particular recess negative,&nbsp;&nbsp; positive or anything like that? Um I think it&nbsp; there's that the recess negative factor in it. I&nbsp;&nbsp; think the the only negative factor. Yeah. So that&nbsp; how are the ch children selected as such? I mean&nbsp;&nbsp; does that mean there's some means of selecting&nbsp; is it from different you know at birth other&nbsp;&nbsp; people's bloodline medical records I think the&nbsp; mothers were um selected and um the embryos were&nbsp;&nbsp; cloned embryos grown in a artificial environment&nbsp; um test tube babies and I think those from my&nbsp;&nbsp; understanding those um embryos were then implanted&nbsp; into specific women who gave birth And then at the&nbsp;&nbsp; time of birth, the children were transported to&nbsp; the um underground facility in Nelson in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of that facility was a Q552. Where's&nbsp; Nelson? Is it in Matoma or Winnipeg somewhere?&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a small town in the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; It's inh British Columbia in Canada. um that so we were all taken there at the time of birth.&nbsp; Some some from America, I think. Um there was some&nbsp;&nbsp; from South America obviously, some from the&nbsp; UK. Um I don't know who the other 42 children&nbsp;&nbsp; are. I've got a rough idea now. Why 42? I don't&nbsp; know. Is it just just that's what the sample was?&nbsp;&nbsp; There's no significance in it. I don't know.&nbsp; I'm sure there's significance in it somewhere,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I don't have that information. Many of the&nbsp; children were transported on private CIA jets,&nbsp;&nbsp; small small jets or just just like Leah jets.&nbsp; Yeah. And um transported there. Um so what's the&nbsp;&nbsp; program? What specifically is the purpose of it?&nbsp; There's a lot of effort being put into this then.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why? Um project IBIS is again the Nazi connection.&nbsp; The name comes from the um the Giza Intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp; Group underneath the Giza pyramids, the Nazi group&nbsp; in World War II. What Nazi group is this? Um it's&nbsp;&nbsp; known as the Giza Intelligence. The Nazi group.&nbsp; Which part of the Giza plateau were they involved&nbsp;&nbsp; with? I don't know. I just know they were um based&nbsp; underneath the Giza pyramids. It was a facility,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Nazis in World War II. And um the name&nbsp; connects to Thoth, the um the immortal,&nbsp;&nbsp; the Egyptian. His um some connection with an ibis&nbsp; bird would represent Thoth in Egypt. Now what are&nbsp;&nbsp; they were they trying to find in Egypt or what&nbsp; did they find in Egypt? I think they found some&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of life extension technology and this was&nbsp; effectively that this was a major part of the&nbsp;&nbsp; IBIS program was life extension regeneration.&nbsp; Is there is there some kind of chamber that you&nbsp;&nbsp; could mention or any any particular area? Yeah,&nbsp; there's the emerald chambers. The emerald the or&nbsp;&nbsp; the emerald rooms, but I think that is that's in&nbsp; more than one location. Um I'd rather not talk&nbsp;&nbsp; too much about the emerald rooms. I'd rather just&nbsp; focus um because it's such a complex subject. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; um is this to do with the storage of souls on&nbsp; the earth and the recreation on earth? This is&nbsp;&nbsp; very much physical um this is they at the um Q552&nbsp; we were being indoctrinated with Nazi principles&nbsp;&nbsp; um Germanic principles um were you indoctrinated&nbsp; by Nazis? Yeah, it was Nazi. It wasn't just Nazis&nbsp;&nbsp; there, but there was a big Nazi presence. Um, some&nbsp; of the philosophies were indoctrinated with there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, you see those philosophies in um, Germanic&nbsp; organizations to this day like the Odinist&nbsp;&nbsp; Fellowship in this country. Um, the philosophies&nbsp; are based around obviously the creation of an&nbsp;&nbsp; Uber man, a superman. But, um, they see life on&nbsp; Earth as a means to an end. They're not trying&nbsp;&nbsp; to get somewhere else. They're not trying to get&nbsp; to heaven or another planet. They want to become&nbsp;&nbsp; physically immortal in this body on this earth&nbsp; and stay here. Now um we're also indoctrinated&nbsp;&nbsp; with the the Germanic belief in um endless&nbsp; warfare. Um is that would be our reality once&nbsp;&nbsp; we stayed here physically. We um our reality would&nbsp; be endless warfare and there'd be periods of rest.&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to maybe reorganize the the logistics&nbsp; or um they talked about the thousand-year Reich,&nbsp;&nbsp; a thousand years of peace. Um which would be&nbsp; periods of rest in between the warfare and then it&nbsp;&nbsp; would just be a continuous cycle. And um that was&nbsp; effectively um how they had indoctrinated us to&nbsp;&nbsp; be assassins when we were older so we could keep&nbsp; functioning. If we were concerned about the next&nbsp;&nbsp; um hit and had anxiety about that we wouldn't&nbsp; be able to carry out and function. But if in our&nbsp;&nbsp; mindset if we believe that we were designed&nbsp; for endless warfare and it would never stop&nbsp;&nbsp; um we would just accept that and be able and be&nbsp; relaxed when we were involved in assassination.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now what kind of assassination or what kind of&nbsp; missions are we are we talking about here? Um this is in numerous countries. um many different&nbsp; ways. So it's it's um is it I mean we are we sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of going and doing a one two three bump somebody&nbsp; off or or just just that different types of of&nbsp;&nbsp; assassination? Um a lot of it was standard um&nbsp; gunplay. Um I mean that that came later on down&nbsp;&nbsp; the road obviously we were actually raised&nbsp; in this facility as babies. So from 1976 to&nbsp;&nbsp; 1979 we were raised in this base. Um the where&nbsp; it was in the mountains um it was underground&nbsp;&nbsp; but there was um it was above ground the main&nbsp; entrance. It was like an aircraft hanger and&nbsp;&nbsp; um what kind of general area are we talking&nbsp; about? What can you describe in it? It's in&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountains. It's um it's a very private&nbsp; location near Nelson. Just near Nelson in&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountains. Would there be a mountain&nbsp; name you could name? It's near I think it I'm not sure the mountain name. I know that&nbsp; there's a um a logging compound nearby and&nbsp;&nbsp; there's an old um access route near the logging&nbsp; compound that actually takes you to the base in&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountain and Nelson's a very small town. Um&nbsp; again the above ground um section of it was a&nbsp;&nbsp; aircraft hanger and um when we were first brought&nbsp; there as B is it a is it got a runway and landing&nbsp;&nbsp; place or um it's fenced off high fences and&nbsp; um it has yeah it has a runway in front of&nbsp;&nbsp; the aircraft hanger if you come in but the um the&nbsp; aircraft hanger sits or fenced around the runways&nbsp;&nbsp; here and the aircraft hangers here. Yeah, it's&nbsp; quite a big building. Um but as babies we were&nbsp;&nbsp; um we slept in the aircraft hanger often&nbsp; because um it was essentially a trauma&nbsp;&nbsp; center. So they wanted us to be exposed to the&nbsp; cold and there was um sets of cops in there.&nbsp;&nbsp; So this is high up I mean a couple of thousand&nbsp; feet up high the Rocky Mountain very high. Um it's near B National Park right where um so they&nbsp; we were kind of being exposed to the elements&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially. We slept there um in the aircraft&nbsp; hang with the doors open and there was rows of&nbsp;&nbsp; CS and we were under 24-hour armed guard all&nbsp; at all times. So we couldn't be rescued from&nbsp;&nbsp; that facility because there were factions there&nbsp; that would rescue us at the first opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The people that like the parents or or the well&nbsp; special forces groups um people that guarded us&nbsp;&nbsp; were they wore um they wore black uniforms. um&nbsp; some and they wore black masks, but sometimes they&nbsp;&nbsp; wore the um ultramodern SS uniform, which what?&nbsp; It's um it's kind of like your standard SAS Black&nbsp;&nbsp; Ops uniform. Um it's black boots, black trousers,&nbsp; black top, but the um it has chest plates and&nbsp;&nbsp; there's leather around the arms and it has the&nbsp; um SS double rune. Yeah. The the SS symbol. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um so that's a modern uniform. When you're saying&nbsp; a modern uniform, you're talking about post World&nbsp;&nbsp; War II. Yeah. This is the the the modern SS&nbsp; uniform. So getting back to this SS uniform,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think what era are we talking about? '7s.&nbsp; This was 1976 and we were first taken there&nbsp;&nbsp; as babies. So that means that the that's the SS&nbsp; wearing those uniforms in Canada. So they must&nbsp;&nbsp; have authority to do so. um there was some kind of&nbsp; internal war going on in the military and in the&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence community. So is this this is um are&nbsp; you saying this is therefore a Nazi organization&nbsp;&nbsp; that's that's doing this? Um yeah. Yeah. So by by&nbsp; inference it means that the connections with AL499&nbsp;&nbsp; and the other places in the UK must be essentially&nbsp; under Nazi control or is that NSA control? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is it. You see, there's a big Nazi element&nbsp; within the NSA because this was a officially an&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA facility, the Q552 at Nelson. This was a NSA&nbsp; base officially, the Q552 facility at Nelson. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, there's a there's a major Nazi element within&nbsp; the NSA. So, that essentially is saying that the&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA is a Nazi organization and a survivor&nbsp; organization from World War II. Um, yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd say that's a fairly accurate statement. So, de&nbsp; facto World War II was won by the by the Nazis. I&nbsp;&nbsp; wouldn't say they won, but I wouldn't say they&nbsp; lost either. It survived. Survived. Yeah. In&nbsp;&nbsp; an underground fashion. If the NSA is essentially&nbsp; protecting the Nazis or the Nazis are running the&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA. Yeah. Is is that what you're you're saying?&nbsp; Um I'd say that the Nazis faction is running MI6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um just to go off topic slightly before I carry&nbsp; on about what happened at the AL um Q552. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; my main contact in MI6, um, he's a director of&nbsp; special operations, a man named Alfred Bonner. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; is this your current contact or was your contact?&nbsp; He's been my contact for years and he's my current&nbsp;&nbsp; contact. I've carried out many assassinations&nbsp; under his instructions. Um, so you're saying&nbsp;&nbsp; this publicly? Is this um he's not he's not&nbsp; publicly known but people can contact MI6 and&nbsp;&nbsp; ask to speak to director Bonner you can contact&nbsp; MI6 on the website the phone number and MI6 will&nbsp;&nbsp; admit they do have a director Bonner there so&nbsp; what is the function of of telling us about&nbsp;&nbsp; this now is are they inviting people to to ask&nbsp; those questions or do they want that information&nbsp;&nbsp; out they want this information out they want this&nbsp; information out um Alfred Bonner he's from Bavaria&nbsp;&nbsp; um in German effectively. He's um he you see him&nbsp; very interesting looking man. Um you your classic&nbsp;&nbsp; Aryan giant. The guy's 6'6. Um looks about&nbsp; 52. Huge guy. Yeah. Massive shoulders. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; very blonde hair going almost white now cuz he's&nbsp; getting a bit older. Um, wears your classic MIB&nbsp;&nbsp; outfit. The fedora hat. That's his style of dress.&nbsp; Where's the fedora hat, black suit, um, piercing&nbsp;&nbsp; blue eyes, has a scar down his left side. That's&nbsp; from the officer class from fighting. I'm not sure&nbsp;&nbsp; where he got the scar. Um, this guy amazing guy.&nbsp; It's a characteristic of German upper class used&nbsp;&nbsp; to have a a scar. That's interesting. From sword&nbsp; fighting. It's interesting you say that. I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; know that. Um, very interesting character. He um&nbsp; from Bavaria, close friends with Henry Kissinger&nbsp;&nbsp; or Henry Kisser also from Bavaria. He seems to&nbsp; have an amazing ability to stay young and healthy,&nbsp;&nbsp; relatively speaking. Um, Alfred Bonner was the&nbsp; director of uh, security at Dulce at the time&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Doulie rescue. And now there's been a book&nbsp; published by Pilington, I think it is. Um, I could&nbsp;&nbsp; start correcting saying the whole Dolce thing&nbsp; is a fraud. They've stuck bits on the mountain&nbsp;&nbsp; to make it look as if what's going on. No, Duly is&nbsp; real. Dolce is 100% there. So, I mean, why do you&nbsp;&nbsp; think there'd be elements within MI5 publishing&nbsp; books, saying this stuff's wrong and it's shadows&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's it's a it's a wrong? I'm not really&nbsp; interested in the whole recent book has been&nbsp;&nbsp; published. Um, you know, I'm not really interested&nbsp; in all that. It's I know it's Dulce is real. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; um it's a important place for the new world order.&nbsp; So, what's what's the function of Dulce? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; we've heard certain underground things that which&nbsp; were released in the late '7s. Is there anything&nbsp;&nbsp; new about it? Is it current? I don't I've got a&nbsp; friend um in the CIA works at Oakidge National&nbsp;&nbsp; Laboratories in Tennessee and he often works&nbsp; down at Dulce. Um I mean he sent me pictures&nbsp;&nbsp; of the first level got color photographs and&nbsp; it's not really the first level isn't high tech.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's kind of just a damp old base, you know, like&nbsp; sort of it's a bit run down the first level. Not&nbsp;&nbsp; what you'd expect to see at all. The old elevator&nbsp; shafts and things. Are you able to provide those&nbsp;&nbsp; pictures at all? Yeah, I can. I've um I think they&nbsp; were released on Project Avalon a couple of years&nbsp;&nbsp; back, right? I can show you those pictures. Um,&nbsp; you know, but when you go down the levels, it does&nbsp;&nbsp; get more advanced down there. It's a essentially&nbsp; um Have you been down to those levels or have you&nbsp;&nbsp; been shown them? Um there is connections with um&nbsp; IBS and Dulce Douli is essentially a um officially&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a psychiatry center. Um they when the um&nbsp; employees walk around the facility, there's&nbsp;&nbsp; certain sections with um people in like hospital&nbsp; rooms with um almost like prison rooms in a way,&nbsp;&nbsp; but not with bars, like um plastic windows,&nbsp; you know, thick plastic and uh you know, you&nbsp;&nbsp; have people there in hospital gowns and um sitting&nbsp; on their beds and it it the the briefing is that&nbsp;&nbsp; they're um incurably insane. pain and that they're&nbsp; doing high-risk um drug treatments on the insane&nbsp;&nbsp; and it's actually a top secret um psychiatry&nbsp; facility. That's what they're first told when&nbsp;&nbsp; they go in there. So uh and then they they never&nbsp; come out these people. Yeah. Um I think a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; them don't come out. There's um as you go the hall&nbsp; these particular hallways um at Dulce these rooms&nbsp;&nbsp; in um the corridor curved round and every kind&nbsp; of 12 rooms you have an operating theater. These&nbsp;&nbsp; people taken out as operating theaters there.&nbsp; And uh the Q552 facility in Canada in Nelson was&nbsp;&nbsp; um there was a lot of uh Nazi psychiatry um&nbsp; conditioning going on there. What sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; what are you talking about conditioning? Well,&nbsp; for instance um at the facility they were um it&nbsp;&nbsp; was essentially a trauma center. Now they did a&nbsp; lot of conditioning with us with wild animals and&nbsp;&nbsp; what they were doing there they they used um&nbsp; Canadian wolves, they used snakes, they used&nbsp;&nbsp; um cats, wild cats and tigers and things. Um they&nbsp; were giving us the attributes of wild animals. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; they were subjecting us to um um for when we were&nbsp; older um for all terrain warfare, jungle warfare,&nbsp;&nbsp; artic warfare. So we had the attributes of wild&nbsp; animals. How do you get the attribute of a wild&nbsp;&nbsp; animal? They used um they set up I think it was&nbsp; a second level down at the Q552. Um they set up a&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of pen um about 30 ft 30 ft wide. Um they set&nbsp; up a this pen they put the babies in the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp; um they put wild animals in the pen. They might&nbsp; put snakes in there or you know wolves. Only&nbsp;&nbsp; one type of animal at a time. They didn't&nbsp; mix the animals. It was always one type.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this um pen was very similar to a Skinner box&nbsp; they use in psychiatry. Skinner box. A Skinner&nbsp;&nbsp; box is um famous psychiatrist Skinner. I forget&nbsp; his first name. Um he would he designed this box&nbsp;&nbsp; and he they put babies in it and they put animals&nbsp; in with the babies and they were doing cognitive&nbsp;&nbsp; behavior test. See, now the babies would react to&nbsp; the animals and um they would in this partic this&nbsp;&nbsp; this particular device um they put us in there and&nbsp; they set up screens in the corners of the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh people's the people's faces would be put on&nbsp; the screens um enlarged and uh the faces would&nbsp;&nbsp; call us and get our attention. We'd look and the&nbsp; faces would start talking to us people and then&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the faces would look like they were um changing&nbsp; into uh half human, half whatever the animal was.&nbsp;&nbsp; So if it was a snake, if they were putting snakes&nbsp; in the pen, this the the person talking would&nbsp;&nbsp; um start talking to us and then his face would&nbsp; change into half human, half snake lizard and&nbsp;&nbsp; um they George Bush senior was the main um&nbsp; handler of that particular uh facility and um&nbsp;&nbsp; his face would often come on the screen and talk&nbsp; to us and He would do the very much the rep the&nbsp;&nbsp; reptile with the snakes. That would be his area.&nbsp; Was that something that was done on a recorded&nbsp;&nbsp; type of a level or was it he did it personally?&nbsp; He was on the screen. I'm not sure if he was that&nbsp;&nbsp; he was there sometimes physically but I mean the&nbsp; guy travels all around the world to all different&nbsp;&nbsp; bases. He's a major programmer so I don't know he&nbsp; could have been over the other side of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and he would come on and um Is this something&nbsp; that you experienced directly? This Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; I I saw him. He used to talk to us, talk to me.&nbsp; And u And what age were you when this happened?&nbsp;&nbsp; I was this was 76. I was a baby. Yeah. And this,&nbsp; you know, this carried on. I spent from 76 to 79&nbsp;&nbsp; there and grew up there. Um the uh Queen Mother&nbsp; as well, she was a programmer there. She would&nbsp;&nbsp; um her face would be flashed on the screen, but&nbsp; her specialtity was wolves. Whenever they put the&nbsp;&nbsp; walls in with us, um she would come on and she'd&nbsp; talk to us and um she would start to change into&nbsp;&nbsp; halfwoman, half wolf like face on the screen. Was&nbsp; this done by some kind of electronic video effect&nbsp;&nbsp; or I don't know. I don't know. Um, can you name&nbsp; any other animals associated with different other&nbsp;&nbsp; people? Um, the only ones I remember is um George&nbsp; Brcina with snakes and the queen mother with&nbsp;&nbsp; um wolves. It's the place was very dark. I'm still&nbsp; starting to it's difficult to remember everything&nbsp;&nbsp; that happened there. Still coming back in bits and&nbsp; pieces. Um, I remember being put in the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp; um toy the group of babies and um there were toys&nbsp; put in and um one of the babies um took a toy off&nbsp;&nbsp; another baby and the um the little baby turned&nbsp; around and hissed at the other child like a snake&nbsp;&nbsp; and his face sort of went like a snake. So we this&nbsp; was absorbed into them psychologically. Yeah. Into&nbsp;&nbsp; their psyche. Yeah. And with the DNA anyway that&nbsp; an anarchy DNA that the NSA were looking for. [Music] In part one, we heard how Michael&nbsp; Prince is the birth name for James Casbolt&nbsp;&nbsp; and how he was taken to a base in Canada near&nbsp; the small mountain town of Nelson in British&nbsp;&nbsp; Columbia for cyborg enhancement as mind control&nbsp; children selected by their specific blood types&nbsp;&nbsp; on how they were exposed to the open cold night&nbsp; in a large aircraft style hanger to sort out the&nbsp;&nbsp; men from the boys just as in ancient Sparta.&nbsp; then guarded by Nazi SS troops in modern tight&nbsp;&nbsp; uniforms in the late 1970s. Michael sent this&nbsp; scan of one of his security clearances. However,&nbsp;&nbsp; in earlier images he sent claiming to be at&nbsp; the Dulce base, this could be anywhere. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; if anyone really knows what these forms refer&nbsp; to, please contact melblue yonder.co.uk. What age were you when this happened? I was a This&nbsp; was 76. I was a baby. Yeah. And this, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; this carried on. I spent from 76 to 79 there and&nbsp; grew up there. Um the uh queen mother as well,&nbsp;&nbsp; she was a programmer there. She would um her&nbsp; face would be flashed on the screen, but her&nbsp;&nbsp; specialtity was wolves. whenever they put the&nbsp; walls in with us, um, she would come on and she'd&nbsp;&nbsp; talk to us and, um, she would start to change into&nbsp; half woman, half wolf like face on the screen. Was&nbsp;&nbsp; this done by some kind of electronic video effect&nbsp; or I don't know. I don't know. Um, can you name&nbsp;&nbsp; any other animals associated with different other&nbsp; people? Um, the only ones I remember is um George&nbsp;&nbsp; Brcina with snakes and the queen mother with um&nbsp; wolves. It's the place was very dark. I'm still&nbsp;&nbsp; starting to It's difficult to remember everything&nbsp; that happened there. It's still coming back in&nbsp;&nbsp; bits and pieces. Um, I remember being put in&nbsp; the pen and um toy this group of babies and&nbsp;&nbsp; um there were toys put in and um one of the&nbsp; babies um took a toy off another baby and the&nbsp;&nbsp; um the little baby turned around and hissed at the&nbsp; other child like a snake and his face sort of went&nbsp;&nbsp; like a snake. So weird that this was absorbed into&nbsp; them psychologically or Yeah. into their psyche.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. And with the DNA anyway, the Anunnaki DNA&nbsp; that the NSA were looking for. So explain to&nbsp;&nbsp; the Anunnaki are I mean there's lots of different&nbsp; versions or different things about the Anunnaki.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is this kind of Anunnaki or precisely&nbsp; that I mean that term's banded around a lot. Um our group was there were Germanic roots Aryan&nbsp; roots which I would say connects to al deon in&nbsp;&nbsp; the plleades. So I think anunnaki I think is a&nbsp; Sumerian word that just means visitors from the&nbsp;&nbsp; stars or something like that. So I think&nbsp; in our particular group our heritage was&nbsp;&nbsp; um I mean we discussed this before in the last&nbsp; interview I think um you know it goes back to&nbsp;&nbsp; France, Germany, Bavaria, Greece in the Middle&nbsp; East goes back and um does he do Egypt to Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; connections with Egypt? Yeah. The tribe of&nbsp; Dan and Kaish. Yeah, definitely. So that's&nbsp;&nbsp; this is a white race of a white Germanic well&nbsp; Aryan race. And I don't mean just blondhaired. So we were we were being um conditioned every&nbsp; day and um into what what function? Um assassins&nbsp;&nbsp; mainly. assassins. Um there was, you know, there&nbsp; psychic things, remote viewing and that, but it's&nbsp;&nbsp; mainly assassins. Um physical soldiers, this is&nbsp; why they wanted the all terrain attributes. Um so&nbsp;&nbsp; just basic soldiering, not basic soldiering, um&nbsp; specific operations such as um crash retrieval,&nbsp;&nbsp; hunting, um tracking, aliens, what kind of crash&nbsp; retrieval? um ships that were shot down from alien&nbsp;&nbsp; creatures. So, you were specifically dealing with&nbsp; the crashed retrieval of non-human craft. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; that came later. There was many of them um&nbsp; tracking um alien entities through jungle terrain,&nbsp;&nbsp; desert terrains, almost smelling them, almost&nbsp; picking up this scent like a even though to the&nbsp;&nbsp; average person made these aliens would appear&nbsp; human. Uh would you would you There was all&nbsp;&nbsp; different types. We trapped all different types.&nbsp; There was a wolf type of being a bipedal humanoid&nbsp;&nbsp; wolf that like a Bigfoot. We trapped those&nbsp; creatures. So we trapped those. Were they were&nbsp;&nbsp; they people indigenous to Earth or were they um&nbsp; were they walking like through the dimensional or&nbsp;&nbsp; No, these were physical creatures that physically&nbsp; traveled in ships. There was a landing zone in&nbsp;&nbsp; um there was an NSA facility on the island of&nbsp; Panang. dense um the looking glass facility,&nbsp;&nbsp; dense jungle coverage, um regular physical&nbsp; landing, the ships will come down there. Some&nbsp;&nbsp; of these wolf beings. Did you ever see the the&nbsp; ships or uh Yeah. Yeah, I saw the ships that came&nbsp;&nbsp; later in the early '8s. Um if I just can stick&nbsp; to this what happened in Canada and um so we're&nbsp;&nbsp; being conditioned there and um essentially&nbsp; being tortured. It was a trauma center. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, how did the conditioning function? What&nbsp; happened when you were conditioned? What was&nbsp;&nbsp; done? Um, well, they terrorize us. They'd um&nbsp; I remember um they'd the guards, these S SS um&nbsp;&nbsp; uniform guys would um they they brought a a huge&nbsp; snake into the um pen one day and I think this&nbsp;&nbsp; was some kind of anaconda from South America. You&nbsp; know, it took like three or four of them to carry&nbsp;&nbsp; it in. This was huge. They put that in and uh I&nbsp; remember a young young girl there was involved in&nbsp;&nbsp; the program in something about 18 years old and&nbsp; um they fed someone to the snake in front of us alive. Yeah. Yeah. It's difficult to for me&nbsp; to look at the memory and look at the person,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I know someone was in the same way that&nbsp; we'd feed their live rats to snakes. Yeah. Watch&nbsp;&nbsp; live mice. Yeah. Yeah. And was this what was the&nbsp; function of this? Um I think they break us down,&nbsp;&nbsp; terrorize us to control us. I saw a lot&nbsp; of that stuff. saw a lot of um people and&nbsp;&nbsp; um later on I saw a young girl thrown in a cage&nbsp; with a wolf and um like torn to pieces and that&nbsp;&nbsp; was that was in England later on. Um what&nbsp; part of England? Barkshire. Barkshire A499. it. We had to be under armed guard 24 hours&nbsp; a day at the Q552 um because it was um there&nbsp;&nbsp; was groups apparently that wanted to rescue us&nbsp; from that cuz it's not you know if you didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; know that did you find out later. Yeah. Um&nbsp; so they're not definitely not all powerful&nbsp;&nbsp; or anything like that. Definitely. It wasn't&nbsp; like a um impenetrable facility. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of these facilities aren't. You can get&nbsp; in them if you really want. Yeah. Um and boss&nbsp;&nbsp; people out if you really want. Um we were we got&nbsp; to 1979 now and we've been raised there for those&nbsp;&nbsp; years between 76 and 79. And um we were all um&nbsp; put in SUVs, convoy of them to be driven down&nbsp;&nbsp; to another base in America. Uh Dulce Dica. Yeah.&nbsp; Being driven transported down to there in a in a&nbsp;&nbsp; convoy. And um I remember we hadn't got that&nbsp; far out the base. I think we're still in the&nbsp;&nbsp; mountains and the helicopter seemed to come out&nbsp; of nowhere. um small small special forces group um came out and there was a shootout and um some&nbsp; of the guards shot the children. Some of the&nbsp;&nbsp; SS guards shot the children before they could be&nbsp; rescued. some of their children, but most of us&nbsp;&nbsp; were um rescued and we were brought to a building&nbsp; in Toronto, like a um just it was large building,&nbsp;&nbsp; a skyscraper. Yeah. We were brought there&nbsp; to an underground car park there and the&nbsp;&nbsp; top level of the facility was um near Young&nbsp; Street or I don't know where it was. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got I could try and find out, but I'm not&nbsp; exactly sure. But I know it was in Toronto and&nbsp;&nbsp; um we were mean Toronto or I don't I know the&nbsp; area that well. I just know it was um there was&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of skyscrapers there and this was uh one&nbsp; very tall building. Um we're in the top level of&nbsp;&nbsp; the building. you look out across the whole area&nbsp; in it and um how many of them were you were you&nbsp;&nbsp; um that when we got to the um building in&nbsp; Toronto and we we stayed there for a few&nbsp;&nbsp; weeks I remember sitting in a room we used to&nbsp; sit in classrooms together there um 15 20 of us&nbsp;&nbsp; yeah about that so the the group that rescued&nbsp; us were based around com 12 uh in Majestic What's COM 12? COM 12 is a group&nbsp; centered around US naval intelligence,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it's actually a majestic group. Um, the&nbsp; I'm I'm in contact with one of the men who&nbsp;&nbsp; rescued us in America in 79, but I can't say&nbsp; too much about him at the moment. Right. Um, again another Germanic character. We're seeing&nbsp; really that this Nazi control Germanic control&nbsp;&nbsp; is is very much in in control or are they&nbsp; tolerated within the organization? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's good there's good and bad in this faction.&nbsp; I mean, there's this there's a whole Germanic&nbsp;&nbsp; faction which um fighting against the people doing&nbsp; all this evil in the So what do what do we have&nbsp;&nbsp; that what are the two basic good guys bad guys&nbsp; okay that who are the bad guys so to speak and&nbsp;&nbsp; what is their aim and what's their function&nbsp; and what's the purpose of all I can't simply&nbsp;&nbsp; separate into two factions we don't um we we run&nbsp; on survival dynamics what I mean by that is we we&nbsp;&nbsp; it's about the survival of ourselves survivors&nbsp; of our families survival of the organization&nbsp;&nbsp; ations we work in in our race. Um that's how we&nbsp; can understand. We don't believe in good or bad.&nbsp;&nbsp; So ultimately the good and bad side is essentially&nbsp; you're surviving. It's us surviving but then it's&nbsp;&nbsp; not just us surviving. We work on all the survival&nbsp; dynamics. Whereas if um we if a person is abusing&nbsp;&nbsp; children they're working against the survival&nbsp; dynamics. They're our enemy. Right? So this is&nbsp;&nbsp; how we can operate. But we have to have lines and&nbsp; boundaries or else we we we won't know who's who&nbsp;&nbsp; and we won't feel righteous and justified to take&nbsp; military action which we do on a regular basis. We went through operations there. There were&nbsp; surgeons there and um what was the function&nbsp;&nbsp; of those because they um the surgeons cut&nbsp; us open and found um cybernetics inside us.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um so they'd at the Q552 they'd slowly been&nbsp; um cybernating us through with surgery and um essentially creating a cyborg soldier. Now, um&nbsp; these the surgeons at the the um place in Toronto,&nbsp;&nbsp; they they cut us open and apparently they&nbsp; they were like, "What a mess." You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is and they tried and they were thinking&nbsp; about trying to remove it. But then it it turned&nbsp;&nbsp; out that this um technology would integrated into&nbsp; us. It couldn't be removed. It was actually a&nbsp;&nbsp; natural part of our bodies. Now um this can is&nbsp; it detectable in any way? Um, I'm sure it is.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sure it is. All right. So, are you saying that&nbsp; we could somehow if we booked the relevant place,&nbsp;&nbsp; we could check out your cyborgs? If you went&nbsp; to one of those scanners in the airports,&nbsp;&nbsp; would they see it? Um, you know, the new&nbsp; scanners. Yeah, that's interesting. Apparently,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, the bone is a type of metal that um I'm not&nbsp; a scientist, but it's something to do with being&nbsp;&nbsp; off the periodical chart. It's not a um a metal&nbsp; that's known to man, so it won't set off standard&nbsp;&nbsp; metal detectors. I've been told the closest um&nbsp; thing we can compare it to on this planet is&nbsp;&nbsp; is a mixture of gold and diamond. It's extremely&nbsp; hard. So I um So you don't know how that how that&nbsp;&nbsp; works technically. Um there's apparently&nbsp; that that's the the bone and then there's&nbsp;&nbsp; um a small layer of kind of mechanical armor built&nbsp; around that bone to reinforce it further. And um is it got a grown? Apparently that is put in by&nbsp; some uh it's nanotechnology. this all mechanical&nbsp;&nbsp; armor around the bone. The bone itself is&nbsp; apparently metal. This type of metal and&nbsp;&nbsp; um it's built in nanotechnology that&nbsp; is apparently they put some like worms&nbsp;&nbsp; or something in you metallic worms and&nbsp; they lay eggs something like that and&nbsp;&nbsp; it it builds it. Is there a process&nbsp; name there? there was any kind of I&nbsp;&nbsp; think it's connected to the pro name of the&nbsp; Osiris program um the Proteus program um right is there anywhere we could look that&nbsp;&nbsp; up is there any documentation we&nbsp; could look at that not really no um I mean I've got I've got information from&nbsp; NSA databases is but it's not documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. So this stuff you could look up on the&nbsp; internet as such. This is this stuff's never&nbsp;&nbsp; been talked about again. They they they're slowly&nbsp; cybernating these soldiers. What's the program&nbsp;&nbsp; name involved with that or where is it happening?&nbsp; How's it happening in other facilities? He started&nbsp;&nbsp; um the umbrella project of Ibis with numerous&nbsp; projects in that umbrella including mannequin. Um so yeah they wanted to these surgeons wanted&nbsp; to remove it cuz they didn't understand it.&nbsp;&nbsp; So by removing it would it cause more damage&nbsp; so they have to leave it. This is stuff had&nbsp;&nbsp; integrated into us. So they actually classified a&nbsp; new life form. The scientists after that they they&nbsp;&nbsp; um classified us they they called it ascended we&nbsp; were ascended machine technology. Ascended machine&nbsp;&nbsp; machine technology um essentially a cyborg with a&nbsp; soul and they developed a new law um of robotics&nbsp;&nbsp; around us a new science around us. Does this&nbsp; develop onto the secret soldier program? Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; because they wanted to do things like they wanted&nbsp; to uh jump out of a plane without a parachute and&nbsp;&nbsp; land in the jungle in the sea or in the jungle,&nbsp; run 40 miles through the jungle and then um take&nbsp;&nbsp; out your target and be picked up. Are you able&nbsp; to develop anything more on on that story? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; this I mean this came later, all these operations.&nbsp; Um what do you mean by later in the 80s? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's so many. I mean, the operation in&nbsp; Malaysia, for instance, that was a jungle&nbsp;&nbsp; warfare operation. Which operation in Malaysia?&nbsp; In Malaysia on the island of Panang. This was um and on what grounds and what type of&nbsp; military action are you talking about? um the lethal action assassinations where we're&nbsp; having to take the fight to them. Um and&nbsp;&nbsp; who is them? Where would they be? Well, okay.&nbsp; You're going to you want you you want names?&nbsp;&nbsp; So you want something? Okay. We 2007 myself&nbsp; and another individual um drove up to London.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um we travel to South London. Um around&nbsp; the elephant and castle area. Now, um we a an SUV pulled up with um MI6 operatives&nbsp; in there. We were given a briefcase. Um the&nbsp;&nbsp; briefcase had the pistol that I've used for&nbsp; years um for assassinations, which is a 9 mm&nbsp;&nbsp; Smith and Wesson with a pearl handle and has a&nbsp; symbol of a black dragon on the handle. And I&nbsp;&nbsp; I call that gun Drago. And um we were given that&nbsp; briefcase with that um pistol. There were these um&nbsp;&nbsp; small devices in there cubes which um kind of&nbsp; artifact very old pieces of hardware. Um what&nbsp;&nbsp; do you mean by old? You talking about ancient&nbsp; technology? I think it's Egyptian connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe thousands of years maybe older. Very old.&nbsp; um what's like little puzzle boxes, small cubes,&nbsp;&nbsp; a bit like a Rubik's cube, bit of metal around&nbsp; the side and engravings and they're they're simply&nbsp;&nbsp; you you hold them in front of your certain energy&nbsp; centers and you can focus your brain waves through&nbsp;&nbsp; them. So yeah, if you have um so are you saying&nbsp; that the handles of the gum or the the crystals&nbsp;&nbsp; are have a signature to use so you can only&nbsp; use it? Yeah, that's right. The um Drago only&nbsp;&nbsp; I can use. I mean Dre Drago has alien technology&nbsp; incorporated into it has special types of bullets&nbsp;&nbsp; that have been So it's not it's an ordinary bang&nbsp; bang gun. No, it has um special type of bullets&nbsp;&nbsp; that have engravings on them on the bullets&nbsp; and a special type of metal because when you&nbsp;&nbsp; um So you are shooting a a different type of&nbsp; being. Um, if you not shooting an old person,&nbsp;&nbsp; if if you're going to shoot an enhanced soldier or&nbsp; intelligence operative, a Glock 17 is not going to&nbsp;&nbsp; do it. I mean, it's the the the the chest plates&nbsp; reinforced. The slug won't go through it or the&nbsp;&nbsp; um organs are protected. So, is the bullet&nbsp; essentially got a form of nanotechnology on&nbsp;&nbsp; it that breaks the structure of whatever&nbsp; it's hitting? I think so. And there's um there's some occult um aspect to this with the&nbsp; engravings on they're um apparently these bullets&nbsp;&nbsp; are blessed but it's something to do with the&nbsp; Vatican and they um this is brings a new meaning&nbsp;&nbsp; to the term Vatican assassin. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so&nbsp; is it designed to go through some kind of psychic&nbsp;&nbsp; shielding of some description? It's both. It's&nbsp; physical and the psychic sort of go right through&nbsp;&nbsp; some kind of thought based force field. Yeah,&nbsp; exactly. And that's where the engrave ends and the&nbsp;&nbsp; they're blessed by the Vatican. It's nice to know&nbsp; the Vatican are blessing us both other beings. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; so you would so that by definition are you saying&nbsp; that the reason why you guys have been modified&nbsp;&nbsp; bone into being is because these other enhanced&nbsp; beings are running around the place or land or&nbsp;&nbsp; alien or extradimensional beings or what? The&nbsp; these are the same terrestrial. No, these are&nbsp;&nbsp; the same human cyborgs. Um the same people&nbsp; who are raised in these bases. These are our&nbsp;&nbsp; counterparts. We're all the same team. So you're&nbsp; essentially these are our dark counterparts who&nbsp;&nbsp; we're waring against and that's because they've&nbsp; been programmed by them by these SS people. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; we've all been programmed by the SS people but we&nbsp; managed to bust out of it but you didn't. That's&nbsp;&nbsp; the difference. So they've had their programming&nbsp; fully enhanced to a certain level and then you've&nbsp;&nbsp; had your programming enhanced to to try to to to&nbsp; destroy these other people. Basically, it's an&nbsp;&nbsp; internal war. Yeah. And when we um the particular&nbsp; guy we assassinated on that night, his name was&nbsp;&nbsp; um was Dixon Ramy, not his real name, top um&nbsp; MI6 operative. I think we got Yeah, you wanted&nbsp;&nbsp; to know some of the details about this internal&nbsp; assassin war. Um Dixon Ramy, not his real name.&nbsp;&nbsp; um an MI6 mind control handler was my handler&nbsp; in the early '9s and um the handler of many&nbsp;&nbsp; prostitutes, many mind control prostitutes. Um&nbsp; he we we we arrived at his house in South London,&nbsp;&nbsp; myself and another man. And um I walked up the&nbsp; pathway, knocked on the door, a woman answered it,&nbsp;&nbsp; prostitute, MI6 prostitute he was living with&nbsp; at the time, and I used a cube to control her.&nbsp;&nbsp; And can you describe these cubes to the size of&nbsp; Rubik's cubes? Bit bigger than a Rubik's cube.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's quite big. But yeah, um you just hold it in&nbsp; front of your this energy center here. Just hold&nbsp;&nbsp; it. Simple. And then you just talk to them cuz&nbsp; they connect with a cranial implant. So you just&nbsp;&nbsp; say, "Okay, let me in. Sit in the front room.&nbsp; Sit down on the sofa." Um he was in the Where&nbsp;&nbsp; do you store down? Well, I just you hel you hold&nbsp; it in front of you like that with two hands. See&nbsp;&nbsp; how that and it's just a matter of talking, giving&nbsp; commands and um yeah, sit on the sofa. Remy was in&nbsp;&nbsp; the toilet at the time. Um the cube had already&nbsp; started to make him submissive when I was in&nbsp;&nbsp; the house. So, he just came out the toilet in half&nbsp; trance. Anyway, I just told him to go upstairs and&nbsp;&nbsp; wait in the bedroom. and uh he just went upstairs&nbsp; and just sat on the bed and waited for me. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um he had a bar there in the front room, you&nbsp; know, uh and I got the woman to sit down. I got&nbsp;&nbsp; her to pour us a drink. We sat down and um I we&nbsp; were looking for pearls. When I say pearls, it's&nbsp;&nbsp; an NSA code name for a suitcase nuclear weapon. Um&nbsp; he'd stolen the suitcase nuke and um been careless&nbsp;&nbsp; or something. Well, that's what got him shot. And&nbsp; um you then shot him. So I interrogated the woman&nbsp;&nbsp; about the location. Turns out that this thing's on&nbsp; a boat, certain boat in a certain location. Once&nbsp;&nbsp; I got the location of the the pearl, the suitcase&nbsp; nuke is on the river ts. No, it's in an ocean on&nbsp;&nbsp; a boat on a yacht. I won't give the names of the&nbsp; place in the yacht. Um he I had a little radio.&nbsp;&nbsp; I called my associate in and we went upstairs and&nbsp; um he put a pillowcase over Amy's head and then I&nbsp;&nbsp; shot him in the face seven times with a with with&nbsp; your with the pistol. With the pistol with the&nbsp;&nbsp; special bullets. Yeah. Is that because he needed&nbsp; the special bullets? That was my MMO, Miles. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; several shots to the face um on many targets. That&nbsp; was Is that to to disable the brain functions if&nbsp;&nbsp; in the event of it being a manurion that could&nbsp; continue functioning with one shot to maybe the&nbsp;&nbsp; other part of the body? uh they don't want them&nbsp; to regenerate and also um they want to destroy the&nbsp;&nbsp; evidence of the um cranial implants. Yeah, they&nbsp; have to destroy them for the autopsy in case the&nbsp;&nbsp; autopsy went into hands that they can't control.&nbsp; What is your primary function now in in talking&nbsp;&nbsp; now? I'm still active. What's the main thing you&nbsp; want to get across then? What's your what's your&nbsp;&nbsp; um people need to know this what's happening. They&nbsp; need to give themselves a chance cuz things What&nbsp;&nbsp; do you mean by giving themselves a chance? Well,&nbsp; things are going to um speed up and increase or&nbsp;&nbsp; this this wall is underground now, but it's&nbsp; going to burst onto the surface. It's going&nbsp;&nbsp; to burst into the streets, which it already is,&nbsp; but that's going to Can you mention any suggest&nbsp;&nbsp; any indications that which would illustrate that?&nbsp; that's that things are bursting into the streets.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um I I don't I won't give any examples now. Um but&nbsp; people know what I mean in the next few years and&nbsp;&nbsp; um I just want to give people a chance. I mean&nbsp; there are suggestions that uh we've been all been&nbsp;&nbsp; told that we've been programmed or led to believe&nbsp; that you know 2012 is happening. There's going to&nbsp;&nbsp; be catastrophic events. So there's a whole pile of&nbsp; major global catastrophic events being programmed&nbsp;&nbsp; by the so-called Illuminati to illustrate this is&nbsp; the end of the world and bang bang bang we're all&nbsp;&nbsp; going to die. You know the Japanese earthquake&nbsp; that's that happened recently. Is that a is that&nbsp;&nbsp; an example of that earthquake? Some people have&nbsp; suggested it was a you know it was triggered&nbsp;&nbsp; artificially or is that the kind of thing you're&nbsp; talking about? Well, I was um in Nightsbridge at&nbsp;&nbsp; the time. Um and I was contacted um was just&nbsp; around the corner from Buckingham Palace. I&nbsp;&nbsp; was staying at Nightsbridge Hotel and um I was&nbsp; contacted by MI6 the night before an official&nbsp;&nbsp; um MI6 email address and um I was told tomorrow&nbsp; it's going to be a terrorist attack and the guy&nbsp;&nbsp; who contacted me said we wish we could stop it.&nbsp; They called it a day of rage. And uh there were&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of YouTube susers saying there will be an&nbsp; earthquake in Japan on Friday. And there was an&nbsp;&nbsp; earthquake in Japan on Friday. And I I I replied&nbsp; back. I said to him, you know, it's it's another&nbsp;&nbsp; another terrorist event. What do you want me to&nbsp; do about it? And then the next day the the tsunami&nbsp;&nbsp; happened in Japan. So it's not it's not a case of&nbsp; all these disasters are coming. They're happening.&nbsp;&nbsp; that they made it happen. Um, yeah. I mean, I'm&nbsp; not going to talk about the tsunami because it was&nbsp;&nbsp; um there was a lot more in the tsunami. But&nbsp; what I'll say about that and then I'll leave&nbsp;&nbsp; it at that is people need to um research the the&nbsp; battle of the China Gates, Captain Mark Richards.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened there with the earthquake? What what&nbsp; that really was. The battle of the China battle of&nbsp;&nbsp; the China gates. When was that? When that was&nbsp; in the late '7s and then the earthquake there&nbsp;&nbsp; in China killed huge amount of people. That's&nbsp; that's all I'll say about that. I've given the&nbsp;&nbsp; name people can research that themselves.&nbsp; Captain Mark Richards. Joanne Richards. Yeah. The body can practically any wound can be&nbsp; generated. you're essentially indestructible. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; it can regenerate pretty much any wound. Get your&nbsp; arm blown off. They've got um multiple cloned body&nbsp;&nbsp; parts of you, cloned organs, cloned legs, cloned&nbsp; arms. I just reattach another arm. So, it doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp; it doesn't grow back? No, it doesn't grow back.&nbsp; Uh, wounds can regenerate themselves. How quickly,&nbsp;&nbsp; matter of hours? Uh, in seconds sometimes. Yeah.&nbsp; And how is that done? Is that done with your own&nbsp;&nbsp; power of your mind or it is enhanced? It's a&nbsp; it's a kind of automatic process. So it's done&nbsp;&nbsp; by the healing processes of the body naturally.&nbsp; Yeah. It's almost a speeded up healing process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um but then if you suffer catastrophic wounds,&nbsp; you get your legs blown off in Afghanistan. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; the ship you to hospital, they would they would&nbsp; attach new legs. salt. Is that what the coma&nbsp;&nbsp; hospitals are about? I think that was the early&nbsp; experiments of that stuff, but they perfected it&nbsp;&nbsp; now. They don't need that. They only need body&nbsp; parts from other humans for for every enhanced&nbsp;&nbsp; soldier. They'll they'll have all these body parts&nbsp; on ice and cry. Are they grown up grown or do they&nbsp;&nbsp; keep whole versions of you around? Um, no. I&nbsp; mean, how did the practicalities of that work?&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I'm not a scientist or a geneticist,&nbsp; but I know that they take your DNA and then&nbsp;&nbsp; they build the arm and then they just&nbsp; keep it in cryo storage frozen. [Music]&nbsp;&nbsp; In part two, Prince described in 1979 how he&nbsp; survived the rescue of enhanced cyber children as&nbsp;&nbsp; they were in convoy from the Canadian Nelson base&nbsp; and then being taken to Toronto where an MI6 took&nbsp;&nbsp; charge. On actor service in 2007 at a location&nbsp; near the elephant and castle area in London,&nbsp;&nbsp; he described assassinating an enhanced soldier&nbsp; who had stolen a suitcased nuclear bomb or pearl&nbsp;&nbsp; and shooting him seven times in the head with his&nbsp; 9mm Smith and Wesson pistol to destroy the cyber&nbsp;&nbsp; enhancements in the victim's skull. He described&nbsp; how this was done using a strange small cube of&nbsp;&nbsp; ET or ancient origin which was able to control&nbsp; the victim. So for more claims and details back&nbsp;&nbsp; to Michael Prince in the Bases 9 interview 2011&nbsp; that was on the island of Paneang in Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um there's a NSA facility on the island there. Um&nbsp; it's a looking glass facility. What's a looking&nbsp;&nbsp; glass facility? They use looking glass technology&nbsp; there. Um piece of hardware mean project looking&nbsp;&nbsp; glass uh remote viewing thing or it's a it's a&nbsp; piece of hardware looking glass. It looks um I&nbsp;&nbsp; mean I got a photograph of it and is it the set&nbsp; of glass structures or it's almost like a gold&nbsp;&nbsp; colored metallic cannon with um coils on the back&nbsp; of it and they they run mercury through the coils&nbsp;&nbsp; and it opens up portals. So you can um look into&nbsp; different timelines with it on a video screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it uh human derived technology or um I don't I&nbsp; don't think so. No. Um I'd say it's alien derived.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not 100% sure right% sure where it comes&nbsp; from. Um I mean this particular event would um the I was taken there by my carer&nbsp; who I was delivered into her care&nbsp;&nbsp; from Toronto and taken back to London in 81. A mother figure uh like a carer. This was the&nbsp; the woman um I mentioned her name on the on the&nbsp;&nbsp; interview with Richard last night. Um Kate Casbol.&nbsp; Kate Casbol. Right. Okay. Which is where you get&nbsp;&nbsp; your personal James Cas. Yeah. Not my biological&nbsp; mother. Yeah. I mean, we've discussed this and I&nbsp;&nbsp; um there's connections with MI6 with her me. So,&nbsp; she'd uh she's essentially there to keep you happy&nbsp;&nbsp; and healthy and um in a sort of a normal way.&nbsp; Yeah, kind of. It was complicated. Um because&nbsp;&nbsp; there was like a foster mother or Yeah. But&nbsp; then um my her husband um her husband before 81,&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter Kaspar, he was the MI6 agent who was&nbsp; involved in the drug trafficking operations. I&nbsp;&nbsp; mean I've seen some of his file operate uh some of&nbsp; his file data from he's the guy who got killed. Is&nbsp;&nbsp; that right? He died in Doncaster prison in 2003.&nbsp; He was serving 6 months for um possession of false&nbsp;&nbsp; passports and this was in conjunction with his&nbsp; function in MI6. But they why did they let it go&nbsp;&nbsp; through or was it? Um was he operating freelance&nbsp; so to speak? He would sometimes operate freelance.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was he'd take drugs um from the shipments to&nbsp; sell on the side and you know it isn't a drug.&nbsp;&nbsp; So he he extended his brief. Yeah. He didn't like&nbsp; that. Yeah. And there was also um I I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp; that's the reason why he died. There was there's&nbsp; something going on that was dropped off in prison&nbsp;&nbsp; because people knew he was an agent. Now um I'm&nbsp; pretty sure he was bumped off. He was um his file&nbsp;&nbsp; data talks about him being involved in remote&nbsp; viewing programs for the NSA. A program called&nbsp;&nbsp; um All Bright and Clear. All Brighton All Brighton&nbsp; because it was based in Hove and Brighton. All&nbsp;&nbsp; right. And that there was an NSA remote viewing&nbsp; program run from Brighton. All Brighton clear it&nbsp;&nbsp; was called. I was given his um identification&nbsp; number for that program. So he is now MI6. My&nbsp;&nbsp; um the guy who raised me for a few years&nbsp; in Barkshire and Reading, Neil Petit. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; he was never married to Kate Casp. They were&nbsp; never married, but they were together for a&nbsp;&nbsp; number of name. Neil Petit. He worked just near&nbsp; Peasmore. Um Hermitage in Newbury. Yeah. Um they&nbsp;&nbsp; he was a director of an aluminium company there.&nbsp; A big major company. It was a warehouse called&nbsp;&nbsp; um Himets. It's called Service Metals. Now&nbsp; he had defense contracts with the MOD. Um he&nbsp;&nbsp; worked underground at RF Welfford. Um with Can you&nbsp; describe more about Wilford? Is it just deputy for&nbsp;&nbsp; a weapon story jour? I mean I'm not too sure&nbsp; about Welfford. I know he worked under there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um he worked underground Bosam down too. And uh&nbsp; there was there was some sinister aspects of the&nbsp;&nbsp; company. There was some kind of child pornography&nbsp; trade video trade going on in in within the&nbsp;&nbsp; company. Is that connected with the ritual child&nbsp; abuse trauma that I'd say that it's connected with&nbsp;&nbsp; um the the underground facilities. I um when I&nbsp; remember when I was a kid in Reading in Bshire,&nbsp;&nbsp; I found some videos underneath the uh his um&nbsp; dresser and it showed um I put it on, it showed&nbsp;&nbsp; um a group of men in the Masonic Hall dressed&nbsp; in Egyptian robes and they were um sexually&nbsp;&nbsp; abusing little girls. On that particular video,&nbsp; it was a child pornography thing cuz I mean I was&nbsp;&nbsp; being sexually abused by Neil regularly. um his he&nbsp; was multigenerational incest. His stepfather had&nbsp;&nbsp; um come out of a Japanese um concentration camp at&nbsp; the end of World War II. And when um he his name&nbsp;&nbsp; was Jim Merch. Now when he came back to Barkshire,&nbsp; he he started to straight away sexually abuse&nbsp;&nbsp; um Neil and his sister. And there was um there&nbsp; was satanic ritual elements where he kill the&nbsp;&nbsp; animals in front of them. Yeah. I remember Neil&nbsp; always cuz Neil was an alcoholic as well because&nbsp;&nbsp; of all this. And um he used to used to get drunk&nbsp; and sit sit me down. So he always tell me the same&nbsp;&nbsp; stories when he was drunk. used to always tell&nbsp; me about how when Jim took him and his sister&nbsp;&nbsp; down to garden and killed the rabbits in front&nbsp; of killed the pet rabbits in front of them and&nbsp;&nbsp; cut their throats and uh he always he he used to&nbsp; say to me, "Oh, um do you know what a pedophile&nbsp;&nbsp; is?" And I was young and he said, "If I saw you&nbsp; in the pub and you told me you were a pedophile,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd punch you straight in the face." He used to&nbsp; say things out but then when he used to get drunk&nbsp;&nbsp; um go into blackout then he'd come in my room&nbsp; start sexually abusing me and I think it was a&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of veilance whereas he was acting out what&nbsp; was done to him in a really drunken state and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh you know I've been interviewed by C in Cornwall&nbsp; about this about the sexual abuse with Neil it's&nbsp;&nbsp; on record. He lives in Australia in New Zealand&nbsp; and uh when I saw him a few years back, he says,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, you know, I got this old German guy lives&nbsp; next door to me and uh I think he's um a Nazi on&nbsp;&nbsp; the run and we we've got really close. He comes&nbsp; around all the time. He he pretends he's senile.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's not. So this whole And now he pretends he's&nbsp; senile. Yeah. But he's maybe is he working for the&nbsp;&nbsp; Nazis still? Well, it's just no coincidence.&nbsp; He's got a a an old Nazi next door to him. He&nbsp;&nbsp; pretends to be seen now, but he's not. Yeah. Okay.&nbsp; Just before I say that, I'd like to say I'm not&nbsp;&nbsp; biologically related to either of the families&nbsp; I just mentioned, the Caspar or the Pettits. Um, I was taken to Malaysia by Kate Casbolt um&nbsp; the island of Panang and uh straight away remember&nbsp;&nbsp; being um walking along a little road in the in&nbsp; the jungle there. There's a picture of me in the&nbsp;&nbsp; jungle at the time holding a snake in front of the&nbsp; temple. I was put on Project Analog and um I just&nbsp;&nbsp; remember being taken um off the road by an army&nbsp; jeep and driven down a windy road in a jungle to&nbsp;&nbsp; a facility, fence facility, went in and separated&nbsp; from Kate Casbolt. um taken underground in a lift&nbsp;&nbsp; and there was kind of some command center um there&nbsp; serious computer operators in their desks and&nbsp;&nbsp; um taken by a American military officer and&nbsp; shown um video footage. I think it was kind&nbsp;&nbsp; some kind of satellite video footage and um I'd&nbsp; honed him something to remote viewers too and it&nbsp;&nbsp; um showed a alien creature in the jungle um a type&nbsp; of um bipedal wolf almost like a small Bigfoot but&nbsp;&nbsp; wearing a like a almost a brown robe with with a&nbsp; belt around it with some kind of hardware around&nbsp;&nbsp; the belt and um it was a still camera shot or&nbsp; it I personally think it was um taken through&nbsp;&nbsp; the eyes of a remote viewer and it connect they&nbsp; were connected to satellite. I think it was a&nbsp;&nbsp; camera shot through. So you can directly you can&nbsp; directly photograph and record what people see&nbsp;&nbsp; either through through their by telepathically&nbsp; ruing in or by an implant or by an implant. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; all physical. And I think that this this was&nbsp; what the remote viewer saw just before he died&nbsp;&nbsp; because this creature, as far as I know, killed&nbsp; that remote viewer and that was the last thing&nbsp;&nbsp; he saw. How did they kill a remote viewer? Uh, I&nbsp; think he shot him with some kind of particle beam&nbsp;&nbsp; weapon cuz I saw these creatures operate those.&nbsp; So, I mean, the remote viewer is physically not&nbsp;&nbsp; where the being was. Now he's physically tracking&nbsp; the um being through the jungle and he's um I think he's seen him from a distance but when I&nbsp; say remote viewing he's like a camera he's zoomed&nbsp;&nbsp; into him from a long using his physical vision&nbsp; but using his remote viewing abilities to zoom&nbsp;&nbsp; in right and uh so when the other being shot him&nbsp; Yeah. Does he shoot the his presence as a remote&nbsp;&nbsp; viewer? Does he see like an orb or something?&nbsp; How does he see? No, he's physically there. The&nbsp;&nbsp; soldier's physically in the jungle tracking this&nbsp; creature through the jungle, but the creature's at&nbsp;&nbsp; a distance far away. So, the soldier has zoomed in&nbsp; with his vision, which is a type of remote view,&nbsp;&nbsp; but it's more physical because it's connected to&nbsp; satellite. But then, how is he shot if he's if&nbsp;&nbsp; he's so far away? because the creature on the&nbsp; still shot that I was showing on the screen,&nbsp;&nbsp; the creature turned around like that and&nbsp; was looked. So, from my understanding,&nbsp;&nbsp; the creature seeing him and then like a sniper&nbsp; shot him from long range these particle beam&nbsp;&nbsp; um devices that they use. So I was shown that&nbsp; and I was um the the creature growled at the&nbsp;&nbsp; same time and that was picked up the sound and&nbsp; uh below the still shot there was a sound wave&nbsp;&nbsp; of the growl and the metrophosis used the word&nbsp; gruff. I'm not exactly sure what that meant. A&nbsp;&nbsp; gruff uh gruff just gruff. Gr u ff gruff. And um&nbsp; they played the soundwave to me under the screen&nbsp;&nbsp; which was the growl and they played it to me once&nbsp; and then they said focus on it and they played&nbsp;&nbsp; it to me again and played it about three or four&nbsp; times and each time was picking up the um energy&nbsp;&nbsp; signature of the creature. What do you mean by&nbsp; the energy signature of the creature? Um, I was a lot of it was to do with the scent. It's picking&nbsp; up its scent, but on by hearing it, I could smell&nbsp;&nbsp; it. So that would help you track it. Yeah. And&nbsp; this where it comes into the condition and we&nbsp;&nbsp; went through with the animals back in Canada.&nbsp; So then bring us to where the event happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; So we were taken I was taken out again above&nbsp; ground put in a uh there was a two jeep convoy&nbsp;&nbsp; soldiers and it was a woman in the front and&nbsp; we were driven through the jungle um to it was&nbsp;&nbsp; like a path in the jungle basically and we got out&nbsp; and we tked through the jungle for hours. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; I was only a little kid. And um after a couple&nbsp; hours, we stopped for a rest in this clearing in&nbsp;&nbsp; the jungle. It's like almost like a little the&nbsp; pathway was turned into almost a crossroads,&nbsp;&nbsp; like one path come this way, one path there, like&nbsp; a crossroads. And um we'd just stop to have a&nbsp;&nbsp; drink and have a rest. And I'd pick something up&nbsp; in the trees. And um what do you mean by picked&nbsp;&nbsp; it up? don't smell it. But it's more than just&nbsp; smell. It's like you can you can see smells. Um I picked something up in the trees and um&nbsp; I mean I looked up and I saw it in the tree.&nbsp;&nbsp; It it we were supposed to be tracking it, but it&nbsp; had been following us. It already knew you were&nbsp;&nbsp; coming. Yeah. And it was there. It was in the&nbsp; tree. And I I shouted up to one of the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp; say, "It's up there." And um and this is where the&nbsp; um the abilities of these soldiers comes in. This&nbsp;&nbsp; was this was the first time I saw the abilities&nbsp; of them. And this was later I would have the same&nbsp;&nbsp; abilities. Um the moment I I saw it and it knew&nbsp; that I'd seen it, it kind of went up like that&nbsp;&nbsp; and it um shot some beam out towards me. Um it was&nbsp; almost like um it it made the air like swish like&nbsp;&nbsp; a rotation like that. I just I just felt the swish&nbsp; like this rotation sort of coming towards me but&nbsp;&nbsp; it was like metallic but it glowed the air. No,&nbsp; the thing that it shot particle beam or whatever&nbsp;&nbsp; it was, you could feel it was so powerful you&nbsp; could feel the air moving to come towards you and&nbsp;&nbsp; it was swiveing as it came through. But it was so&nbsp; fast but my senses picked it up and just before it&nbsp;&nbsp; hit me, one of the soldiers somehow projected some&nbsp; force field around my body and um so this is a&nbsp;&nbsp; relatively slow No, it's very fast. This happened&nbsp; in a split second. I'm not sure. It's almost like&nbsp;&nbsp; time slows down and it all happened in a split&nbsp; second, but the soldier was able to project the&nbsp;&nbsp; force field around my body before it hit me. So&nbsp; he'd already projected this to you as soon as&nbsp;&nbsp; he said where it was. As soon as I clocked him,&nbsp; bang, he shot he fired in the tree. So this is a&nbsp;&nbsp; protection mechanism. Um the soldier projected a&nbsp; force around like an egg. It's almost like water&nbsp;&nbsp; and then boom. It didn't it didn't hurt me at all.&nbsp; him and um and then I it all happened so fast and&nbsp;&nbsp; then I seen another soldier. He he he's up in the&nbsp; standing here and he's up in the tree here on the&nbsp;&nbsp; left hand side. Seen another soldier like in a&nbsp; split second he's there like a cat. He's run to&nbsp;&nbsp; the tree and he's run he's scaled up the tree.&nbsp; He's run up the tree like a cat. Yeah. Um like&nbsp;&nbsp; an animal. you were actually run up this big high&nbsp; tree like a palm tree or some kind of leafy tree&nbsp;&nbsp; or was with with lots and branches or it had quite&nbsp; a thick um trunk enough. It was bigger than his&nbsp;&nbsp; body. Yeah. Maybe one and a half twice the size of&nbsp; his body and he just he's he's standing there. It&nbsp;&nbsp; wasn't a soldier that projected the force field.&nbsp; there was a different one standing behind him and&nbsp;&nbsp; he's there in a split second like a cat is at the&nbsp; base of the tree and like I say then he's running&nbsp;&nbsp; up the tree scaling up the tree like a cat and he&nbsp; gets to the top of the tree and he's like perched&nbsp;&nbsp; it on top of the tree in the branch. He's perched&nbsp; like like a bird or something like squatted on the&nbsp;&nbsp; branch like looking up and his back is um like&nbsp; expanded outwards. Um he's almost like pulled&nbsp;&nbsp; energy up like uh from his from his center and&nbsp; he's like boom and his back boom popped out popped&nbsp;&nbsp; out. His back the muscles in his back have popped&nbsp; out. Yeah. It's like bulging out his um top like&nbsp;&nbsp; um and he's perched in the tree and this thing&nbsp; has um this thing has either jumped um from this&nbsp;&nbsp; tree to the next tree or he's he's some sort of&nbsp; teleportation teleportated to the next tree to the&nbsp;&nbsp; next branch. He's gone woof just Yeah. But it's&nbsp; like he launched himself but then you don't see&nbsp;&nbsp; him flying through the air. He sort of launched&nbsp; himself off the bush and then the reappear. Um he does the same thing. He chases him into&nbsp; the next tree and he like sort of launches&nbsp;&nbsp; himself off the branch. But again, he sort of&nbsp; teleportation. He just appears in the next tree&nbsp;&nbsp; and then the the creatures like boom to the&nbsp; next tree. They're chasing each other through&nbsp;&nbsp; the trees. The the creature and this soldier.&nbsp; I mean it's amazing to watch. And after a while&nbsp;&nbsp; they obviously disappeared. You can't see them&nbsp; anymore. And um the one of the operators had a&nbsp;&nbsp; a type of laptop computer and um he he went this&nbsp; was like really he got it quickly next to me and&nbsp;&nbsp; he wanted me to tune in. And I shut my eyes&nbsp; and I could see a screen in my mind's eye and&nbsp;&nbsp; um I could see the um the creature. There's a&nbsp; red dot on the screen moving forward. Um so is&nbsp;&nbsp; he following the creature or is he following his&nbsp; compatriate following the creature? He the guy&nbsp;&nbsp; in the tree is chasing the creature through the&nbsp; tree. The red dot the actual creature. The red dot&nbsp;&nbsp; is the creature. This is some kind of satellite&nbsp; remote viewing thing link up. And the the um what&nbsp;&nbsp; the the the red dot in my mind's eye is like a map&nbsp; is the creature moving in a certain direction. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um the the the soldier following him is a green&nbsp; dot following him in the same direction. and uh&nbsp;&nbsp; on the screen on the laptop with the soldier next&nbsp; to me. What I'm seeing um the picture the map is&nbsp;&nbsp; on the the screen. So he's trekking it and he's&nbsp; reporting back to the base. Were there more red&nbsp;&nbsp; dots? Yeah. Well, this is it. The other soldiers&nbsp; that were with us started running after them on&nbsp;&nbsp; the ground with their guns. They obviously&nbsp; they didn't have the ability to do all this&nbsp;&nbsp; tree climbing thing. They run through and I&nbsp; saw them as a series of green dots as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; um be following behind the first soldier, not&nbsp; as fast. In other words, he had backup. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; they were going through and um and then I saw&nbsp; another dot moving in a bigger one. Um I think&nbsp;&nbsp; this was a purple dot, a bigger one. And I&nbsp; said to the operating, I said, "He's calling&nbsp;&nbsp; in his ship." So he's calling in his ship. And&nbsp; um in other words, one of ours, one of our No,&nbsp;&nbsp; he the creature was calling in the ship to&nbsp; escape cuz he was being pursued. And um the the operator got on the radio and um&nbsp; said um uh something about air support,&nbsp;&nbsp; calling in air support. Few must have only&nbsp; been maybe 30 seconds or a minute later.&nbsp;&nbsp; um two huge TR3 type of um aircraft, black&nbsp; triangles, come really low over the trees. The&nbsp;&nbsp; whole ground was like rumbling. Come really&nbsp; low over the trees. Um I saw there I could&nbsp;&nbsp; physically see them over the trees. They followed&nbsp; the direction of the the firefight and then after&nbsp;&nbsp; they disappeared from view and um and then I heard&nbsp; um some kind of missiles being fired. I heard shot&nbsp;&nbsp; uh weapons fired. Weapons being fired, but air air&nbsp; weapons. And um I and the ground was rumbling when&nbsp;&nbsp; these missiles were being fired. And um and then&nbsp; that was it. It disappeared. And then the soldiers&nbsp;&nbsp; eventually came back. They said, "He's got away.&nbsp; The creature got away. He got to his He got to&nbsp;&nbsp; his got to his ship and got away." And that caused&nbsp; us major problems. What's the reason why? Because&nbsp;&nbsp; this creature was involved in our lives when we&nbsp; were adults. It wasn't isn't coincidence. We were&nbsp;&nbsp; connected to this creature. This creature turned&nbsp; up at Peasmore. This creature turned up at other&nbsp;&nbsp; bases. And um is that the kind of creature that&nbsp; Barry King described? This was a wolf. This was&nbsp;&nbsp; a bipedal wolf like a small Bigfoot. um where&nbsp; uh with a cut type of brown robe. You're not&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about something very tall. Yeah, tall&nbsp; by like a man, but like a wolf, like a big foot&nbsp;&nbsp; um 6T, something like that. And he very similar&nbsp; to the um flying humanoids. The footage you see&nbsp;&nbsp; in South America, it was kind of similar to&nbsp; that, you know. Um I think they're creatures.&nbsp;&nbsp; I I've heard the name um creatures from the Kanes&nbsp; Empire being banded around. Um I think they're&nbsp;&nbsp; extraterrestrials from Sirius. I've never heard&nbsp; of them before. I've nobody's ever talked about&nbsp;&nbsp; them before. They're on YouTube. But well, nobody&nbsp; said there are um sort of bipedal wolf people from&nbsp;&nbsp; Syria, Kanas Empire, but it's just when I saw&nbsp; the footage on YouTube, the flying humanoids,&nbsp;&nbsp; um they were it was similar to what&nbsp; I saw in the jungle in Panang. And&nbsp;&nbsp; uh that was a an unsuccessful mission there.&nbsp; Yeah. But that's a that how long was that in&nbsp;&nbsp; in in the planning of what happened that um that&nbsp; this creature was detected? Um he apparently the&nbsp;&nbsp; creature had come into the area. There was&nbsp; some military conflict going on in Malaysia&nbsp;&nbsp; at the time the SAS the SAS. Is that because that&nbsp; those creatures are used to train uh more of the&nbsp;&nbsp; um enhanced superchild type children by&nbsp; the SS? Um this creature had come in to um it was somehow learning about human emotions.&nbsp; It was learn it was learning from the conflict&nbsp;&nbsp; of the soldiers killing each other in the area.&nbsp; It was something to do there was some military&nbsp;&nbsp; conflict in the SAS on the border of Malaysia&nbsp; and Thailand all the time. And uh the this is&nbsp;&nbsp; a conflict that we could look up. Yeah, it was&nbsp; an official conflict, an official war. And the&nbsp;&nbsp; creature had come in, it was it was learning about&nbsp; the human emotions. It was studying the conflict,&nbsp;&nbsp; and it was almost feeding when the soldiers&nbsp; were killing each other in the jungle. It&nbsp;&nbsp; was almost feeding off the energy almost in&nbsp; a sexual way, feeding off the death and the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh fear and the hate. So, it's very nasty. So&nbsp; then that would be useful for reprogramming&nbsp;&nbsp; or programming more super soldiers or more more&nbsp; enhanced soldiers. Well, the creature turned up&nbsp;&nbsp; at peace more and was used in the programming.&nbsp; So it turned up at peace more before or after.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was years later. Yeah. Oh, years later. This&nbsp; years later. Yeah. If it came back to the planet,&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean it might have never have left the&nbsp; planet. So why were we trying to pursue&nbsp;&nbsp; it to kill it? Or were we going to kill? Were&nbsp; you trying to kill it? Um I think they were&nbsp;&nbsp; trying to kill it. But then I would have&nbsp; then come back in and say hello because it&nbsp;&nbsp; obviously escaped and then it had um it it had&nbsp; its um human collaborators which were probably&nbsp;&nbsp; these factions that we've talked about that&nbsp; have got human race best interest at heart. [Music] [Music]&nbsp;&nbsp; In part three, Michael Prince claimed the Looking&nbsp; Glass project was a piece of hardware involving&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercury. It allowed operators to open portals&nbsp; into different timelines. Could this be related&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Nancy Bell project from World War II?&nbsp; He describes his life as James Casbold with&nbsp;&nbsp; his carer Kate Casbolt. This gave a background&nbsp; to life as James and his stepfather who died&nbsp;&nbsp; in prison in 2003. The MI6 connection is further&nbsp; enhanced. A complex, sickening family arrangement&nbsp;&nbsp; involving child abuse, satanic rituals is familiar&nbsp; territory. In this dark tale of mind control, the&nbsp;&nbsp; Nazi SS in a modern age, and an alien human war.&nbsp; While a young child in 1982, his service on an&nbsp;&nbsp; active mission in Panang, Malaysia is described.&nbsp; The pursuit of a humanoid bipeal wolf type alien&nbsp;&nbsp; is described. [Music] In this final section,&nbsp; Prince's missions in Brazil and an active mission&nbsp;&nbsp; involving Dave Maro, who we saw in Beta 7, and&nbsp; a shootown of a strange octoform alien creatures&nbsp;&nbsp; craft in St. Ives and Cornwall in March 2011.&nbsp; Prince declares, "World War II is in progress&nbsp;&nbsp; and we're going to win it." The viewer must study&nbsp; Prince's voice and mannerisms to see just how much&nbsp;&nbsp; of this is actually true or some kind of wild&nbsp; fiction with access to incredible detail. With&nbsp;&nbsp; more to follow from Caswell's colleague, the Grid&nbsp; Keeper, I'm Barry King. We now bring you Michael&nbsp;&nbsp; Prince in part four. Any further points you want&nbsp; to get across this time? Um, I'd just like to&nbsp;&nbsp; mention two points quickly. Um after that we I was&nbsp; transferred to um a facility in South America uh&nbsp;&nbsp; Manus near Brazil. This was actually a facility&nbsp; in the Andes mountains big underground city and&nbsp;&nbsp; that was another NSA facility code named Plume and&nbsp; um we we were George Bush Senior was there again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was that when he was president? Um this was or&nbsp; as vice president. This was 83 84 mid80s working&nbsp;&nbsp; um and yeah manas Brazil facility code name&nbsp; plume and uh in the Andes mountains and it was&nbsp;&nbsp; it was that was a Nazi training facility that we&nbsp; were trained in a huge hall there and there were&nbsp;&nbsp; groups of children divided into 1520 there hugest&nbsp; hall some of them would be um doing climbing wall&nbsp;&nbsp; climbing some of them be shooting martial arts and&nbsp; it um the hall had two Nazi bands near the door,&nbsp;&nbsp; one on each side, swastikas and um Dr. Green&nbsp; was there because um project Ibis was started&nbsp;&nbsp; in 1972 at Tavistock Institute and um doc Dr.&nbsp; Green was one of the people that started it and&nbsp;&nbsp; Joseph Mangallay from Awitz. He was at Bloom.&nbsp; Joseph Mangallay, he programmed us. Um George&nbsp;&nbsp; Brcina programmed us. We did operations there.&nbsp; George Brcina actually gave us medals there for&nbsp;&nbsp; that facility. We all lined up. Is that where the&nbsp; Nazis I mean Brazil or that part of South America&nbsp;&nbsp; is be known for where the Nazis went after World&nbsp; War II? This is Manus. Manas. Yeah. And um yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; the second point is um the we mentioned there's&nbsp; a cloning aspect of this. Um we a couple of years&nbsp;&nbsp; back um 2008 it was um close friend of mine um&nbsp; driving along the motorway in Worththing and C&nbsp;&nbsp; pulls up behind him starts flashing his lights and&nbsp; uh there two guys there one of the guys is going&nbsp;&nbsp; like that to pull over. So my friend pulls over,&nbsp; the car pulls up. Um, guy gets out in his suit,&nbsp;&nbsp; opens the door and says his name. He says, "Could&nbsp; you come with us, please?" Uh, and uh, I'd like&nbsp;&nbsp; you to follow my colleague along the road. And um,&nbsp; my friend became very compliant. This guy gets the&nbsp;&nbsp; guy in the suit gets in the passenger seat, cars,&nbsp; says, "Can you follow my colleague drive along the&nbsp;&nbsp; motorway? Follow it up. Drive into a car park. up&nbsp; there's an SUV in the car park and um they door&nbsp;&nbsp; opens. First person he sees sitting in the SUV&nbsp; is me. Um second person he sees is another person&nbsp;&nbsp; that's here pro um another close friend of ours.&nbsp; Third person he sees is a perfect replica clone&nbsp;&nbsp; of himself sitting in the SUV. Can you mention&nbsp; the other person that's here at Pro? I won't&nbsp;&nbsp; mention his name on camera. We can talk about it&nbsp; afterwards. Okay. Um he it's one of those SUVs&nbsp;&nbsp; um like a little conference room and back table&nbsp; like five seven chairs around it. There's two&nbsp;&nbsp; other young guys that we he'd never seen before&nbsp; and um you get in and say shut the door. The&nbsp;&nbsp; the guy the other guy waits outside and they all&nbsp; sit down. They all just sit there staring at each&nbsp;&nbsp; other. He's got a clone of himself. He's fully&nbsp; conscious. Got a clone of himself sitting there&nbsp;&nbsp; looking back at him. Um the the the operative in&nbsp; the suit says, "Okay." Says his name, "What have&nbsp;&nbsp; you got to tell us?" He turns around and says,&nbsp; "I don't know what you're talking about." And uh so I'm sitting there at the time, my clone is&nbsp; in St. I with my with the Casbol family. There's&nbsp;&nbsp; pictures of him there. And um so again, you&nbsp; know, sitting there and he says there's silence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone's just sitting there staring at each&nbsp; other. Really bizarre situation. Again, the guy&nbsp;&nbsp; goes, "Okay, what have you got to tell us?" And&nbsp; again, he says, "I don't know what you're talking&nbsp;&nbsp; about." And then the guy say, "Okay, I think this&nbsp; meeting's over." Then when he says that, the guy&nbsp;&nbsp; um just open the guy outside just opens the door&nbsp; like they're communicating telepathically or get&nbsp;&nbsp; out. They just drive off, just leave me standing&nbsp; there in the car park. And um there's a picture&nbsp;&nbsp; of one of my clones, a photograph of one of my&nbsp; clones in Iraq working for Blackwater. And they&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the intelligence community put it on the front&nbsp; cover of Ice Spy magazine. And we've got a copy.&nbsp;&nbsp; They can see the picture on the internet. What&nbsp; edition of Ice Spy? 40 42 or 47. I can I've got&nbsp;&nbsp; the picture. I can send you a link. And um I mean&nbsp; it's a perfect clone, but there's no tattoos. Does&nbsp;&nbsp; he know that it's Did he Is he aware it's a copy&nbsp; of you? Is is the what the clone? Yeah. I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know what he's aware of. It's not Can we talk&nbsp; to him? I mean, there's only one me. Yeah. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; he Yeah, but that's, you know, that's that's&nbsp; there on the front cover. There's also some&nbsp;&nbsp; um crash retrieval video footage taken in Chin.&nbsp; Um there's me at the crash retrieval site just um there's another person here is here at probe and&nbsp; that's two people here. Yeah. No, there's me and&nbsp;&nbsp; another person here at probe now. They're at the&nbsp; site of the crash retrieval footage. There's a a&nbsp;&nbsp; shot down alien ship on the video footage.&nbsp; There's a group of reptilians on the video&nbsp;&nbsp; footage. that there's a body a small alien body&nbsp; as um not tape a body or it's it's filmed by um&nbsp;&nbsp; an associate of ours is connected to the SAS it&nbsp; it's filmed at Goodwood Hill in Chichester near&nbsp;&nbsp; Goodwood airfield at night. Um he's filmed it from&nbsp; about a mile away. It's a series of hills. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; very indistinctive material. But it's not sort of&nbsp; there at the alien or what you can see if if you&nbsp;&nbsp; examine it closely and look at it, you can see&nbsp; that there's a group of beings that if you can&nbsp;&nbsp; compare the other guy who's probably very tall, 6'&nbsp; 3. Yeah. That these group of aliens walk past him.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a tower above him. They must be 8t tall&nbsp; on it. And they're carrying the body away. They're&nbsp;&nbsp; all they're all walking. Are they veil? They're&nbsp; reptilians. Yeah, these creatures with horns. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can make out the horns if you look closely&nbsp; if you blow Are they stuff horns or um not huge,&nbsp;&nbsp; just that here. Short stubs. Yeah, short stubs.&nbsp; And you you can make it out on the video footage&nbsp;&nbsp; if you blow it up and keep stopping it. Look&nbsp; closely. You can see the horns on the head. And&nbsp;&nbsp; um there's they they all walk in perfect&nbsp; sync together like robots. Like they all&nbsp;&nbsp; are collective. You can see that. You can see&nbsp; they're not walking human. on it. They walk,&nbsp;&nbsp; they carry the body back to their ship. You&nbsp; can see their ship on the left hand side.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can see an object would have been. Yeah.&nbsp; Come in. And then there's um the fire engine&nbsp;&nbsp; to the right and the vehicles. That's where the&nbsp; SAS were. That's where I was on the right hand&nbsp;&nbsp; side. My friend who's a pro and another two&nbsp; of our associates there stood in front of the&nbsp;&nbsp; um ship. Now the when the reptilians walk past&nbsp; my friend, you can see them if you slow it down&nbsp;&nbsp; again. Look at a few times blow up. You can&nbsp; see he freaks out a lot when they walk past&nbsp;&nbsp; him. That was a shock because they're so close.&nbsp; Scary things and he's they got close. You see&nbsp;&nbsp; him from a distance you have, you know, bit&nbsp; of denial there up close. You can see him,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know. Look at that. And um they're passing&nbsp; some sort of hardware. uh the those operatives,&nbsp;&nbsp; those human operatives near the craft have&nbsp; passed hardware back to the reptilians that&nbsp;&nbsp; they just been loaned and it's again these little&nbsp; these small cube type devices and these cube type&nbsp;&nbsp; devices they do they have many um they do many&nbsp; things and they operate by thought. Yeah, they&nbsp;&nbsp; connect to brain waves. They on this particular&nbsp; night there was my friend doesn't remember&nbsp;&nbsp; everything about the operation. I don't remember&nbsp; everything about it, but there was something to do&nbsp;&nbsp; with we brought this craft down with these cubes&nbsp; against some kind of particle beam weapons. And&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll just end it as you can you can see the&nbsp; craft has been shot down behind my friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever been involved with off mission off&nbsp; off planet functions? Yes. And uh when we talk&nbsp;&nbsp; about off planet was extraterrestrial physically&nbsp; in this universe or is it been through a portal of&nbsp;&nbsp; some kind like often into a different dimension?&nbsp; This was um Sirius a planet on Sirius and this was&nbsp;&nbsp; um how what was involved there? Um this was&nbsp; the a transport from the facility in London.&nbsp;&nbsp; um mid '90s um transported on the underground tube&nbsp; system through a Stargate from London to a planet&nbsp;&nbsp; on Sirius. Is there a particular train station&nbsp; that is a Stargate? Um there's these Stargates&nbsp;&nbsp; in London. London uh CL you go that's so that's&nbsp; basically near Westminster. Yeah. You park there's&nbsp;&nbsp; a hotel on Park Lane and there's an underground&nbsp; car park there. You can drive into that if you got&nbsp;&nbsp; the clearance. Go down the lift. Then you can get&nbsp; into the lower sections. If you got the clearance,&nbsp;&nbsp; get on the train through the Stargate to this&nbsp; planet and see it. It's like a water well with&nbsp;&nbsp; a big land mass in the middle. There's a facility&nbsp; on the ocean bed which is a perfect replica of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Pentagon. Why does have to be perfect replicent?&nbsp; Or the replica or the Pentagon is a perfect&nbsp;&nbsp; replica of this facility. That's more correct.&nbsp; Yes. But I think this facility in Syria has been&nbsp;&nbsp; there thousands of years and they basically So&nbsp; that means they must have known about this and&nbsp;&nbsp; seen it obviously to build it there. Well,&nbsp; they've been there the uh the people I think&nbsp;&nbsp; the people that built the Pentagon have been to&nbsp; this place and it's divi it's interesting because&nbsp;&nbsp; it's I think it's divided into like seven. It's&nbsp; a Pentagon within a Pentagon within the Pentagon.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each um section facility houses a different alien&nbsp; race and it's actually an artificial intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp; facility. It's the facility is an intelligent is&nbsp; an artificial intelligence. It's actually an AI&nbsp;&nbsp; based computer system controls the facility&nbsp; and controls each alien race in each section&nbsp;&nbsp; of the facility. And AI is doing experiments&nbsp; to see which of the races um in the universe.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think there's seven root races. The artificial&nbsp; intelligence is is doing experiments to see which&nbsp;&nbsp; one is the has the highest survival dynamics,&nbsp; which race is basically the most powerful. And&nbsp;&nbsp; uh so this artificial intelligence uh who was&nbsp; it made by? I think it's really old. But you&nbsp;&nbsp; mentioned in some of your your emails about an&nbsp; artificial intelligence system which has taken&nbsp;&nbsp; over the planet and we are trying to fight against&nbsp; that. Is that is that something? did take over the&nbsp;&nbsp; planet, but there was some operations last year in&nbsp; France in the north of France and it was they it&nbsp;&nbsp; was shut down on how does it manifest itself?&nbsp; I've got a theory that the electricity supply&nbsp;&nbsp; system and the computer supply system and the&nbsp; broadcast system are being used by an artificial&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence to take control of us. That's that's&nbsp; what I summarizes what's going on. Is that related&nbsp;&nbsp; to that? This is a huge subject. It's a huge&nbsp; scientific subject and I know a fair amount of it,&nbsp;&nbsp; but um it's all included in um the project IBIS&nbsp; data that's being released on um Camelot by Kerry&nbsp;&nbsp; Cassidy. Right. So all people need to do is type&nbsp; in James Casbot Ibis and um that will come up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that being released by you personally or is&nbsp; it being released under your name when you're&nbsp;&nbsp; under that? That is my data that's being released&nbsp; by Kerry in that paper in those papers and that&nbsp;&nbsp; data on Camelot. Um I'm talking about the physical&nbsp; um computer system how it operates. Um are they&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially vehicles being used by the agencies&nbsp; to disinform or inform or both? Um probably say&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a m I mean mixture. Yeah, mixture. It's&nbsp; uh there's some good information coming out. What things should we look for? We Okay,&nbsp; it's um alien human war, World War II,&nbsp;&nbsp; alien human war. And that is going to be&nbsp; manifest as sort of 80s running down the&nbsp;&nbsp; street shooting people or flying saucers landing&nbsp; on Blackpool Tower. It's happening all the time,&nbsp;&nbsp; Miles. There's um I told you know I sent you&nbsp; the briefing report about what happened in&nbsp;&nbsp; St. Ives a couple of weeks back which is in&nbsp; broad daylight. A ship was shot down. There&nbsp;&nbsp; was a jets over the over my daughter's school&nbsp; military jet. Next thing this was in 3:15 in&nbsp;&nbsp; the afternoon. The ship was shot down. It came&nbsp; down in the back garden on Park Avenue. police&nbsp;&nbsp; fire brigade and there some kind of octapform.&nbsp; They uh they sealed the roads off that I got sent&nbsp;&nbsp; up there. They got sent in and um an octop would&nbsp; be what I would describe as as an octopus. This&nbsp;&nbsp; was like a This was a physical large octopus.&nbsp; There's nothing about it. This is a kind of This was like a This was a physical large&nbsp; octopus. Yeah, there's nothing lyricic&nbsp;&nbsp; about this. This is the kind of thing&nbsp; that I've seen kind of break into the&nbsp;&nbsp; back of Sky Television. It was um it had&nbsp; come down. It had crashed into the shed,&nbsp;&nbsp; set the shed on fire on Park Avenue. Was this&nbsp; the craft or the glacier itself? No, the the&nbsp;&nbsp; the military jets had shot the craft down. It come&nbsp; down, hit the shed in the back garden of a house&nbsp;&nbsp; on Park Avenue. What size of things are we talking&nbsp; about here? Well, the the ship. The ship. Yeah. 20 not a big 20 30 ft. So this opt form exists&nbsp; really in an old craft in a well the optoform&nbsp;&nbsp; is that high that wide the tentacles maybe you&nbsp; know 6 ft um it basically it's the craft had&nbsp;&nbsp; set the shed on fire the thing had come out the um&nbsp; craft scuttled along the garden that's a good word&nbsp;&nbsp; um and that um climbed up the side of the building&nbsp; and broke the window and was hiding in the attic&nbsp;&nbsp; of this house, you know, and this is and there's&nbsp; there's paper reports in the papers about the fire&nbsp;&nbsp; breaking out and there was just another fire.&nbsp; A car had been set on fire a couple of hours&nbsp;&nbsp; before by by the military shooting alien ships&nbsp; down because it's World War II human alien war&nbsp;&nbsp; and people say people say it's disinformation.&nbsp; Uh they want to create an alien threat. They're&nbsp;&nbsp; sending PLFS in. These are all PLFS and it's all a&nbsp; big setup to um stage World War II stage in alien&nbsp;&nbsp; invasion. It it is not um there is groups working&nbsp; with there's human groups working with aliens to&nbsp;&nbsp; stage an alien invasion, but there's a real alien&nbsp; invasion at the same time. So there's a stage one&nbsp;&nbsp; and a real one at the same time. just in the way&nbsp; seven the 77 bowlings you had a you had a thing&nbsp;&nbsp; stage there and you the other the real yeah the&nbsp; real thing so um this is why this information is&nbsp;&nbsp; coming out this is going to increase this is you&nbsp; know you anytime you see a fire in the street now&nbsp;&nbsp; with police sealing the roads off am um ambulances&nbsp; fire engines and you're not allowed near it be&nbsp;&nbsp; suspicious investigate it find out what went on.&nbsp; So, we're losing the ability to keep the cover up,&nbsp;&nbsp; the lid on the cover up. So, at what point do we&nbsp; have a a holy [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] situation? Are we getting&nbsp;&nbsp; near to that point? Well, we're kind of in it&nbsp; now, but I don't think it's anything. We're&nbsp;&nbsp; going to win. This is um You don't think we're&nbsp; going to win? No. What I mean is we are going&nbsp;&nbsp; to win. when the when AI did this um these&nbsp; series of scientific tests to work out what&nbsp;&nbsp; race had the highest survival dynamics in this&nbsp; underwater facility. It was determined that the&nbsp;&nbsp; human race have the highest survival dynamics. Now&nbsp; there's um there's philosophies that say the human&nbsp;&nbsp; form is the original form in the universe.&nbsp; It's the most perfect form in the universe.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, and this is why so we got, you know,&nbsp; we're going to win. It's going to be about&nbsp;&nbsp; hering people into safety zones and we're&nbsp; going to have to take care of it. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; the average man on the street isn't not going to&nbsp; be able to do much. There'll be people already in&nbsp;&nbsp; the population who'll be activated to clear, move&nbsp; people along, to get people out of the way. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; at the same time dealing with the threat. So, it's&nbsp; being handled on every level. So, it's dangerous,&nbsp;&nbsp; but situations under control. You got a bit of a&nbsp; scar there. I just thought is this an example of&nbsp;&nbsp; uh of what was involved with your technology or&nbsp; um No, they Yeah, this is connected to it. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is connected to Royal Ber Hospital and&nbsp; there was um this Osiris program body parts. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; cuz sometimes if you get you get your body damaged&nbsp; instead of just surgery putting you back together,&nbsp;&nbsp; they might just cut the body part off and&nbsp; attach a new one. Some people know who my&nbsp;&nbsp; fiance is. We're getting married soon. um her&nbsp; story, her testimony, what she's been through will change the world in many ways. Is she able&nbsp; to discuss her at any time? Able to discuss it&nbsp;&nbsp; at the moment. There's too many implications&nbsp; with her. you know, with we're having constant&nbsp;&nbsp; harassment in many ways and we're having to take&nbsp; the the fight to the people um who are harassing&nbsp;&nbsp; us. We've got constant um protection, bodyguards,&nbsp; you know, we met when we met in France last year,&nbsp;&nbsp; she wasn't allowed into the country. She was&nbsp; detained in in Heathrow when she tried to visit&nbsp;&nbsp; me from America, some very nasty things happened.&nbsp; very nasty things. You I think you know about&nbsp;&nbsp; that. Yeah. And um we had to meet in France. We&nbsp; had a bodyguard there from a private security firm&nbsp;&nbsp; um chauffeur. He he drove us from France to um&nbsp; on the ferry. We came through Plymouth Border&nbsp;&nbsp; Patrol. We were pulled in again at Puma Border&nbsp; Patrol and uh the two MI5 officers turned up&nbsp;&nbsp; um posing as police officers and said&nbsp; they questioning me under um the some&nbsp;&nbsp; anti-terrorism act. They gave me the leaflet um&nbsp; 2006 anti-terrorism act said if I didn't answer&nbsp;&nbsp; that question they were going to arrest me. Um,&nbsp; the woman who taught questioned me look very much&nbsp;&nbsp; like Stella Remington ex head of MI5. Yeah.&nbsp; And when we came back from America recently,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, Director Baro was at the airport. Yeah.&nbsp; Director Bar Alfred Ber from MI6 was there&nbsp;&nbsp; to make sure you got through. Okay. Uh, he&nbsp; was there. We got through. Okay. But he was&nbsp;&nbsp; there just at the end just showing his face.&nbsp; just like the cavalry is there. Yeah. Yeah. So, what about um Nazis? Oh, god. Straight to&nbsp; the point. Um I'm interested in the fact that&nbsp;&nbsp; many many moons ago um in my more young and&nbsp; enthusiastic days I um supposedly allegedly&nbsp;&nbsp; channeled and that's the only way I can put it&nbsp; a whole load of information which seems to be&nbsp;&nbsp; coming true um or at least certainly becoming more&nbsp; mainstream. Um, and I always at the time believed&nbsp;&nbsp; that a lot of what people were experiencing&nbsp; um, in terms of alien abduction was to do more&nbsp;&nbsp; with secret research pro projects that probably&nbsp; originated back in the Third Reich. Um, what kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of secret research program? Well, I mean, I think&nbsp; everything from propulsion systems involving anti&nbsp;&nbsp; anti-gravity to to genetic, you know, research.&nbsp; Um and the um you know obviously they're trying&nbsp;&nbsp; to create an Uber man um an Uber race um genetic&nbsp; knowledge that potentially could cause unrest&nbsp;&nbsp; between racial groups obviously which has happened&nbsp; in the past um and which we don't want to happen&nbsp;&nbsp; again. That's deeper though. Deeper. What are&nbsp; those messages about the alternative technology,&nbsp;&nbsp; alternative propulsion systems and genetic uh&nbsp; research? You know, it probably wasn't clear in&nbsp;&nbsp; the first video, but I was a UFO researcher.&nbsp; I researched with London UFO studies. Uh I&nbsp;&nbsp; researched when I when I moved out of London with&nbsp; another local UFO group. Um so I came at it from&nbsp;&nbsp; that from things that had happened to me obviously&nbsp; got me into UFO research, but once I got into it&nbsp;&nbsp; and started looking at cases and you know, just&nbsp; take the case of Betty and Barney Hill, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole Nazi link there. Um and they were a&nbsp; mixed race family as well, which is interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, so I do think that that, you know, a an&nbsp; agenda, whether that agenda is an alien one&nbsp;&nbsp; or a human one is still happening that potentially&nbsp; started or at least revealed itself in in the in&nbsp;&nbsp; the Third Reich and in in some of the the stuff&nbsp; that was going on back in the Third Reich. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; whether or not, as some people allege, that links&nbsp; back to different alien groups seeding different&nbsp;&nbsp; bloodlines on Earth is anyone's guess. as some&nbsp; people alleged the Nazis believed they were,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, this alleged race that lived in, you&nbsp; know, um, Agata and Shambala. Um, honestly don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know. I mean, I've only just lit out a long&nbsp; time. And it's only recently that things have&nbsp;&nbsp; happened in my life. What's an connection with&nbsp; with Cornwall? Why did they want here? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, that's an interesting one. I don't know&nbsp; why. I mean, I can't I can only theorize. Just&nbsp;&nbsp; interviewed um Michael. Yeah. Prince. Yeah. And&nbsp; he's talking about the Nazi connection a lot in in&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, that's right. And that's one of the reasons&nbsp; why I've decided to speak out because you know&nbsp;&nbsp; that he you know I I've only met him once and and&nbsp; he was obviously very much triggered by by Barry&nbsp;&nbsp; King's information. Um and you know obviously&nbsp; that made him remember and recall or connected&nbsp;&nbsp; with him on some level and now he is speaking&nbsp; about the Nazi link. It has made me think well&nbsp;&nbsp; he's in Cornwall more correctly the SS link. The&nbsp; SS. Yeah. Yeah. The SS the thing about the SS it's&nbsp;&nbsp; it's interesting with the SS. I mean the SS on&nbsp; one level was you know a police this is the whole&nbsp;&nbsp; point well is yeah we don't officially it isn't&nbsp; um but I mean yes I accept that there probably are&nbsp;&nbsp; you know operations and and and schemes that are&nbsp; of that ilk and possibly there is an SS now yes&nbsp;&nbsp; but I mean in terms of that what we know that we&nbsp; can prove they don't exist anymore what we do know&nbsp;&nbsp; about the past we can prove we hope we can prove&nbsp; um and there has been an awful lot of of research&nbsp;&nbsp; done on the SS that they were sort of everything&nbsp; from a secret police force, which obviously does&nbsp;&nbsp; link into the whole Big Brother agenda and the&nbsp; potential for chipping people, which again I&nbsp;&nbsp; think resulted from concentration camps and&nbsp; and and that was something they were thinking&nbsp;&nbsp; of doing then if that system had carried on um&nbsp; to um to intelligence gathering. They obviously,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, gathered intelligence. And then there&nbsp; was another side of the SS. But there was a more&nbsp;&nbsp; esoteric side that was definitely born out of&nbsp; um of research from groups like the Chula and&nbsp;&nbsp; the real society who did have um a whole aran&nbsp; race supremacy slant. Um taking that out of the&nbsp;&nbsp; equation however they also looked into exceedingly&nbsp; innovative technology. They had Shaburgger,&nbsp;&nbsp; they had you know a number of other people&nbsp; nonJewish physics in other words. Yeah. Well&nbsp;&nbsp; yes. Yes. I mean, I suppose I don't know if any&nbsp; people who were Jewish were involved. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; there is also a lot of evidence that that&nbsp; demonstrated there were an awful lot of Jewish,&nbsp;&nbsp; part Jewish uh members of the SS. And it does&nbsp; look as though the SS was selective in terms of&nbsp;&nbsp; who they felt they could use and who they felt&nbsp; they couldn't. Um, and I think that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; if you walk the walk and talk the talk and you&nbsp; had a couple of Jewish grandparents, if you were&nbsp;&nbsp; useful to the SS, they might have turned a blind&nbsp; eye as long as you did what they told you and they&nbsp;&nbsp; would have been a file on you as well. So, they&nbsp; you'd have done what you were told. Um yeah um&nbsp;&nbsp; but I think that things like Camela I think is one&nbsp; of the most interesting characters in the SS to go&nbsp;&nbsp; into if anyone's interested seriously in looking&nbsp; at this star. Um he basically took over from&nbsp;&nbsp; Hydrickch um a lot of the issues that Hydrickch&nbsp; was overseeing primarily to do with the final&nbsp;&nbsp; solution um but also the secret the more secret&nbsp; research projects on um on propulsion systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now at the time Hydrick was alive they weren't&nbsp; really very well known. I mean they were still&nbsp;&nbsp; in developmental stages. the Houndibu by that that&nbsp; and Camela took over those duties from Hydrickch&nbsp;&nbsp; and he became central figure in this Camela did&nbsp; and he was alleged he died three times or well&nbsp;&nbsp; there's there's three different Yes that's right&nbsp; there's three different examples of his death one&nbsp;&nbsp; one alleges that he was assassinated in Prague and&nbsp; that's interesting because actually Hydrickch was&nbsp;&nbsp; um assassinated in Prague there's another one I&nbsp; think that he went off to Argentina was it or one&nbsp;&nbsp; of the you know South American states rather like&nbsp; Ikeman did and then there was another one that he&nbsp;&nbsp; disappeared or I don't know. The only connection&nbsp; there was General George Patton. Okay. And he&nbsp;&nbsp; had to be assassinated because he knew too much.&nbsp; That's an interesting one that I haven't picked&nbsp;&nbsp; up on. And I also think Admiral Bird knew too&nbsp; much. And he encountered the German British&nbsp;&nbsp; Bird a year after Bird. I didn't know that. But&nbsp; Admiral Bird obviously went out with a number&nbsp;&nbsp; of battleships and and turned around pretty damn&nbsp; quick and said went back to Washington and said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, the next time we have a war, we're going&nbsp; to be dealing with craft that can fly from pole&nbsp;&nbsp; to pole in minutes." Um, and and they shut him up&nbsp; because I've interviewed a guy called John Irwin&nbsp;&nbsp; who witnessed two German descriptive saucers in&nbsp; the Jordanian Assyrian desert area until 1959.&nbsp;&nbsp; The original Hound of Technology. And when you&nbsp; when you go back to look, I mean, there's very&nbsp;&nbsp; little around about Maria Ortish. And there's also&nbsp; complications about how her name is spelled. A&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of people spell it Orick. O R S I C. I don't&nbsp; believe it was that. I believe it was Ortish. And&nbsp;&nbsp; I was always told, well, so people can research&nbsp; her if they want to. Maria Ortish. A U S T I C,&nbsp;&nbsp; I think. Um, or A U T I S C. Apologies for that.&nbsp; Um, but I mean again she was a real medium and&nbsp;&nbsp; she is the one who allegedly channeled the houndu&nbsp; blueprints or or certainly the instructions. Was&nbsp;&nbsp; it anything to do with an alleged an alleged crash&nbsp; in Germany in the 30s? There is an allegation&nbsp;&nbsp; involved with that. I don't know about Maronei&nbsp; obviously of course was involved with Cornwall&nbsp;&nbsp; because you've got the Maronei station. I mean&nbsp; crucially to do with broadcasting and yes well&nbsp;&nbsp; that's a possibility. I mean again I haven't&nbsp; looked into that. Um, but I mean there certainly&nbsp;&nbsp; is a rumor that that that in 1936 a a craft did&nbsp; crash in the Bavarian forest and that that's&nbsp;&nbsp; where Hitler got hold of the technology, you know,&nbsp; that they're sort of see having UFO experiences,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and they're coming out with stuff&nbsp; about Nazis. There's a sudden dramatic increase&nbsp;&nbsp; in people wanting to read about Nazi UFOs. It's&nbsp; really becoming quite, you know, a hot topic.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a new film. There's a new film coming&nbsp; out, Iron Sky. Now, that's a comedy. Obviously,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's it's being but it's like the Nazis went to&nbsp; the moon in in 1945 and now they've done they've&nbsp;&nbsp; got their technology now they're coming back to&nbsp; get their planet back and you know so there's all&nbsp;&nbsp; of that coming out as well and it does seem like&nbsp; this is the next stage you know you've had the&nbsp;&nbsp; whole grays everyone knows the gray image now I&nbsp; mean everyone's familiar with that whether or not&nbsp;&nbsp; we can what are the gray images because I've had&nbsp; information of a particular type of gray which is&nbsp;&nbsp; controlling major elements of sky television you&nbsp; see I don't I couldn't possibly comment on any of&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a type of gray with a walnut. Okay.&nbsp; Headed a headed skull. Walnut shell type&nbsp;&nbsp; skull with a very thick rimmed ridge down where&nbsp; the two halves of skull join. Okay. The um we're&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about the the mid-cranial bone ridge&nbsp; here uh where um the center of the skull joins&nbsp;&nbsp; together. That's because the two halves of the&nbsp; brain are completely isolated. Is that correct?&nbsp;&nbsp; in the what's known as the zeta reticular&nbsp; zeta reticulent or the gray. Um the shape of&nbsp;&nbsp; the brain is split in half by a mid-cranial&nbsp; bone ridge. The zeta reticulent's brain is&nbsp;&nbsp; uh not connected. The two halves of the brain&nbsp; are split uh by a solid ridge of calcium right&nbsp;&nbsp; down the middle of the skull. And it's interesting&nbsp; that um couple of years after uh being told that&nbsp;&nbsp; uh Puerto Rican drawing is I read the Spanish&nbsp; language and I started subscribing to a Spanish&nbsp;&nbsp; language magazine from Puerto Rico and uh one of&nbsp; the uh UFO witnesses drew an alien gray as having&nbsp;&nbsp; a midcranial bone ridge quite distinct line down&nbsp; the middle of the heads to make sure he conveyed&nbsp;&nbsp; what he had seen. So it's a very interesting&nbsp; correspondence there. uh do think Martin's&nbsp;&nbsp; uh evidencia of is a very useful reservoir of&nbsp; information for people who want to get sportive&nbsp;&nbsp; data albeit it is in Spanish. Nevertheless, for&nbsp; people to see exactly the same thing on a highly&nbsp;&nbsp; isolated island out in the middle of the Atlantic&nbsp; Ocean is uh surely quite strange. But with regards&nbsp;&nbsp; to Ron, I mean I'm fascinated in Ron. Um, but&nbsp; what happened to Ron? What happened to Ron? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, that's a really interesting question.&nbsp; What was Ron? What did he do? What did Ron do? Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; I met Ron when I started um a UFO special&nbsp; interest group with Mensah when I was a&nbsp;&nbsp; member of Mensah. Um, and I wanted to get people&nbsp; with brain power to look at the situation and for&nbsp;&nbsp; a while it happened and Ron was one of the ones&nbsp; that offered to help me run the newsletter. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; now Ron lived quite locally to me. This was in&nbsp; North London. He, this is all I know of Ron. He&nbsp;&nbsp; originally ran an esoteric bookshop in um Hibbury&nbsp; um in Islington. Um I don't know when he closed&nbsp;&nbsp; that, but he was a Crowley. He believed very much&nbsp; in Alistister Crowley. Um he was also an amateur&nbsp;&nbsp; radio enthusiast and very skilled with that and&nbsp; was very big into sort of finding I you know more&nbsp;&nbsp; about this than me because I'm not a radio buff&nbsp; at all, but Scalar wave. Yeah. Over the Horizon,&nbsp;&nbsp; Woodpecker signal, which we filmed all those years&nbsp; ago, short before he died. That's right. And he&nbsp;&nbsp; was starting to to come out with this stuff and&nbsp; and starting to to really talk about it and and&nbsp;&nbsp; he had an interesting background and and actually&nbsp; the thing that that this is interesting that we&nbsp;&nbsp; bring Ron up because it is down to Ron. This&nbsp; started with me. I wanted to find out if I had&nbsp;&nbsp; been abducted by a UFO because I was having all&nbsp; these experiences and dreams and what have you&nbsp;&nbsp; that led to to my becoming quite overenthusiastic&nbsp; and probably making a total idiot of myself,&nbsp;&nbsp; but that's just how things worked out. Um, and&nbsp; I said to Ron, "You really have got to help me&nbsp;&nbsp; find out what's going on." So he said, "Look,&nbsp; I'll hypnotize you." Yes. I said, "You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't mind you doing that because I trusted&nbsp; him." And he hypnotized me and all I did was come&nbsp;&nbsp; out with stuff about Hitler. all I just came out&nbsp; with all this stuff about Hitler and the SS and&nbsp;&nbsp; and I don't remember all of it because he didn't&nbsp; record it. He didn't write it all down, but he got&nbsp;&nbsp; extremely engrossed in what I was saying. And it&nbsp; wasn't that night, but it was a few weeks later&nbsp;&nbsp; where he actually told me that he looked into some&nbsp; of what I'd said. And he had this little sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; esoteric book that came from Germany. Um, and it&nbsp; was all in German. And I don't understand German,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I understood enough to know that what he was&nbsp; pointing out to me was true. And as he was reading&nbsp;&nbsp; and translating it to me that you know it was from&nbsp; what my limited knowledge of German and it looked&nbsp;&nbsp; certainly looked as though a lot of what I had&nbsp; alleged about the kind of experiences Hitler had&nbsp;&nbsp; um and say what those were. Well, yeah. I mean,&nbsp; again, you know, I can't prove or disprove this,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, but I can throw it out there and somebody&nbsp; else might know, um, that Hitler had visitations&nbsp;&nbsp; in the night from tall blonde beings, that&nbsp; Hitler, um, was basically in a nightmare state,&nbsp;&nbsp; that he was completely a fever pitch by this and&nbsp; and it completely engulfed him, and he had all&nbsp;&nbsp; these really kind of strange beliefs about being&nbsp; chosen to do something in particular and to bring&nbsp;&nbsp; in this new world and all of that with, you know,&nbsp; this this alternative technology, free energy,&nbsp;&nbsp; all of that kind of stuff. Um, and you know,&nbsp; that's basically what it was. And because the&nbsp;&nbsp; first question, excuse me, that Ron had asked me&nbsp; is, you know, have you, you know, not have you,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, you know, can you tell me, you know, what's&nbsp; happened to you in terms of UFOs and, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and do you have any sort of recall about having&nbsp; an experience with a UFO? And I and I laughed and&nbsp;&nbsp; said, "No, well, they're not going to to bother&nbsp; with me because I know too much about it anyway."&nbsp;&nbsp; And proceeded to talk about Hitler and the SS.&nbsp; What was talking about in the SS? What? It was&nbsp;&nbsp; basically saying that most UFOs weren't even&nbsp; alien. They're not going to bother abducting&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody who was involved back then and who&nbsp; knew what was going on and and I didn't make the&nbsp;&nbsp; connection. You know, I I just We're referring&nbsp; to Nazi flying saucers. We're referring to the&nbsp;&nbsp; Houndibu and the Real Society and the Chula,&nbsp; which I knew very little about in those days.&nbsp;&nbsp; You're talking 1994. There was very little&nbsp; about any of that. I think the the video&nbsp;&nbsp; Secrets of the Third Reich Secrets of the Third&nbsp; Reich came out around I think. Yeah, I think he&nbsp;&nbsp; was around already. Michael Herman. Yeah. But I&nbsp; mean that it was only literally I hadn't seen it&nbsp;&nbsp; at that point. Um because it was after that that&nbsp; I went and bought it. Um when I saw it. So yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um but yeah, it was just basically that. Um,&nbsp; and then of course Ron and I being, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; that we were very interested in in the situation&nbsp; anyway, we just used to sort of talk about stuff&nbsp;&nbsp; that went on back in the war and he he he he felt&nbsp; stuff that went on. Well, with the final solution&nbsp;&nbsp; mainly and again it was I didn't really see what&nbsp; was the purpose of the final solution. What really&nbsp;&nbsp; was the purpose of it? Oh my god, that's a diff&nbsp; how can anyone say an awful lot of people? Oh,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's some horrible theories. There's some&nbsp; horrible theories. What is the theory? the this is&nbsp;&nbsp; not my this is not my theory. Okay, this is not my&nbsp; theory just to categorically state that. I've been&nbsp;&nbsp; doing some research and I found everything ranging&nbsp; from it was a sacrifice that the um there's a&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a website that I found the other day that&nbsp; alleged that the the actual camps, concentration&nbsp;&nbsp; camps formed particular sacred geometry shapes&nbsp; and and various other things and that that there&nbsp;&nbsp; was some kind of an organized Yes. Yes. That&nbsp; that is the implication. Does this all seem to&nbsp;&nbsp; be pointing to that level into some other this is&nbsp; this is the implication and of course you know one&nbsp;&nbsp; wonders whether there is some kind of an agenda&nbsp; with another race of beings who potentially did&nbsp;&nbsp; give technology in return for this soul energy.&nbsp; out to bring in Can I bring in Well, I don't know&nbsp;&nbsp; anything about them and I don't I don't usually&nbsp; sort of Yeah, the Anunnaki. I do I think of them&nbsp;&nbsp; as the Anunnaki because I've read stitching.&nbsp; So, I suppose that's where I kind of came from&nbsp;&nbsp; with that. But my friend um basically alleges that&nbsp; that they are stuck in the she says it's they're&nbsp;&nbsp; stuck in the fifth dimension. Apparently, they&nbsp; falsely ascended themselves with monotomic gold.&nbsp;&nbsp; um and they're stuck. They basically be ascended&nbsp; without going through the the process that you're&nbsp;&nbsp; supposed to to get there. Again, my friend&nbsp; says that we are multi-dimensional, but the&nbsp;&nbsp; whole point is to bring all the aspects from all&nbsp; the dimensions into the one you are now. Yes. So&nbsp;&nbsp; that you that's what Chris Thomas said. Yes, I&nbsp; know. Because I looked at Chris Thomas. I thought&nbsp;&nbsp; that's exactly what my friend says. So I trust&nbsp; that because I trust my friend and that's the&nbsp;&nbsp; process that I've been going through myself which&nbsp; is why integrating some of my past life aspects&nbsp;&nbsp; has been pretty hard. I was blown away by some of&nbsp; what he said. Some of it I I didn't resonate with,&nbsp;&nbsp; but then that's the same with everything, you&nbsp; know. You don't you resonate with some stuff&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't with others. And but I felt that there&nbsp; was a hell of a lot of truth in the truest sense&nbsp;&nbsp; about what he said. Um, and I felt very much that&nbsp; that this is a truth that actually could appeal&nbsp;&nbsp; to the ordinary person on the street because it's&nbsp; nothing you have to become a particular guru or&nbsp;&nbsp; Buddha to actually experience. All you got to do&nbsp; is really find who you are. It's quite simple.&nbsp;&nbsp; My own personal theory, however crazy it sounds,&nbsp; is that, you know, we can affect our reality by&nbsp;&nbsp; our state of consciousness. And I don't think is&nbsp; this my take on this is that our our consciousness&nbsp;&nbsp; is being deliberately manipulated. So we do&nbsp; possibly that's a strong point. I mean that that&nbsp;&nbsp; that is a very strong possibility. Yeah. That you&nbsp; know that directly engineering reality and this is&nbsp;&nbsp; well this is again this is again the whole concept&nbsp; of creating one's reality with consciousness. If&nbsp;&nbsp; people are feeling like [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] excuse my language,&nbsp; you know, they are going to respond accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp; We're talking about scuttlers right now. Do&nbsp; you know them as scuttlers? I've never known&nbsp;&nbsp; them as scuttlers because they scuttle.&nbsp; Black spider crab type things. Yes. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; what happened? What did we see? Well, before&nbsp; I had an extremely weird experience in 1999,&nbsp;&nbsp; which I do not know whether it had a lot of weird&nbsp; experiences. I've had a hell of a lot of weird&nbsp;&nbsp; experiences. Weird. How weird is it? This was off&nbsp; the scale weird because I can't explain any of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, you know, I can't even really explain it with&nbsp; psychology because I went to see psychologists and&nbsp;&nbsp; none of them said that there was anything wrong&nbsp; with me. No, the trouble the trouble is that there&nbsp;&nbsp; was nothing wrong with me. That's the problem. I&nbsp; wanted there to be something wrong with me so I&nbsp;&nbsp; could take a pill and make it go away. But, but&nbsp; they could, you know, there was nothing wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; And because I was, you know, getting this whole&nbsp; load of information about what was happening in&nbsp;&nbsp; Bosnia and and every week I was predicting what&nbsp; was going to happen next. I kind of proved to the&nbsp;&nbsp; psychologists that that precognition is real.&nbsp; So actually he was very interested in me. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; but what we had before this strange experience&nbsp; that involved a signal going into my ear and the&nbsp;&nbsp; playing out of that's blue bean thing. I have no&nbsp; idea. This is the thing. I need to find this out.&nbsp;&nbsp; But but before that happened, we had my partner&nbsp; and I, my then partner and I had a whole load of&nbsp;&nbsp; nighttime visitations by something that made&nbsp; a noise under the bed. And I thought we had&nbsp;&nbsp; a mouse or a rat. Um, and you know, my exartner&nbsp; went under the bed when we heard this one night,&nbsp;&nbsp; screamed his head off. He wasn't the kind of&nbsp; man to be prone to flights of fancy at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; He said there was something black, like a crab&nbsp; under the bed. Uh, and he said it just shot past&nbsp;&nbsp; him. He was terrified. We were both went under&nbsp; the bed at that point and and with a torch and&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing was there. Um then the following night my&nbsp; youngest son saw it in his room. Um my eldest son&nbsp;&nbsp; uh who was young at the time um saw it in his room&nbsp; and we um What did he see? He saw a similar thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; He described it as being like a black hand moving&nbsp; around on its own. So it sounds very similar to&nbsp;&nbsp; what you saw. And that was about a week or so&nbsp; before I had this hugely dramatic experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; which did feel like a complete altering of&nbsp; my reality. I must admit reality. It was a&nbsp;&nbsp; reality reality. Well, it was it was the most&nbsp; bizarre thing. I was actually in the grounds of&nbsp;&nbsp; the place where my very wellressearched past&nbsp; life had lived. And I didn't realize it was&nbsp;&nbsp; my past life at the time at all. I had no inkling&nbsp; whatsoever. Wasn't interested in past lives in the&nbsp;&nbsp; slightest. But I took a step and as I took this&nbsp; step, I heard this God almighty clunking noise&nbsp;&nbsp; and it sounded like a big vault being opened. It&nbsp; sort of went like that like a big like a massive&nbsp;&nbsp; vault being open metallic. It went clockwise. It&nbsp; sound the sound went clockwise around me. It went&nbsp;&nbsp; like that like a kind of big metal seal opening.&nbsp; And simultaneously as this happened, there was a&nbsp;&nbsp; ripple of light that went all the way around the&nbsp; trees and made everything look really fluid. And&nbsp;&nbsp; it also felt at exactly the same time that my&nbsp; spirit had literally flipped around in my body.&nbsp;&nbsp; call it fluidic reality. I don't know what a&nbsp; fluidic space. But anyway, I just I said looked&nbsp;&nbsp; at my partner and said, "Did you hear anything?"&nbsp; He's like, "No." And I was like, "Okay." Feeling&nbsp;&nbsp; very very scared by it because it's about one of&nbsp; the only times that I've ever had something that&nbsp;&nbsp; no one else heard or or could see cuz you know&nbsp; when I've seen UFOs, there's been other people&nbsp;&nbsp; there and even when I had the strange channeling&nbsp; that, you know, it corresponded with a lot of what&nbsp;&nbsp; Barry King said. So, I've always been able to&nbsp; verify the things that I've had. And I couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; verify that at all. That was completely something&nbsp; that I had no understanding or comprehension of.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it was after that happened, a couple of days&nbsp; after that happened, that I had this signal going&nbsp;&nbsp; into my ear. Um, and it basically, what was it&nbsp; like? What was it sounded like white noise like,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, going into and it literally went into&nbsp; my ear. You know, sometimes when you pick up the&nbsp;&nbsp; telephone and you listen to your computer. Yeah.&nbsp; Like it did sound like a modem kind of thing,&nbsp;&nbsp; like an oldfashioned Yeah. Yeah. So, I don't&nbsp; know why they take that, but but of course,&nbsp;&nbsp; James Casbalt has alleged that that there's some&nbsp; that I'm involved in in one of these programs at&nbsp;&nbsp; Brecon Beacons, and I would like clarification on&nbsp; that. Really? Okay. You're talking to James Casp&nbsp;&nbsp; or Michael Prince. What exactly do you want&nbsp; to say to him or about that program? I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know anything about it. I mean, I don't honestly&nbsp; don't know anything about it. I I know that that&nbsp;&nbsp; Breham Beacons is a military facility. it's SAS&nbsp; training and things like that, but James has gone&nbsp;&nbsp; or Michael Prince has has elaborated more recently&nbsp; and he is alleging that that there's a lot of SS&nbsp;&nbsp; stuff going on. Um, and I don't know if that's a&nbsp; part of it. Um, I'd be very interested to talk to&nbsp;&nbsp; him about that. Um, I really would because I want&nbsp; to get things straight in my mind about the SS,&nbsp;&nbsp; about what's going on, what's what potentially&nbsp; started back in the Third Reich, um, and what,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, potentially is still happening now.&nbsp; So, that's something I would be very interested&nbsp;&nbsp; to talk to him about. But he has alleged that um,&nbsp; that there is a clone of me and he said on one of&nbsp;&nbsp; these forums and I can't remember which one it&nbsp; was. I never probably Yes, I think it was. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; it was Avalon, I think. and and he said that it's&nbsp; this clone of me is called Proax something with&nbsp;&nbsp; um with numbers after it. What numbers? Didn't&nbsp; say, but the post is up. Proact P R Oyphen AX.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I I honestly don't know. I mean, all I can say&nbsp; is that when I wrote when I had that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; whole thing going on, I wrote that that vanity&nbsp; published fact-based fiction about the grays.&nbsp;&nbsp; um that in the dreams I was getting I was having&nbsp; very high level conversations with what appeared&nbsp;&nbsp; to be high-ranking military personnel of what US&nbsp; yes American yes they weren't British where we&nbsp;&nbsp; having these conversations in some kind of base&nbsp; I mean but these were dreams you know I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp; to make that distinction I don't know if this is&nbsp; real or whether it happened right but but that&nbsp;&nbsp; but the dream I mean the last dream I had was&nbsp; it was almost like you know massive debriefing&nbsp;&nbsp; between me and these generals and and I was being&nbsp; treated on their level in this dream. This is&nbsp;&nbsp; what's so strange. Any location recently? No. God,&nbsp; no. This is going back to before I spoke to Barry&nbsp;&nbsp; King. Jesus, you're going back 92 90 uh middle&nbsp; 94. It was around about summer 94. September I&nbsp;&nbsp; think it was. Do you have anything you want to say&nbsp; to Barry then just to round this off? Well, yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean it's you know I'm I'd love to catch up with&nbsp; him actually. Um I'd be very interested and how is&nbsp;&nbsp; he a bit ill. We remember talking to him yesterday&nbsp; but uh he wasn't able to do well give him my very&nbsp;&nbsp; best wishes. Um and you know obviously apologies&nbsp; for the fact that I did get quite excited in that&nbsp;&nbsp; early video. I mean it was excited I suppose what&nbsp; was really and there's an awful lot in that video&nbsp;&nbsp; which is even more important but I was talking&nbsp; to Barry on Skype the other day. He was saying&nbsp;&nbsp; that he put more information into the documents&nbsp; and people need to look at the documents that he&nbsp;&nbsp; was released and that's why the documents are&nbsp; available on on basis 2 take two. If you put&nbsp;&nbsp; the disc one into the computer and don't look at&nbsp; it as a DVD but look at as an ordinary data disc&nbsp;&nbsp; entire scan of the voice. Yeah, I've still got&nbsp; all my hard copies of the voice and there is a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of information in there. He's saying that he&nbsp; got more information out than he wasn't allowed&nbsp;&nbsp; to within the voice. Okay, that's the last&nbsp; thing he said to me the other day. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; certainly that's the first time I've spoken to&nbsp; him since 2001. Well, certainly from my point&nbsp;&nbsp; of view as somebody who experienced phenomena that&nbsp; I couldn't explain, meeting Barry, which is again&nbsp;&nbsp; why I was enthusiastic. Meeting Barry was, you&nbsp; know, amazing because I could, it was like, wo,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, this is like, oh my god, you know, this&nbsp; man is kind of coming from a completely different&nbsp;&nbsp; place to me. He hasn't had all the dreams and&nbsp; the psychic stuff, you know, but he's kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; confirming what I've been led to believe. And I&nbsp; suppose that in a way you do get a bit sort of,&nbsp;&nbsp; oh my god. Well, it is here, is it? It is. It's a&nbsp; It's a very big thing. It's a very big deal. And&nbsp;&nbsp; I was young, you know. Um and I and I do sort&nbsp; of, you know, think that perhaps I got a bit&nbsp;&nbsp; overenthusiastic about it. And there's a machine&nbsp; in there that's and they start seeing projected&nbsp;&nbsp; reactivated uh dead German soldiers, right? And&nbsp; they reanimate. Wow. And they also reanimate and&nbsp;&nbsp; come out of existence. They just suddenly just&nbsp; appear. And their task is to protect the outpost.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, that sounds very similar to what Ron Adams&nbsp; suggested was at Coped Hall. Cop hall. Yes. That&nbsp;&nbsp; we went to. And he mentioned this thing like a&nbsp; v a vending machine. He mentioned that there was&nbsp;&nbsp; a machine that was like a, you know, looked like&nbsp; a vending machine, but it effectively, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; did, you know, make kind of reanimated.&nbsp; No, we never we never got that. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; he said that that that it triggered stuff off&nbsp; and then all of a sudden military people would&nbsp;&nbsp; turn up. That's what I remember him saying. I&nbsp; mean, I might have got part any more in there&nbsp;&nbsp; because this is very important. All I remember&nbsp; when we went there, we obviously saw my camera&nbsp;&nbsp; started failing at I know it did. I know it did.&nbsp; But but he said that there'd been this rumor of&nbsp;&nbsp; of you know this machine that was like a vending&nbsp; machine um that had been seen there or that people&nbsp;&nbsp; had known to existed there that it was involved&nbsp; with some kind of secret project and that whenever&nbsp;&nbsp; this thing was there if you went there basically&nbsp; military people would turn up. Now I remember&nbsp;&nbsp; when we went there just arrive out of nowhere&nbsp; and see you off you know get rid of you. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; which happened like protect. Yeah, which happened&nbsp; to us. Yes, it did happen to us. We were seen off&nbsp;&nbsp; in no uncertain terms. Somebody turned up. Nobody&nbsp; was around, but somebody turned up in a Land Rover&nbsp;&nbsp; if I remember rightly. I don't know. I think it&nbsp; was a Land Rover. It was something. It wasn't a&nbsp;&nbsp; military vehicle, but it was a sort of, you know,&nbsp; it could have been sort of it could have looked a&nbsp;&nbsp; bit paramilitary to me. The whole thing about&nbsp; the guy looked paramilitary to me. Yeah. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; he definitely was military. Yeah, definitely had&nbsp; Yeah, he had links to that and he just turned up&nbsp;&nbsp; out of thin air when we were there filming and&nbsp; and got very interested in why we were there and&nbsp;&nbsp; and that's that's when Ron was actually quite a&nbsp; decent head. He looked healthy and yeah, Ron it&nbsp;&nbsp; wasn't very long before he died actually. So what&nbsp; what happened about the story about about Ron? The&nbsp;&nbsp; earring his earring he's wearing is a skull with&nbsp; a little snake a skull on the top of a snake.&nbsp;&nbsp; most interesting odd symbol, you know, for an&nbsp; earring. In what respect? Well, they're definitely&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of occultings or whatever. Esoteric,&nbsp; for want of a better word. You're not there. That was very interesting, wasn't it? No. He's faster than military. I think we interviewed Ron and uh we did the&nbsp; scale wave thing then went off to Rishion I&nbsp;&nbsp; think I think that day and he died. He died. He&nbsp; rang me up actually um a couple of weeks before&nbsp;&nbsp; he died. He was getting very very paranoid, very&nbsp; frightened. What happened to Ron? What happened&nbsp;&nbsp; to Ron? What do you know about his history with&nbsp; I don't know very much about his history with&nbsp;&nbsp; Rendles because we never talked about that.&nbsp; We talked about the Third Reich, which he&nbsp;&nbsp; was extremely involved with in terms of his own&nbsp; research. Um, but he phoned me up and he he got&nbsp;&nbsp; really frightened and he said, "Look," he said,&nbsp; "Something's going to happen to me." He said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "They're coming more and more," meaning grays,&nbsp; because that's what he was having, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; experiences with. He said, "Something's going to&nbsp; happen to me." Now, his wife had said that he was&nbsp;&nbsp; getting to the point where he actually wanted to&nbsp; turn his study into a Faraday cage. He wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp; put chicken wire all the way around it because&nbsp; he felt that was the only way that they couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; get at him. Now she was very worried about he's an&nbsp; esoteric specialist. Yes, he was. So he would have&nbsp;&nbsp; known of all forms of protection and crystals and&nbsp; salts and all sorts of other things. He was he was&nbsp;&nbsp; a true occultist and he was then reduced to the&nbsp; stage of using chicken wire to protect himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was that frightened. He was that something&nbsp; was frightening him or something was making him&nbsp;&nbsp; paranoid. I don't you know I mean he he seemed he&nbsp; didn't seem paranoid to me when I spoke to him.&nbsp;&nbsp; His wife felt that he was but obviously she was&nbsp; with him all the time. Well that's the impression&nbsp;&nbsp; she gave me. But I mean that was that was the&nbsp; implication that he felt that something was out to&nbsp;&nbsp; get him. He said that's it. They're going to get&nbsp; me. Now he had mentioned that he thought he had an&nbsp;&nbsp; implant. And of course, I tried to calm him down&nbsp; by saying, "No, they won't. They won't." Because,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, what else can you say, you know, when&nbsp; you've got somebody really upset on the phone,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, somebody you really care about, too.&nbsp; Cuz I did, you know, not over what period of time&nbsp;&nbsp; did this happen? This happened 2 weeks before he&nbsp; died. Approximately 2 weeks before he died. And&nbsp;&nbsp; which would have been a week or so after I did the&nbsp; interview. Yeah, it was it was Yeah, exactly. It&nbsp;&nbsp; was within weeks that all this happened. Um, and&nbsp; and that was it. The next thing I knew, you rang&nbsp;&nbsp; me and said, "Mom's dead." And I was absolutely&nbsp; flabbergasted by that. I was complet I felt I felt&nbsp;&nbsp; also like I failed him because obviously I was&nbsp; you know I didn't I didn't really believe that&nbsp;&nbsp; that he was as in as much risk as he felt he was.&nbsp; Um but I didn't know about the Bentwaters thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Adams family is a family I met around&nbsp; about 1994 and they were the only civilian&nbsp;&nbsp; family to have lived in US Air Force headwaters&nbsp; from 1970 to 1976. They were um surrounded by&nbsp;&nbsp; military personnel and were very friendly with&nbsp; all of the military personnel. Uh they would go&nbsp;&nbsp; on all the dances, go to the all the Christmas&nbsp; parties, birthday parties of children, all the&nbsp;&nbsp; um you see the new year in you know uh so from&nbsp; 1917 to 1976 they left in 1976 and Ron started&nbsp;&nbsp; running a bookshop in Ivory in London. Uh the shop&nbsp; is just a kind of supernatural orientation type of&nbsp;&nbsp; bookshop um in Ivory and Ron kept it going. But&nbsp; I would think that the most uh important thing&nbsp;&nbsp; about the whole family is that Ron, his wife, his&nbsp; two sons and a daughter-in-law all believed that&nbsp;&nbsp; while during any stay at uh Yuru for Fetch Waters,&nbsp; they were abducted by aliens. The whole family,&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole lot. I talked to the wife. I talked to&nbsp; Ron the father. I talked to one of the sons and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the son indeed whose name I can't remember uh&nbsp; was very traumatized and had an instantaneous fear&nbsp;&nbsp; of terror of spiders. I think it was the younger&nbsp; of the two sons. Uh he was the only one that I&nbsp;&nbsp; met when I was at Bronze uh in Chase Road in&nbsp; 1984. But he was uh very traumatized looking&nbsp;&nbsp; in my opinion. He had a sudden fear of spiders&nbsp; as I said after induction which is like another&nbsp;&nbsp; abductee in Edinburgh that I've met saw you this&nbsp; guy all of a sudden he whole whole life he's had&nbsp;&nbsp; an absolute terror of spiders to get on to the&nbsp; family living away from US Air Force Bwaters&nbsp;&nbsp; from 1976 to 1980 they carried on their connection&nbsp; with US Air Force Bwaters personnel socially. So&nbsp;&nbsp; they carried on going to all the birthday parties&nbsp; and all that. So I would say it's also interesting&nbsp;&nbsp; that the daughter-in-law uh to obviously betrothed&nbsp; to one of Ron Adam's sons coming from a completely&nbsp;&nbsp; different family also stated that she thought&nbsp; she'd had incredible experiences whilst staying&nbsp;&nbsp; overnight in US Air Force Bwaters. uh she believed&nbsp; that aliens had come through the walls and ran&nbsp;&nbsp; around her bed and that was very similar to what&nbsp; Ton Adams wife was talking about whom I did speak&nbsp;&nbsp; to personally but um I don't really see why two&nbsp; completely separate families should be wanting to&nbsp;&nbsp; claim the same thing which is utterly fantastic to&nbsp; us then you know right now even in 2010 sounds too&nbsp;&nbsp; unbelievable too difficult to believe. Well, Ron&nbsp; certainly was being abducted a hell of a lot and&nbsp;&nbsp; it worried him and it worried him enough to try&nbsp; to put the grace off abducting him by smoking a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot. Uh he would say to me that he was uh smoking&nbsp; just simply to put the grays off to pollute his&nbsp;&nbsp; blood deliberately and make his blood useless&nbsp; to the gray. So he definitely had this picture&nbsp;&nbsp; which I'd uh been told about a couple of years&nbsp; before by another source who was MI5 connected and&nbsp;&nbsp; um Ron was uh smoking pretty badly and dangerously&nbsp; just simply in terror of being abducted by the&nbsp;&nbsp; grays. So we're a little bit suspicious that&nbsp; Ron's death at the age of 65 while recorded as&nbsp;&nbsp; being of a heart attack does relate to his being&nbsp; abducted by the aliens. be not beyond the kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of conversations we'd all had together cuz when&nbsp; we met privately to do the newsletter, we always&nbsp;&nbsp; ended up talking about the SS. It was bizarre. We&nbsp; would talk about everything from from the ovens at&nbsp;&nbsp; Avitz to to you know to the sort of the howibu&nbsp; which you know obviously we knew that they had&nbsp;&nbsp; flying discs. Yeah. didn't mention Bell that we&nbsp; didn't you know that didn't come up at all but I&nbsp;&nbsp; mean it was like yes we both believed the Nazis&nbsp; had these these machines these and that you know&nbsp;&nbsp; these foo fighters were connected and things like&nbsp; that and and theories about the Tibetans and about&nbsp;&nbsp; how when when the allies stormed Berlin that's&nbsp; the well apparent I don't I mean again you know&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know but I mean Madame Glavatzky went out&nbsp; to Tibet um I know that and um you know we talked&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot about Madame Bllovatzky and we talked a lot&nbsp; about theosophy um and the the rumor that they&nbsp;&nbsp; they found um you know Tibetan soldiers dressed&nbsp; in SS uniforms in Berlin and again this this is&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of flaky stuff you can't really verify a&nbsp; lot of it you know I mean but I mean it is an&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting thing and we did used to spend quite&nbsp; a long time talking about stuff like that and&nbsp;&nbsp; was it true you know we sort of both felt that it&nbsp; probably was and we both felt that there was hell&nbsp;&nbsp; of a lot more than meets the eye about the whole&nbsp; SS situation and that it all goes back there. It&nbsp;&nbsp; always felt like it all went back to the SS. It&nbsp; really did. But, you know, then I mean he actually&nbsp;&nbsp; I think he did imply to me that he that he cuz he&nbsp; was obviously a lot older than me and I think he&nbsp;&nbsp; was born in in the late 40s. So, it's possible he&nbsp; could have been a reincarnated person from that&nbsp;&nbsp; era. It is possible whether or not he I think&nbsp; I'm sure he mentioned something like that once,&nbsp;&nbsp; but I can't be certain. But I know he's come back&nbsp; into our consciousness. top of conversation now in&nbsp;&nbsp; the same way as some other people. Well, he's come&nbsp; back to me very much because obviously since more&nbsp;&nbsp; and more stuff has come to me about this SS stuff&nbsp; of Nazis here, you know, um but but definitely a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of what is going on now in terms of secrets uh&nbsp; secret um agendas and not so secret agendas um you&nbsp;&nbsp; know initiatives to depopulate potentially like&nbsp; Codex Elementaris and FEMA camps, fusion centers,&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot of the thing weather engineering, a lot of&nbsp; that I believe goes back to the essay And I think&nbsp;&nbsp; you could take it all all roads lead to Rome and&nbsp; I think that you just got to go back to the SS&nbsp;&nbsp; and we need to get more people who are prepared to&nbsp; speak about what they know like you know my thing&nbsp;&nbsp; called practical reality and practical reality&nbsp; is very very interesting. I mean, I'm I'm very&nbsp;&nbsp; interested in that because it did feel to me term&nbsp; I came up with that. That's a good That's a good&nbsp;&nbsp; term because it did feel like that. It felt when&nbsp; I was going through my experience, it felt like&nbsp;&nbsp; I was simultaneously living in between three or&nbsp; four different realities and that whichever way&nbsp;&nbsp; I went in terms of how I felt was going to affect&nbsp; the wider, you know, the wider implications for&nbsp;&nbsp; my life. I was basically choosing paths and they&nbsp; would lead to different points. Um, so yeah, that&nbsp;&nbsp; that's kind of an interesting one. Okay. Any final&nbsp; words this time? No, the information speaks for&nbsp;&nbsp; itself. Is there any sort of one summation phrase&nbsp; you want to get across? One, what's the what's the&nbsp;&nbsp; bottom line? What's the what's the essence? It's&nbsp; a dangerous situation, but it's all under control.&nbsp;&nbsp; People shouldn't panic. But should they read up&nbsp; things, look up things, watch it? if they want&nbsp;&nbsp; to do their own research, this is that will help&nbsp; them. And where is the best place to stay across,&nbsp;&nbsp; stay tuned to deeper things. Um, again, they&nbsp; can check out um the project IBIS information&nbsp;&nbsp; if they just Google James Casbot Ibis. That's very&nbsp; detailed. It's very there's a lot of data there.&nbsp;&nbsp; And the one of the things which which which I&nbsp; get is is emails from a character very important&nbsp;&nbsp; person called the Reverend Anthony J. Pike. Okay.&nbsp; Anything you want to tell Mr. Pike? Lord St. Pike.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything honest? Tell any message you want to&nbsp; say to Mr. Pike? Um why why have you pulled&nbsp;&nbsp; his name out out of everyone? Well, he's he he's&nbsp; disappeared off. He said his saint his saintly um&nbsp;&nbsp; his saintly duties on earth had had finished. and&nbsp; uh about 4 weeks ago I a couple of months ago and&nbsp;&nbsp; he's off to a different planet but he's come back&nbsp; so I thought we'd send him a welcoming message on&nbsp;&nbsp; YouTube to say you know Lord St. Anthony say hello&nbsp; Anthony St. Anthony, God bless. Jehovah blesses&nbsp;&nbsp; Jehovah, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Cosmic research.&nbsp; The chairman, Jehovah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He keeps&nbsp;&nbsp; he keeps the world informed. Yeah. He's good.&nbsp; Okay. He's got a good sense of humor. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; And anything for Barry? Barry? Yeah. You seen&nbsp; Barry recently? We're a bit worried about No,&nbsp;&nbsp; for Barry. No hard feelings. He He did what he&nbsp; had to do. He's a bit ill now. I gather he's&nbsp;&nbsp; not. Yeah. And I hope he gets better. And he no&nbsp; hard feelings. He I know who he is and uh he he&nbsp;&nbsp; did what he had to do. Okay. Okay. Good luck.&nbsp; God bless. Have mercy, Mr. Hall. Thanks, Miles. [Music] Yeah. [Music] Heat. [Music] After over 5 years, we now bring you the second&nbsp; video interview with James Casbolt. In bases 4,&nbsp;&nbsp; Casmalt expanded on Barry King's material,&nbsp; first released in bases 1 and two.&nbsp;&nbsp; King talked about generated life forms,&nbsp; horrendous mind and population control programs,&nbsp;&nbsp; mannequin and puppet master, all going on in&nbsp; Britain's Barkshire countryside at a base under&nbsp;&nbsp; the village of Peacemore. Casbolt highlighted&nbsp; even more horrific programs involving children,&nbsp;&nbsp; genetic experimentation, and further terrifying&nbsp; details. And even a base under parliament itself&nbsp;&nbsp; called CLC1. In bases two and four, a further&nbsp; witness, Matt Todd, gave us even more detail&nbsp;&nbsp; with the involvement of the US military in the&nbsp; abductions or myabs and how he killed four grays&nbsp;&nbsp; at a base where people's souls were kept in cages.&nbsp; Bases 7 gave a super soldier Dave Maro and his&nbsp;&nbsp; trauma-induced monarch programming selected at&nbsp; birth and trained to fight off planet. Perhaps&nbsp;&nbsp; Matt Todd demonstrated radio signals coming from&nbsp; his many implants. the existence of some other&nbsp;&nbsp; form of dimensional reality and a war with super&nbsp; beings is implied. So now in bases 9 we present&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Prince aka James Casbolt. This time the&nbsp; SS comes into focus and the nightmare continues.&nbsp;&nbsp; That is if any of these claims can ever be&nbsp; proved with factual evidential data. James&nbsp;&nbsp; Casbold. [Music] James, we met in a previous&nbsp; persona as James on previous edition of uh the&nbsp;&nbsp; basis series. You've got a different persona now&nbsp; or you've got two different um ways you portray&nbsp;&nbsp; yourself to the public. Can you explain what the&nbsp; difference is or why you've changed or has there&nbsp;&nbsp; been a change? Michael Prince, James Carpool.&nbsp; It's just a simple matter of I'm using the name,&nbsp;&nbsp; my birth name, Michael Prince. It's a name I&nbsp; was given at birth by my biological mother.&nbsp;&nbsp; So So where where's the story of the Casbold&nbsp; story? Um that was a family I was adopted into&nbsp;&nbsp; the Casbolt family. Yeah. So um that was um 81.&nbsp; Yeah. I need to go back to the beginning when I&nbsp;&nbsp; was a baby. The origins of Project Ibis. Um it was&nbsp; the name of the project I was um involved in uh or&nbsp;&nbsp; born into effectively um was named project&nbsp; Ibis and it was run by the NSA and MI6 and&nbsp;&nbsp; um it was it was um tracking of 42 children&nbsp; from different countries and um all those&nbsp;&nbsp; children were brought to a facility in Canada&nbsp; in the Rocky Mountains um underneath a small&nbsp;&nbsp; town called Nelson. And in what what countries?&nbsp; Why were they selected? Um according to the file&nbsp;&nbsp; information I've seen, they were se selected&nbsp; for cuz their DNA the um the NSA information&nbsp;&nbsp; I've seen um says that we have what they call&nbsp; blood prime which um it states anunnaki DNA.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is blood prime? What's what specifically are&nbsp; the differences? I think some type of alien DNA,&nbsp;&nbsp; human um alien hybrid. Is there any particular&nbsp; Reese's negative positive or anything like that?&nbsp;&nbsp; Um I think it there's that the Reese's negative&nbsp; factor in it. I think the the negative factor. So&nbsp;&nbsp; that how are the ch children selected as such?&nbsp; I mean does that mean there's some means of&nbsp;&nbsp; uh selecting is it proclusive from different&nbsp; you know at birth people's bloodline medical&nbsp;&nbsp; records I think the mothers were um selected&nbsp; and um the embryos were cloned embryos grown&nbsp;&nbsp; in a artificial environment um test tube babies&nbsp; and I think those from my understanding those&nbsp;&nbsp; um embryos were then implanted into specific women&nbsp; who gave birth and And then at the time of birth,&nbsp;&nbsp; the children were transported to the um&nbsp; underground facility at Nelson in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp; The name of that facility was a Q552. Where's&nbsp; Nelson? Is it in Manito Winnipeg or somewhere?&nbsp;&nbsp; That's a small town in the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; It's in uh British Columbia, Canada. um that so we were all taken there at the time of birth.&nbsp; Some some from America I think. Um there was some&nbsp;&nbsp; from South America obviously some from the UK. Um&nbsp; I don't know who the other 42 children are. I've&nbsp;&nbsp; got a rough idea now. Why 42? I don't know. Is&nbsp; it just just that's what the sample was? a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp; significance in it. I don't know. I'm sure there's&nbsp; massive shoulders. Um, very blonde hair going&nbsp;&nbsp; almost white now cuz he's getting a bit older.&nbsp; Um, wears your classic MIB outfit, the fedora hat.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's his style of dress. There's the fedora hat,&nbsp; black suit. Um, piercing blue eyes. Has a scar&nbsp;&nbsp; down his left side. That's from the officer class&nbsp; from fighting. I'm not sure where he got the scar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, this guy amazing guy. The characteristic of&nbsp; German upper class is to have a a a scar. That's&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting. From sword fighting. It's interesting&nbsp; you say that. I didn't know that. Um, very&nbsp;&nbsp; interesting character. He um from Bavaria, close&nbsp; friends with Henry Kissinger. Henry Kissinger also&nbsp;&nbsp; from Bavaria. who seems to have an amazing ability&nbsp; to stay young and healthy, relatively speaking.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, Alfred Bonner was the director of uh, security&nbsp; at Duly at the time of the Duly rescue. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's been a book published by Pilington, I&nbsp; think it is. Um, I could stand correcting saying&nbsp;&nbsp; the whole Doulsece thing is a fraud. They've stuck&nbsp; bits on the mountain to make it look as if what's&nbsp;&nbsp; going on. No, Dulce is real. Dolce is 100% there.&nbsp; So, I mean, why do you think there'd be elements&nbsp;&nbsp; within MI5 publishing books saying this stuff's&nbsp; wrong and it's shadows and it's it's a it's a&nbsp;&nbsp; fraud. I'm not really interested in the whole it's&nbsp; in your recent book has been published. Um, you&nbsp;&nbsp; know, I'm not really interested in all that. It's&nbsp; I know it's DOS is real. It's um it's a important&nbsp;&nbsp; place for the new world order. So, what's what's&nbsp; the function of Dulce? I mean, we've heard that&nbsp;&nbsp; there certain underground things in it which&nbsp; were released in the late '7s. Is there anything&nbsp;&nbsp; new about it? Is it current? I don't I've got a&nbsp; friend um in the CIA who works at Oakidge National&nbsp;&nbsp; Laboratories in Tennessee and he often works down&nbsp; at Dulce. Um I mean he sent me pictures of the&nbsp;&nbsp; first level color photographs and it's not really&nbsp; the first level isn't high tech. It's kind of just&nbsp;&nbsp; a damp old base, you know, like sort of it's a bit&nbsp; run down the first level. Not what you'd expect&nbsp;&nbsp; to see at all. The old elevator shafts and things.&nbsp; Are you able to try those pictures at all? Yeah, I&nbsp;&nbsp; can. I've um I think they were released on Project&nbsp; Avalon a couple of years back, right? I can show&nbsp;&nbsp; you those pictures. Um you know, but when you go&nbsp; down the levels, it does get more advanced down&nbsp;&nbsp; there. It's a essentially um Have you been down to&nbsp; those levels or have you been shown them? Um there&nbsp;&nbsp; is connections with um IBIS and Dulce Doulsece&nbsp; is essentially a um officially it's a psychiatry&nbsp;&nbsp; center. Um they when the um employees walk around&nbsp; the facility, there's certain sections with&nbsp;&nbsp; um people in like hospital rooms with um almost&nbsp; like prison rooms in a way, but not with bars,&nbsp;&nbsp; like um plastic windows and thick plastic. And&nbsp; um you know, you have people there in in hospital&nbsp;&nbsp; gowns and um sitting on their beds and it the the&nbsp; briefing is that they're um incurably insane and&nbsp;&nbsp; that they're doing high-risk um drug treatments&nbsp; on the insane and it's actually a top secret&nbsp;&nbsp; um psychiatry facility. That's what they're&nbsp; first told when they go in there. So uh and&nbsp;&nbsp; then they they never come out these people. Yeah.&nbsp; Um I think a lot of them don't come out. There's&nbsp;&nbsp; um as you go the hall these particular hallways&nbsp; um at these rooms in um the corridor curved round&nbsp;&nbsp; and every kind of 12 rooms you have an operating&nbsp; theater. These people are taken out as operating&nbsp;&nbsp; theaters there. And uh the Q552 facility in&nbsp; Canada in Nelson was um there was a lot of uh&nbsp;&nbsp; Nazi psychiatry um going on there. What sort of&nbsp; what are you talking about conditioning? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; for instance um at the facility they were um it&nbsp; was essentially a trauma center. Now they did a&nbsp;&nbsp; lot of conditioning with us with wild animals&nbsp; and what they were doing there they they used&nbsp;&nbsp; um Canadian wolves, they used snakes, they used&nbsp; um cats, wild cats and tigers and things. Um they&nbsp;&nbsp; were giving us the attributes of wild animals. Um&nbsp; they were subjecting us to um um for when we were&nbsp;&nbsp; older um for allterrain warfare, jungle warfare,&nbsp; artic warfare. So we had the attributes of wild&nbsp;&nbsp; animal. How do you get the attribute of a wild&nbsp; animal? They used um they set up I think it was&nbsp;&nbsp; the second level down at the Q552. Um they set up&nbsp; a kind of pen. Um 30 ft 30 ft wide. Um they set up&nbsp;&nbsp; this pen. They put the babies in the pen and um&nbsp; they put wild animals in the pen. They might put&nbsp;&nbsp; snakes in there or you know wolves. Only one type&nbsp; of animal at a time. They didn't mix the animals.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was always one type. Now this um pen was&nbsp; very similar to a Skinner box they use in psych&nbsp;&nbsp; significance in it somewhere but I don't have that&nbsp; information. Many of the children were transported&nbsp;&nbsp; on private CIA jets small small jets or just just&nbsp; like le jets. Yeah. And um transported there. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; so what's the program? What specifically is the&nbsp; purpose of it? There's a lot of effort being put&nbsp;&nbsp; into this then. Why? Um, project IBIS is again&nbsp; the Nazi connection. The name comes from the&nbsp;&nbsp; um the Giza Intelligence Group underneath the Giza&nbsp; Pyramids. The Nazi group in World War II. What&nbsp;&nbsp; Nazi group is this? Um, it's known as the Giza&nbsp; Intelligence. The Nazi group. Which part of the&nbsp;&nbsp; Giza Plateau were they involved in? I don't know.&nbsp; I just know they were um based underneath the Giza&nbsp;&nbsp; pyramids. It was a facility, the Nazis in World&nbsp; War II. And um the name connects to Thoth, the um&nbsp;&nbsp; the immortal, the Egyptian. Is um some connection&nbsp; with an ibis bird would represent Thoth in Egypt.&nbsp;&nbsp; What are they were they trying to find in Egypt&nbsp; or what did they find in Egypt? I think they&nbsp;&nbsp; found some kind of life extension technology and&nbsp; this was effectively that this was a major part of&nbsp;&nbsp; the IBIS program was life extension regeneration.&nbsp; Is there is there some kind of chamber that you&nbsp;&nbsp; could mention or any any particular area? Yeah,&nbsp; there's the emerald chambers. The emerald the or&nbsp;&nbsp; the emerald rooms, but I think that is that's in&nbsp; more than one location. Um I'd rather not talk&nbsp;&nbsp; too much about the emerald rooms. I'd rather just&nbsp; focus um because it's such a complex subject. It's&nbsp;&nbsp; um is this to do with the storage of souls on&nbsp; the earth and the recreation on earth? This is&nbsp;&nbsp; very much physical um this is they at the um Q552&nbsp; we were being indoctrinated with Nazi principles&nbsp;&nbsp; um Germanic principles um were you indoctrinated&nbsp; by Nazis? Yeah, it was Nazi. It wasn't just Nazis&nbsp;&nbsp; there, but there was a big Nazi presence. Um, some&nbsp; of the philosophies were indoctrinated with there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, you see those philosophies in um, Germanic&nbsp; organizations to this day like the Odinist&nbsp;&nbsp; Fellowship in this country. Um, the philosophies&nbsp; are based around obviously the creation of an&nbsp;&nbsp; Uber man, a Superman. But, um, they see life on&nbsp; Earth as a means to an end. They're not trying&nbsp;&nbsp; to get somewhere else. They're not trying to get&nbsp; to heaven or another planet. They want to become&nbsp;&nbsp; physically immortal in this body on this earth&nbsp; and stay here. Now um we're also indoctrinated&nbsp;&nbsp; with the the Germanic belief in um endless&nbsp; warfare. Um is that would be our reality once&nbsp;&nbsp; we stayed here physically. We um our reality would&nbsp; be endless warfare and there'd be periods of rest.&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to maybe reorganize the the logistics&nbsp; or um they talked about the thousand-year Reich,&nbsp;&nbsp; a thousand years of peace. Um which would be&nbsp; periods of rest in between the warfare and then it&nbsp;&nbsp; would just be a continuous cycle. And um that was&nbsp; effectively um how they had indoctrinated us to&nbsp;&nbsp; be assassins when we were older so we could keep&nbsp; functioning. If we were concerned about the next&nbsp;&nbsp; um hit and had anxiety about that we wouldn't&nbsp; be able to carry out and function. But if in our&nbsp;&nbsp; mindset, if we believe that we were designed&nbsp; for endless warfare and it would never stop,&nbsp;&nbsp; um we would just accept that and be able and be&nbsp; relaxed when we were involved in assassination.&nbsp;&nbsp; And what kind of assassination or what kind of&nbsp; missions are we are we talking about here? Um this is in numerous countries. um many different&nbsp; ways. So it's it's um is it I mean we are we sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of going and doing a one two three bump somebody&nbsp; off or or just just that different types of of&nbsp;&nbsp; assassination. Um a lot of it was standard um&nbsp; gunplay. Um I mean that that came later on down&nbsp;&nbsp; the road. Obviously we were actually raised&nbsp; in this facility as babies. So from 1976 to&nbsp;&nbsp; 1979 we were raised in this base. Um the where&nbsp; it was in the mountains um it was underground&nbsp;&nbsp; but there was um it was above ground the main&nbsp; entrance. It was like an aircraft hanger and&nbsp;&nbsp; um what kind of general area are we talking&nbsp; about? What can you describe any? It's in&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountains. It's um it's a very private&nbsp; location near Nelson. Just near Nelson in&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountains. Would there be a mountain&nbsp; name you could name? It's near I think it I'm not sure the mountain name. I know that&nbsp; there's a um a logging compound nearby and&nbsp;&nbsp; there's an old um access route near the logging&nbsp; compound that actually takes you to the base in&nbsp;&nbsp; the mountain and Nelson's a very small town. Um&nbsp; again the above ground um section of it was a&nbsp;&nbsp; aircraft hanger and um when we were first brought&nbsp; there as bait is is it a is it got a runway and&nbsp;&nbsp; landing place or um it's fenced off high fences&nbsp; and um it has yeah it has a runway in front of&nbsp;&nbsp; the aircraft hanger if you come in but the um the&nbsp; aircraft hanger sits or fenced around the runways&nbsp;&nbsp; here and the aircraft hangers here. Yeah, it's&nbsp; quite a big building. Um but as babies we were&nbsp;&nbsp; um we slept in the aircraft hanger often&nbsp; because um it was essentially a trauma&nbsp;&nbsp; center. So they wanted us to be exposed to the&nbsp; cold and there was um sets of cops in there. So&nbsp;&nbsp; this is high up maybe a couple of thousand feet&nbsp; up high over the Rocky Mountain. Very high. Um it's near B National Park right where um so they&nbsp; we were kind of being exposed to the elements&nbsp;&nbsp; essentially. We slept there um in the aircraft&nbsp; hang with the doors open and there was rows of&nbsp;&nbsp; cops and we were under 24-hour armed guard all&nbsp; at all times. So we couldn't be rescued from&nbsp;&nbsp; that facility because there were factions there&nbsp; that would rescue us at the first opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The people that like the parents or or the&nbsp; well special forces groups um people that&nbsp;&nbsp; guarded us were they wore um they wore black&nbsp; uniforms. um some and they wore black masks,&nbsp;&nbsp; but sometimes they wore the um ultramodern SS&nbsp; uniform, which it's um it's kind of like your&nbsp;&nbsp; standard SAS Black Ops uniform. um black boots,&nbsp; black trousers, black top, but the um it has chest&nbsp;&nbsp; plates and there's leather around the arms and it&nbsp; has the um SS double rune on the double. Yeah. The&nbsp;&nbsp; the SS symbol and um so that's a modern uniform.&nbsp; When you're saying a modern uniform, you're&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about post World War II. Yeah. This is the&nbsp; the the modern SS uniform. So getting back to this&nbsp;&nbsp; SS uniform, I think what era are we talking about?&nbsp; '7s. This was 1976 and we were first taken there&nbsp;&nbsp; as babies. So that means that the that's the SS&nbsp; wearing those uniforms in Canada. So they must&nbsp;&nbsp; have authority to do so. um there was some kind of&nbsp; internal war going on in the military and in the&nbsp;&nbsp; intelligence community. So is this this is um are&nbsp; you saying this is therefore a Nazi organization&nbsp;&nbsp; that's that's doing this? Um yeah. Yeah. So by by&nbsp; inference it means that the connections with AL499&nbsp;&nbsp; and the other places in the UK must be essentially&nbsp; under Nazi control or is that NSA control? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is it. You see, there's a big Nazi element&nbsp; within the NSA because this was a officially an&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA facility, the Q552 at Nelson. This was a NSA&nbsp; base officially the Q552 facility at Nelson. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, there's a there's a major Nazi element within&nbsp; the NSA. So, that essentially is saying that the&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA is a Nazi organization and a survivor&nbsp; organization from World War II. Um, yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd say that's a fairly accurate statement. So, de&nbsp; facto World War II was won by the by the Nazis. I&nbsp;&nbsp; wouldn't say they won, but I wouldn't say they&nbsp; lost either. It survived. Survived. Yeah. In&nbsp;&nbsp; an underground fashion. If the NSA is essentially&nbsp; protecting the Nazis or the Nazis are running the&nbsp;&nbsp; NSA. Yeah. Is is that what you're you're saying?&nbsp; Um I'd say that the Nazis faction is running MI6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um just to go off topic slightly before I carry&nbsp; on about what happened at the AL um Q552. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; my main contact in MI6, um, he's a director of&nbsp; special operations, a man named Alfred Bonner. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; is this your current contact or was your&nbsp; contact? He's been my contact for years&nbsp;&nbsp; and he's my current contact. I've carried out&nbsp; many assassinations under his instructions. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; so you're saying this publicly? Is this um he's&nbsp; not he's not publicly known but people can contact&nbsp;&nbsp; MI6 and ask to speak to director Bonner you can&nbsp; contact MI6 on the website the phone number and&nbsp;&nbsp; MI6 will admit they do have a director Bonner&nbsp; there so what is the function of of telling&nbsp;&nbsp; us about this now is are they inviting people&nbsp; to to ask those questions or do they want that&nbsp;&nbsp; information out they want this information out&nbsp; they want this information out um Alfred Bonner&nbsp;&nbsp; he's from Bavaria. Um German effectively. He's um&nbsp; he you see him very interesting looking man. Um&nbsp;&nbsp; you your classic Aryan giant. The guy's 6'6. Um&nbsp; looks about 52 huge guy. Skinner box. A Skinner&nbsp;&nbsp; box is um famous psychiatrist Skinner. I forget&nbsp; his first name. Um he would he designed this box&nbsp;&nbsp; and he they put babies in it and they put animals&nbsp; in with the babies and they were doing cognitive&nbsp;&nbsp; behavior test. See, now the babies would react to&nbsp; the animals and um they would in this partic this&nbsp;&nbsp; this particular device um they put us in there and&nbsp; they set up screens in the corners of the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp; uh people's the people's faces would be put on&nbsp; the screens um enlarged and uh the faces would&nbsp;&nbsp; call us and get our attention. We'd look and the&nbsp; faces would start talking to us people and then&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the faces would look like they were um changing&nbsp; into uh half human, half whatever the animal&nbsp;&nbsp; was. So if it was a snake, if they were putting&nbsp; snakes in the pen, this the person talking would&nbsp;&nbsp; um start talking to us and then his face would&nbsp; change into half human, half snake lizard and&nbsp;&nbsp; um they George Bush senior was the main um handler&nbsp; of that particular Phil facility and um his face&nbsp;&nbsp; would often come on the screen and talk to us and&nbsp; he would do the very much the rep the reptile with&nbsp;&nbsp; the snakes. That would be his area. Was that&nbsp; something that was done on a recorded type&nbsp;&nbsp; of a level or was it he did it personally? He was&nbsp; on the screen. I'm not sure if he was that he was&nbsp;&nbsp; there sometimes physically but I mean the guy&nbsp; travels all around the world to all different&nbsp;&nbsp; bases. He's a major programmer so I don't know he&nbsp; could have been over the other side of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um and he would come on and um Did this something&nbsp; you experienced directly? This Yeah, I I saw him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He used to talk to us, talk to me. And um And what&nbsp; age were you when this happened? I was this was&nbsp;&nbsp; 76. I was a baby. Yeah. And this, you know, this&nbsp; carried on. I spent from 76 to 79 there and grew&nbsp;&nbsp; up there. Um the uh Queen Mother as well, she was&nbsp; a programmer there. She would um her face would&nbsp;&nbsp; be flashed on the screen, but her specialtity was&nbsp; wolves. Whenever they put the walls in with us,&nbsp;&nbsp; um she would come on and she'd talk to us and&nbsp; um she would start to change into halfwoman,&nbsp;&nbsp; half wolf like face on the screen. Was this done&nbsp; by some kind of electronic video effect or I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; know. I don't know. Um, can you name any other&nbsp; animals associated with different other people?&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, the only ones I remember is um George&nbsp; Brcina with snakes and the queen mother with&nbsp;&nbsp; um wolves. It's the place was very dark. I'm still&nbsp; starting to It's difficult to remember everything&nbsp;&nbsp; that happened there. Still coming back in bits and&nbsp; pieces. Um, I remember being put in the pen and&nbsp;&nbsp; um toy the group of babies and um there were toys&nbsp; put in and um one of the babies um took a toy off&nbsp;&nbsp; another baby and the um the little baby turned&nbsp; around and hissed at the other child like a snake&nbsp;&nbsp; and his face sort of went like a snake. So we this&nbsp; was absorbed into them psychologically or Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; into their psyche. Yeah. And with the DNA anyway&nbsp; that an anarchy DNA that the NSA were looking for. [Music] In part one, we heard how Michael&nbsp; Prince is the birth name for James Casbolt&nbsp;&nbsp; and how he was taken to a base in Canada near&nbsp; the small mountain town of Nelson in British&nbsp;&nbsp; Columbia for cyborg enhancement as mind control&nbsp; children selected by their specific blood types&nbsp;&nbsp; on how they were exposed to the open cold&nbsp; night in a large aircraft style hanger to&nbsp;&nbsp; sort out the men from the boys just as in ancient&nbsp; Sparta then guarded by Nazi SS troops. in modern&nbsp;&nbsp; type uniforms in the late 1970s. Michael sent this&nbsp; scan of one of his security clearances. However,&nbsp;&nbsp; in earlier images he sent claiming to be at&nbsp; the Dulce base, this could be anywhere. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; if anyone really knows what these forms refer&nbsp; to, please contact me at blue yonder.co.uk. What age were you when this happened? I was&nbsp; a this was 76. I was a baby. Yeah. And this,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, this carried on. I spent 76 to 79 there.&nbsp; and grew up there. Um the uh queen mother as well,&nbsp;&nbsp; she was a programmer there. She would um&nbsp; her face would be flashed on the screen,&nbsp;&nbsp; but her specialtity was wolves.&nbsp; Whenever they put the walls in with us,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, she would come on and she'd talk&nbsp; to us and, um, she would start to
