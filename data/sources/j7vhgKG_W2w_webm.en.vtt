00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:09.040
KN and we're continuing on with a series of&nbsp;
mind control in Canada. We've heard over the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.320
last 3 weeks a lecture by Dr. Colin Ross about&nbsp;
the history of the CIA and military mind control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.280
experimentation programs uh documented history.&nbsp;
Today we're going to start a an interview part&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.480
one of a two-part interview with Dr. Colin&nbsp;
Ross as we go into a bit more detail and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:36.960
uh explore the other many issues around this&nbsp;
situation. You're listening to CKLN 88.1.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.720
I'm speaking with Dr. Colin Ross, a psychiatrist&nbsp;
and researcher practicing in Dallas, Texas. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.080
uh uh Dr. Ross, I wonder if you could just&nbsp;
uh briefly describe who you are and what your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.400
current work is. Sure. I'm a Canadian by birth and&nbsp;
training. I went to medical school in Edmonton and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.120
did my psychiatry training in Winnipeg. I moved&nbsp;
down here to Dallas just a little over 5 years&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.800
ago. I'm a specialist in multiple personality&nbsp;
disorder and I've written a number of different&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.880
books and lots of research papers and so on on&nbsp;
that. Right now I'm working at a hospital in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.720
Dallas area here. We have a program that we run&nbsp;
on contract for the hospital which treats mostly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.960
people with multiple personality disorder. also&nbsp;
uh other related disorders. Most of the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.480
that we treat describe very traumatic and abusive&nbsp;
childhoods. Now um what is a dissociative identity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.960
disorder and is it the same thing as multiple&nbsp;
personality disorder? Dissociative identity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.840
disorder is the official new name for multiple&nbsp;
personality disorder hasn't really caught on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.440
in the general language. It's a professional&nbsp;
technical term. In 1994, that new diagnosis was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.480
introduced. It just replaces multiple personality&nbsp;
disorder and the criteria for diagnosing it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.160
have been changed a little bit basically by&nbsp;
adding a requirement for some type of amnesia,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.320
but basically it means the same thing as multiple&nbsp;
personality. So, what does it mean when somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.640
has this disorder? What Well, the basic criteria&nbsp;
for diagnosing are pretty straightforward.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.680
You have these different personality states or&nbsp;
identities that take turns being in control of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.840
body and there's some sort of amnesia or memory&nbsp;
barrier between the different personality states.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.960
The several important points to understand about&nbsp;
this disorder are first of all it's not literally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.440
true that they have different personalities.&nbsp;
They just have these fragmented components of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.320
one personality and those have been referred to&nbsp;
as different personalities for over 100 years but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.480
they're not literally different personalities.&nbsp;
There isn't really more than one person there.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.920
And there's several different ways you can end&nbsp;
up having multiple personality. One way, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.040
what we think we see most of the time clinically,&nbsp;
is where you've basically been physically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.920
sexually, emotionally abused or neglected as a&nbsp;
child, and you create these different identities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.000
to cope with it and hold different memories and&nbsp;
feelings about it and so on. And that can be,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.480
as I said, a combination of various types&nbsp;
of trauma in childhood. It has to be fairly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.560
serious trauma usually. Then another way that&nbsp;
you can get multiple personality is um where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.360
it's created either by mistake or deliberately by&nbsp;
somebody else. And that could be in a bad therapy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.800
which is all out of control and not being handled&nbsp;
properly. And then the other major way of arriving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.360
at multiple personality disorder is people&nbsp;
who have what's called a factitious disorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.240
That means that they deliberately fake having&nbsp;
it either to get into the patient role or get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:39.040
attention or get out of something or for some&nbsp;
specific purpose. Now, have you seen this disorder&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.040
occur um due to trauma as an adult or does it&nbsp;
specifically happen while while a child? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.400
there's some cases reported in the literature and&nbsp;
there's the odd case where it's trauma that starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.080
in adulthood, but vast majority of time it seems&nbsp;
to be childhood. Right. We've uh listened to your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.880
lecture um talking about the history of uh US mind&nbsp;
control. You refer to the term yatrogenic. What&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.640
does that mean? Yatrogenic is just a Greek word&nbsp;
that means created by the doctor. So yatrogenic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.400
multiple personality is multiple personality&nbsp;
that's created by mistake by a bad therapist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.480
who's using improper techniques. Okay. How did you&nbsp;
get involved in working with people suffering from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.320
DID? Well, I actually diagnosed my first case&nbsp;
when I was a medical student in Edmonton and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.640
uh just instantly found it really fascinating&nbsp;
and interesting. And then when I was doing my&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.480
four years of psychiatry training in Winnipeg,&nbsp;
I saw one more case and I thought it was going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:44.000
to be too rare to really specialize in. But then&nbsp;
in ' 85 when I finished my psychiatry training,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.400
I diagnosed another case and then I got some&nbsp;
referrals and then more referrals and then I&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.680
got a reputation for it and ended up getting lots&nbsp;
of referrals from all kinds of different people in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:01.040
Western Canada and gradually sort of switched over&nbsp;
to that being my specialty. And this this was when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.680
you were operating a practice in is it Winnipeg or&nbsp;
Edmonton at the time? Yeah, Winnipeg. Right. I was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.600
a full-time uh university professor of psychiatry&nbsp;
at one of the hospitals there. And and what did&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:19.120
you find from what were your findings from working&nbsp;
with people with DID or MPD? Well, I've published&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.240
just on multiple personality and related things.&nbsp;
I've published probably about 60 or so papers in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.840
the professional literature. So, I've found quite&nbsp;
a few different things, but the main theme is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.160
really goes through the whole multiple personality&nbsp;
literature. And that is that people who have this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.920
diagnosis clinically uh have lots of other things&nbsp;
going on at the same time. lots of depression,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.600
lots of anxiety, drug and alcohol problems,&nbsp;
eating disorder problems, sleep problems. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.160
they don't just have multiple personality,&nbsp;
they got all kinds of different symptoms. They&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.400
also tend to be in the health care system for&nbsp;
quite a long period of time. Not all the time,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.040
but the majority of cases are in the health care&nbsp;
system getting psychiatric treatment for one thing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:05.200
or another for quite a while. On average about&nbsp;
uh 7 years before the multiple personality is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.600
diagnosed. And the other theme that we see going&nbsp;
all the time is this childhood trauma that arises&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.760
as a way of coping with childhood trauma. And then&nbsp;
we just uh actually just found out this week that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.120
a paper has been accepted at the American&nbsp;
Journal of Psychiatry where we assessed 103&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.720
people with this diagnosis here in Dallas about&nbsp;
uh almost exactly four years ago now. We gave&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.840
them a whole bunch of different questionnaires&nbsp;
and standardized tests and interviews and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.880
And then we followed up as many as we could two&nbsp;
years later. And we were able to follow up 54 of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.440
them. And the uh reduction in all these different&nbsp;
symptoms was really impressive. And 12 already in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.120
the first two years of follow-up, 12 of the 54&nbsp;
people were all integrated back into one person.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:59.040
So they had a really dramatic and meaningful&nbsp;
reduction in not just the amount of multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.960
personality related symptoms, but depression,&nbsp;
anxiety, substance abuse, all kinds of things.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:11.600
So this is the first uh scientifically designed&nbsp;
kind of treatment outcome study that really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.480
shows that good treatment can be very helpful. So&nbsp;
these people that you're talking about did undergo&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:21.600
treatment with you or other other therapists came&nbsp;
they came to our hospital usually for an average&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:27.760
of about 17 days or so. Mhm. Uh 70% of our people&nbsp;
are from outside Texas. So they're from all over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:35.360
the United States and we've had probably about&nbsp;
15 admissions of people from Ontario and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.080
were then go home and are followed up by their&nbsp;
therapists. So they only get about usually two,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.200
three, sometimes four weeks with us and they may&nbsp;
go into our day hospital program for a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.920
as well, but basically they're followed up by&nbsp;
therapists all over the country. And are these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.280
therapists in contact with you in terms of um&nbsp;
methods of therapy? Yeah, they've usually read&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.640
my books and been to some of my workshops and&nbsp;
are aware of my approach, but they don't have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.240
to necessarily follow my approach. Right. And&nbsp;
these other symptoms that you were talking about,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:11.440
do you feel that they were also a result of&nbsp;
childhood trauma? Yeah, the whole package seems&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:19.520
to be related to childhood trauma. Uh now we got a&nbsp;
lot of controversy about this going on in society&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:26.320
in the psych psychology, psychiatry, sociology&nbsp;
and so on, right? And we need a lot more research,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.200
but that's the best understanding I have right&nbsp;
now. And there's fair bit of research data that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.520
backs that up. It's not totally nailed down&nbsp;
scientifically. Mhm. Um, I'm wondering from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:42.880
your experience working in in Canada, how has the&nbsp;
Canadian medical system responded to your your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:49.920
findings in in MPD research? Well, roughly about&nbsp;
the same as American. Overall, there's a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:56.800
skepticism, a lot of political agitation, fair bit&nbsp;
of negative hostile propaganda and backstabbing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:03.200
about it. And u, and then there's also quite a&nbsp;
lot of support. And obviously if I've gotten 50&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:09.440
or 60 professional papers published, I'm getting a&nbsp;
reasonable reception. The main difference between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:14.560
Canada and the United States was in Canada, I just&nbsp;
couldn't get the financial or clinical support to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:19.920
set up and run a program. And the reason that's&nbsp;
possible down here is because there's a private&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:25.040
for-profit sector in the mental health system&nbsp;
that's profit driven. That's a business. and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:30.560
the the hospital corporation I contract with&nbsp;
is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.480
on. And since I attract patients, then there's a&nbsp;
financial motive for the hospital to be interested&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:44.400
in me providing that service. So that financial&nbsp;
motive allows the system to sort of set aside all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:50.080
of these ideological and political debates that&nbsp;
go on and so therefore I'm able to run a program.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.440
So for the uh survivors of childhood abuse that&nbsp;
you're dealing with, I I guess they would have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:01.440
have access to some kind of um funds to be able&nbsp;
to undergo therapy. What what what is your sense&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:08.880
of of uh people um that have undergone this in&nbsp;
childhood that do not have access to to therapy?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:16.080
Well, the uh breakdown in terms of insurance&nbsp;
coverage that we have in our program is roughly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.320
about 50% are on Medicare, which is a government&nbsp;
disability program. So, they're sort of like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.480
Canadian healthcare system people in that their&nbsp;
health insurance is basically paid for by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:32.320
government. And they also get disability welfare&nbsp;
type payments for their basic support and living.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:38.400
So, half of our people are really insured in a way&nbsp;
fairly similar to Canada. Then the other half have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.920
some sort of private insurance through their&nbsp;
employers or their spouse's employers. The if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.920
you're in the one-third of people in the United&nbsp;
States who don't have proper medical insurance,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:56.000
then you can't get proper medical care, including&nbsp;
psychiatric and including the kind we provide. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.080
that would seem to be uh probably a reason to&nbsp;
think that the Canadian health care system is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:09.200
superior to the US. The funny thing is that if you&nbsp;
have multiple personality or a related disorder,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.720
your odds of getting treatment are actually&nbsp;
better in the United States because there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:17.920
more programs and more therapists available. In&nbsp;
Canada, even though you have universal access&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:23.120
and universal coverage and actual practical&nbsp;
reality, you can't get the treatment. So, you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.560
got theoretical universal coverage for multiple&nbsp;
personality and trauma related disorders, but you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:34.880
don't have real practical coverage in reality.&nbsp;
Well, the sort of paradox is that in the United&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:41.280
States actually a higher percentage of people who&nbsp;
could benefit from psychotherapy for all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:48.000
problems arising from their childhoods um who&nbsp;
can actually get therapy is higher in the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:56.560
Interesting. Um now in your previous lecture you&nbsp;
did uh go into a lot of um uh detail outlining the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:04.080
history of mind control. What is the link between&nbsp;
MPD and mind control experimentation? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.920
how I got into this is a sort of a backdoor&nbsp;
route. I I didn't really have any interest in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.480
the CIA or the military or mind control research&nbsp;
or all of that. Particularly when I left Canada,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.680
hadn't read about it. Hadn't really heard&nbsp;
any other doctors talking about it. Hadn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:26.080
heard any patients talking about it. And pretty&nbsp;
soon after I arrived in Texas in early 1992,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:31.600
multiple personality patients started talking&nbsp;
about kind of real strange experiences I didn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.840
know what to make of that involved either going&nbsp;
into hospitals, some sort of research setting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:44.000
somewhere on a military base and having different&nbsp;
kinds of experiments done on them which involved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:52.880
um EEG machines or some kind of scientific&nbsp;
equipment and sensory deprivation,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:52.880 --> 00:13:00.000
maybe physical spinning, maybe hallucinogens,&nbsp;
and it wasn't any kind of uh cult and obviously&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.920
wasn't just their parents or something going&nbsp;
on in their family. And initially I thought&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:12.880
that was really too much to believe. But then I&nbsp;
decided I should at least look into it a little&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:18.560
bit. So I started basically in early '92 doing a&nbsp;
little bit of reading. And the more reading I did,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:24.000
what amazed me was that instead of coming to the&nbsp;
conclusion, oh well, this is not possible. There's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.200
no documentation of this kind of stuff. Actually,&nbsp;
the more I read, the more documentation I got that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.480
all kinds of absolutely unbelievable and bizarre&nbsp;
and unethical and harmful mind control research&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:40.320
has been done in Canada and the United States&nbsp;
since the Second World War. And I've actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:46.880
um interviewed and spoken with a number of people&nbsp;
who have documented mind control research. Most of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:50.880
the patients that we work with who we hear these&nbsp;
kind of things from, we get zero documentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:57.680
that it's actually real. So I kind of disconnected&nbsp;
my my research or my study about this from the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:03.040
stories I was hearing from the patients and did it&nbsp;
as a separate research project. And what I've done&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:07.840
then over the last 5 years is uh talked to lots&nbsp;
of other people in the field who are interested in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.800
this. Read pretty well everything that's written&nbsp;
on it. And through the Freedom of Information Act,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:18.960
I've got somewhere in probably in the ballpark&nbsp;
of six or 7,000 pages of documents from the CIA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:24.800
which I've reviewed. And then I've gone to the uh&nbsp;
medical school library and I've sent my secretary&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:31.280
to five or six different places in the United&nbsp;
States to go into archives in special collections&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:38.640
and library resources and so on. So I've ended&nbsp;
up now with probably more than almost two full&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:46.160
four drawer filing cabinets full of documentation&nbsp;
on all kinds of things. how I got into this and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.640
the connection with multiple personality for me&nbsp;
personally was just that my multiple personality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:55.760
patients were the ones who started telling these&nbsp;
kind of stories and got me interested in it. Right&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:00.560
now from from a therapist point of view, how&nbsp;
how do you tell if somebody is giving you an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:06.560
account of actual abuse or whether they're just&nbsp;
fabricating something? Well, basically all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.880
professional associations including the Canadian&nbsp;
Psychiatric Association that have made statements&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:16.880
on this and all the scientific research completely&nbsp;
supports the conclusion that you can't tell. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.920
that goes both ways. You cannot tell. You can't&nbsp;
tell for sure just by listening to the patient's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.200
story. You can't tell that it's true. Also, you&nbsp;
can't tell for sure that it's false. In other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.000
words, you can't tell one way or the other without&nbsp;
some sort of outside proof. that is proof that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.280
it really happened or proof that it really didn't&nbsp;
happen. And what I've learned in the especially in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:45.440
the last five years is there's really no limit to&nbsp;
how detailed, how compelling, how full of feeling,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:51.600
how detailed a bunch of memories can be and&nbsp;
be either totally real or never have happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.560
M I've worked with people who had really really&nbsp;
really elaborate memories of all kinds of things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:02.800
with tremendous amount of detail and then we've&nbsp;
been able to prove it never happened. Right. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.240
that uh can't tell and that's why I decided to&nbsp;
do this research kind of separated off from what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:14.320
the patients were telling me. right now. What&nbsp;
um what uh similarities have you come across&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:20.080
in within the survivor accounts and what you've&nbsp;
discovered in the CIA documentation about their&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:25.280
mind control programs? Well, basically, if you&nbsp;
take a a typical elaborate story that you'll hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:30.400
from one of multiple personality patients who have&nbsp;
these kind of memories and you break it down into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.760
the elements or components of the mind control&nbsp;
techniques that they describe, I've been able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:42.400
document just about every one with maybe one or&nbsp;
two exceptions. And all of this was carried out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:49.440
in a series of programs that um really began in&nbsp;
the Second World War with what was called the OSS,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:54.720
the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor&nbsp;
to the CIA. Yeah. It was set up immediately after&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:59.120
Pearl Harbor when it became obvious that there&nbsp;
was a huge problem with US military intelligence&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:04.000
gathering because they were totally surprised&nbsp;
by the Japanese. And so it was set up in about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.280
1941. And then at the end of the war, the OSS was&nbsp;
disbanded. And then two years later, the personnel&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:17.680
were rolled over into the CIA, which was created&nbsp;
in September 1947 through the National Security&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:24.720
Act. Basically the same people who had been in&nbsp;
the OSS. And the OSS did various kinds of drug&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:31.120
research and mind control research uh including&nbsp;
with hallucinogens and so on and marijuana and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:37.600
sodiuml and so on and different types of drugs.&nbsp;
Also they did experiments with hypnosis. There's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:45.520
um then a little bit of a gap before the CIA&nbsp;
started up a series of programs in 1951. There was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:51.920
two programs called Artichoke and Bluebird that&nbsp;
ran until about 1953 and they were rolled over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:51.920 --> 00:18:00.720
into MK Ultra which ran from 1953 to 1964. Then MK&nbsp;
Ultra was rolled over into MK search which ran up&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:08.720
till 1973 and then running concurrently with MK&nbsp;
Ultra and MK search. There's about roughly about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:14.640
10 other programs that are declassified. There's a&nbsp;
little smattering of information on each of those.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:22.400
They have names like MK Naomi and QK Hilltop&nbsp;
and MK Delta. The the by far the best known and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:30.000
the one that I have the most documents on is MK&nbsp;
Ultra. Mhm. It involved 149 different uh separate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.360
contracts at about 80 different institutions all&nbsp;
around Canada and the United States. And in MK&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:44.800
Naomi, MK Ultra and MK search, there's basically&nbsp;
about three major blocks of types of mind control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:52.720
research. about uh half the projects in MK Ultra&nbsp;
for instance were on some sort of procurement of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:52.720 --> 00:19:00.080
chemicals, supplying chemicals or manufacturing&nbsp;
chemicals which is mostly hallucinogens sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:07.600
uh biological warfare weapons such as bacteria and&nbsp;
viruses and sometimes other types of chemicals for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:13.200
mind control research. So it was just straight&nbsp;
contracting to get the chemicals. An example of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:21.120
that would be in 1953, one of the MK Ultra sub&nbsp;
projects, was a $400,000 grant to Eli Liy, which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:28.000
is the drug company that manufactures Prozac. Mhm.&nbsp;
And that was for manufacturing LSD. So the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.960
first major supplier of LSD in North America was&nbsp;
actually Eli Lilly Drug Company. And and there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:40.560
evidence that the CIA had uh was responsible for&nbsp;
the distribution of this throughout the United&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:46.960
States and North America. Yeah, they used it in&nbsp;
actual experiments. Uh, and they also turned some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:53.840
of it over to the military through their MK Naomi&nbsp;
program. A lot of the army mind control and drug&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.920
research was done at Edgeware Arsenal, which&nbsp;
has been in the news a lot recently because of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:05.040
a lot of sexual assault and rape of female&nbsp;
um, army personnel there. And it's in uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.680
it's linked to Fort Detric and Aberdine Proving&nbsp;
Ground in Maryland, sort of north a little bit&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:17.120
north of Washington DC. Is this the same military&nbsp;
base that uh the BBC documentary was done about uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:24.640
them giving um very powerful drugs to US soldiers?&nbsp;
Yeah. Yeah. That it's was the major center for all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:30.480
kinds of hallucinogen and other drug research.&nbsp;
Um the main one would that's best known as LSD,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:36.240
but actually the army released a list of about 130&nbsp;
different compounds that it tested in mind control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:44.080
research that was released in 1975. So there's at&nbsp;
least 130 different uh drugs and different types&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:52.160
of compounds that they admit using on experimental&nbsp;
subjects and they admit to um again in the mid70s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:59.200
they admitted to testing LSD on at least 1500&nbsp;
subjects. So if you just do the arithmetic very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:06.720
roughly, if if they gave LSD to 1500 people and&nbsp;
they tested 130 different drugs, that was just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:12.880
the army and you figure there's four branches of&nbsp;
the military in the United States plus the CIA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.040
you're talking about a huge number of people,&nbsp;
potentially hundreds of thousands of people who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.560
got at least one dose of some experimental&nbsp;
mind control drug, usually without any kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.680
of adequate informed consent at all. Now, who&nbsp;
typically would these people be? Where where are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:33.120
they drawing their their subjects from? Actually,&nbsp;
I'd just like to pop back to um talking about Eli&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.800
Liy for a second, just finish off that part of&nbsp;
the story, and then I'll answer that question.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:43.440
Okay. Uh LSD was discovered accidentally in&nbsp;
1943 by a man named Albert Hoffman working at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:50.480
Sand Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland. Mhm. Which&nbsp;
is a drug company. And uh what happened was that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.760
in the late 40s early 50s a rumor developed that&nbsp;
the Russians might try to buy up the entire world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:55.760 --> 00:22:04.240
supply of LSD. So that's why the CIA decided to&nbsp;
contract with um the uh drug company in the United&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:09.760
States that manufactures Prozac, which is Eli Liy,&nbsp;
so they could have a secure North American supply.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:15.200
And one of the things that amazed me absolutely&nbsp;
the most doing this background research was to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:21.200
find out who the original acid heads were in North&nbsp;
America. Cuz you would assume it'd be beatnicks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.880
or criminals or musicians or somebody or other.&nbsp;
Turns out that the original acid heads in North&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.200
America were actually the psychiatrists&nbsp;
and the CIA and military personnel. in in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:41.120
uh conferences that were financially sponsored by&nbsp;
the CIA that resulted in books. I've got dozens of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:46.160
these psychiatrists who are some of the major drug&nbsp;
researchers and major psychiatrists in the second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:51.840
half of the 20th century all describing the acid&nbsp;
trips they were on, how much they enjoyed them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:57.360
how useful they thought they were, and describing&nbsp;
using LSD to treat all kinds of different things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:04.400
from alcoholism to anxiety to even homosexuality,&nbsp;
which they considered to be a disease. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.360
they were themselves turning themselves and each&nbsp;
other on. And then they were using all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:16.000
different subjects. The majority would be either&nbsp;
psychiatric patients who are already in treatment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.960
um army personnel, prisoners in several different&nbsp;
prisons in the United States or in one project&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:29.360
which was through MK Ultra. They actually had uh&nbsp;
prostitutes that they hired through MK Ultra and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.720
they uh set up safe houses in San Francisco, New&nbsp;
York. The prostitutes would go out on the street&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:40.880
and recruit people for tricks. uh the CIA people&nbsp;
would watch the tricks through one-way mirrors and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:47.360
monitor the sex and the prostitutes would slip&nbsp;
the John's LSD and other hallucinogens and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:51.680
these people were totally unaware that they were&nbsp;
involved in any kind of government experiment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.960
totally unaware that they were going to get LSD&nbsp;
at all. Gave no consent whatsoever. So most of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:03.760
time the subjects were somebody who was one one&nbsp;
notch down in the power setup. They were either an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:11.040
employee of the institution where the doctor was&nbsp;
doing the research, they were a patient, they were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:17.200
um somebody in the military who loosely speaking&nbsp;
volunteered but really didn't have much choice&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:23.040
or they were prisoners. So usually was somebody&nbsp;
who was under the control of the administration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:29.120
and under the control of the doctors somehow&nbsp;
to some extent. Now, what uh specifically what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.320
prisons were involved in the uh the mind control&nbsp;
experiments? Uh one of the prisons that was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:40.240
New Jersey Reformatory at Bordontown, which is&nbsp;
in Pennsylvania. The investigator there was Carl&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:48.480
Feifer, who had a lot of uh MK Ultra and MK search&nbsp;
money. He was also um besides being at the New&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.520
Jersey neurosychiatric research institute which&nbsp;
is where he did the work at Bordontown. He was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:58.320
chairman of the department of pharmarmacology&nbsp;
at one of the major universities in Atlanta,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:04.320
Emory University. And while he was there he&nbsp;
did LSD experiments on people in the Atlanta&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:14.720
uh penitentiary. Uh there was the um narcotics&nbsp;
farm in Lexington, Kentucky, which was a prison&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:20.400
that was uh mainly for drugrelated offenders.&nbsp;
And then uh one of the more sinister ones is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:26.640
Vakavville State Prison in California. Mhm.&nbsp;
Vakavville State Prison was an MK search site&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:33.680
where they did um drug research related to the&nbsp;
drug pemoline which is called Silert. The trade&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:38.800
name is Silert. It's used for attention deficit&nbsp;
disorder in kids. They were using it to study&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:46.160
memory enhancement through drugs. And that was at&nbsp;
the same time as Donald Dreeze was an inmate at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:54.080
Vakavville. Donald Defze was the head of the SLA&nbsp;
liberation army that captured Patty Hurst. Uh at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:59.280
the same time that there was drug research going&nbsp;
on at the New Jersey Reformatory at Bordontown,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:05.280
a man was then imprisoned there whose name was&nbsp;
Louis Castillo and he was uh later arrested in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:12.400
the Philippines on suspicion of being there to&nbsp;
assassinate Marcos for Nan Marcos and he exhibited&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:21.360
uh five distinct personalities on um 40 different&nbsp;
interviews conducted by the Philippines FBI.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:28.320
There was consultation from the Philippines FBI to&nbsp;
the American FBI his case also because he alleged&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:34.160
that he was involved in the Kennedy assassination.&nbsp;
There was a consultation with uh Gerald Ford who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:40.720
was on the Warren Commission. So all of this&nbsp;
is sort of tied into all kinds of aspects of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:47.920
the whole second half of the 20th century.&nbsp;
This very very twisted convoluted history.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:55.520
Mhm. people who um were the expert witnesses&nbsp;
for Patty Hurst uh who were saying that she&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:55.520 --> 00:27:00.800
had been captured by the Simines Liberation Army&nbsp;
and brainwashed by them using the mind control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.280
techniques of destructive cults which are very&nbsp;
similar to the mind control techniques of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:13.600
CIA military mind control. The those witnesses&nbsp;
included uh Robert Lifton, Margaret Singer,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:20.720
Martin, and a psychiatrist named Jolly West. and&nbsp;
Jolly West and Martin Orin were had top secret&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:27.120
clearance and had MK Ultra money. Their testimony&nbsp;
about Patty Hurst was that a new identity named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:32.720
Tanya had been created through these brainwashing&nbsp;
techniques and Patty Hurst identified herself as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:38.160
Tanya when she robbed a bank. She was convicted&nbsp;
and found guilty and actually sentenced to jail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:45.200
for that. So the uh experts in a lot of the CIA&nbsp;
mind control programming were very aware of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.920
possibility of creating an artificial multiple&nbsp;
personality through mind control techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:56.400
And they testified that this had been done by this&nbsp;
character Donald Defreeze who was a black criminal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:56.400 --> 00:28:04.080
who was basically a petty criminal and thief. The&nbsp;
there's several strange twists of that story. Uh,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:10.160
one of the strange twists which is somewhat&nbsp;
documented but not completely documented is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:15.920
that Donald Def's according to several different&nbsp;
sources and according to Patty Hurst uh biography&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:23.360
as well was actually an employee of the CIA during&nbsp;
the Vietnam War who's a psychological warfare oh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:30.000
sorry there's a not Donald Dere himself another&nbsp;
man named Coloulston Westbrook was an employee of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.960
uh the CIA full-time and was a psychological&nbsp;
warfare expert in Vietnam camp and according&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:41.200
to these several different books, he came back&nbsp;
uh and got a job at the University of Berkeley&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:47.040
as a language instructor. And then he entered&nbsp;
Vakavville prison under cover of the Black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:53.520
Cultural Association, which was a black prisoners&nbsp;
and inmates program. And undercover of that black&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.560
cultural association, he used mind control&nbsp;
techniques on Donald Defreeze and actually&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:05.920
gave him his code name of Sank and designed the&nbsp;
seven-headed Cobra logo of the Symbian Liberation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:11.120
Army. Then Donald Dreeze was transferred&nbsp;
from a maximum security facility at VAC,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:16.560
namely Vakavville to a low security facility from&nbsp;
which he immediately escaped and several months&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:23.440
after then captured Patty Hurst and used fairly&nbsp;
sophisticated mind control techniques on her and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:30.320
created this Manurion candidate second identity&nbsp;
bank robber and her named Tanya. So unless all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:38.080
this is highly coincidental, um what you're saying&nbsp;
is that the SLA was a CIA creation. That's I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:44.160
know for a documented fact that that's true, but&nbsp;
um that's what these several different books are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:50.160
alleging and the information is fairly detailed&nbsp;
and I'm trying to research up on that. But it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:57.760
absolutely known for a fact that um these do&nbsp;
two doctors, Dr. West and Dr. Or had extensive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:05.360
uh funding from all branches of military and and&nbsp;
he published off starting in 1943 and going all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:10.960
the way up to 1971 very very detailed accounts&nbsp;
of creating multiple personality during the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:17.760
Second World War for uh various branches of the&nbsp;
US military. And basically these people were he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:23.360
called them multiple personality. uh he talked&nbsp;
about the multiple personality literature and he&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:29.680
referred to them as super spies. So the the idea&nbsp;
is that you create somebody artificially using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:35.120
hypnosis and other mind control techniques who&nbsp;
had no multiple personality before but now has&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:40.640
this second identity and the second identity&nbsp;
is hidden behind a memory barrier or amnesia&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:48.320
barrier and there's a verbal access code that's&nbsp;
used to call out the second identity. And so now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:54.000
say the person is a marine, they'll be given&nbsp;
some kind of a courier assignment to take some&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:01.280
documents say to Tokyo, but GHS then calls out the&nbsp;
second personality and sticks in some classified&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:08.240
information into the second personality. The then&nbsp;
there's a switch back to the main identity. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:13.360
person is just going on this routine trip to take&nbsp;
some sort of documents or technical materials over&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:21.200
to Tokyo. when it gets to the far end then uh he&nbsp;
uses the example of a Colonel Brown. Colonel Brown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:27.440
in Tokyo then uses the code signal and the example&nbsp;
that he gives and one of the description is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:33.200
this Colonel Brown says the moon is clear. As&nbsp;
soon as he says the moon is clear then the other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:41.040
identity pops out gives the classified message.&nbsp;
Colonel Brown inserts a classified response. Then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:46.240
the person pops back to their regular identity,&nbsp;
goes back home and thinks that they've just been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:52.560
on a routine assignment. But Esther Brooks again&nbsp;
says the moon is clear. The identity comes out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.840
and Esther Brooks gets the classified message&nbsp;
from this Colonel Brown. So he describes using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:06.880
these people in hypnotic uh courier u missions&nbsp;
and for actual operations extensively many times&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:11.680
during the second world war. So this is in George&nbsp;
Eterbrook's own documentation that he's describing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:19.040
this right and he also describes using them for in&nbsp;
infiltration operations. So the idea there is you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:26.320
take somebody who's a loyal patriotic marine and&nbsp;
you create in them a new identity of a communist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:33.360
and you submerge the previous identity of the&nbsp;
patriotic marine. Now this person who's a a really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.160
diehard communist goes and infiltrates various&nbsp;
communist cells or political organizations or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:44.720
does whatever spy work is required. And the idea&nbsp;
is if one of these couriers or these infiltration&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:52.240
agents is captured and interrogated, they actually&nbsp;
have no idea that they're spies. They genuinely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:57.200
think they're either on just a routine mission or&nbsp;
they generally believe that they're communists. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:03.280
then they can't be interrogated and they can't&nbsp;
be uh made to reveal information so easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:09.040
And then what of course they go in and they&nbsp;
do whatever infiltration operation is required&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.360
and then they come back and they're debriefed by&nbsp;
Esther Brooks who knows how to get through to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:18.080
original personality and some of these people are&nbsp;
actually g according to Esther Brooks were given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:25.040
dishonorable discharges as part of their cover.&nbsp;
Now one question about that is is Etorbrooks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:31.920
just telling tall tales? Well, I've been able to&nbsp;
build up a lot of documentation about him and his&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:38.240
uh personal archives are still housed at this&nbsp;
Colgate College. I photocopied probably what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:44.960
would be a pile of paper at least a foot deep. And&nbsp;
what did that those documents reveal to you? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:50.960
it's all his personal papers, correspondence,&nbsp;
background, and so I've got uh actual original&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:55.360
documents photocopied now showing that he in&nbsp;
fact was employed by the War Department during&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:04.000
the Second World War. um he uh marketed his ideas&nbsp;
to every branch of military intelligence in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:10.640
United States. There's tons of correspondents&nbsp;
with him from all kinds of navy, army, air force&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:20.800
intelligence people. Uh he did a lot of training&nbsp;
at Fort Hullird and other locations. Um, and one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:26.560
of the most interesting things about him is that&nbsp;
he corresponded pretty regularly with Jay Edgar&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:32.160
Hoover from the 1930s through into the 1960s. He&nbsp;
had a lot of correspondence with Jed Garoover.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:39.200
There was a lot of FBI personnel who came out and&nbsp;
visited him, attended his different teachings and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:46.080
uh a lot of these people talked about reading&nbsp;
his textbook which came out in 1943 that's called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:51.200
hypnotism and in that textbook he describes&nbsp;
these um artificial multiple personalities in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:59.680
a lot of detail. I've got good documentation of&nbsp;
the CIA in Bluebird and Artichoke did pretty much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:05.520
the same experiments. They describe several&nbsp;
different things. They they don't describe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:09.920
actual operations, but they describe real life&nbsp;
simulations where they're testing these people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:16.080
So, they describe the same thing that Sbrooks is&nbsp;
talking about where they uh hypnotize somebody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:21.600
and condition them and create a second identity&nbsp;
that can stand up on to a lie detector test.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:27.760
Also, they describe creating amnesia barriers&nbsp;
and having people go on assignments where they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.080
go into another building and rifle through&nbsp;
some materials and take some documents and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:38.880
bring them back and then have no memory of doing&nbsp;
that whatsoever. And uh in MK Ultra there was a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:44.800
contractor named Alden Sears who did experiments&nbsp;
at the University of Minnesota and the University&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:51.120
of Denver which were very similar and there's&nbsp;
a lot of documentation of him uh procuring CIA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:56.400
safe houses for some of his experiments coming and&nbsp;
doing demonstrations of these kind of techniques&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:04.320
for military and CIA personnel and uh creating&nbsp;
hypnotic couriers and so on. So there's several&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:11.120
sets of documents that back up that this was done&nbsp;
at an experimental level by the CIA successfully,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:16.880
but I don't have documents about their use in&nbsp;
operations. Now you mentioned that there were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:21.520
three areas of of interest in the mind control&nbsp;
experimentation. Um wonder if we could just review&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:27.760
those again. You you mentioned drugs. A big chunk&nbsp;
was just uh manufacturing and supplying drugs,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:34.640
chemicals, and biological weapons. Another uh&nbsp;
large chunk was actually using the drugs in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:40.800
experiments on people to try and create amnesia&nbsp;
to create altered states of consciousness to test&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:46.800
the drugs for interrogation purposes and also to&nbsp;
test them for detecting hypnotically programmed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:52.800
agents. There was a team called the Artichoke team&nbsp;
that was created as part of Project Artichoke that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:58.160
would use different chemical and mind control&nbsp;
sensor deprivation techniques to try and figure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.600
out if somebody had been hypnotically programmed&nbsp;
by another intelligence agency. In other words,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.560
they were trying to pick up these hypnotically&nbsp;
controlled double agents that had been created&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:16.160
either by the KGB or whoever. Then about a quarter&nbsp;
of the research projects were just kind of odds&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:22.000
and ends of all different types, different&nbsp;
psychology and sociology experiments. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.400
a man named R. Gordon Wson who wrote a book&nbsp;
called Soma, the divine mushroom of immortality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.520
which is about that uh toad stool that you always&nbsp;
see in fairy tales, which has got a white stock&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:40.000
and a red cap with white flexcks on it. That's&nbsp;
a mushroom ammonita mascara. It's a hallucinagen&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.920
that was used by circumpolar shamans in both&nbsp;
uh northern Canada, Alaska, and Siberia for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:54.480
centuries. So this R. Gordon Wson, who called this&nbsp;
mushroom soma, divine mushroom of immortality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:54.480 --> 00:38:01.600
he had an MK Ultra grant through JP Morgan company&nbsp;
to go on an expedition to northern Mexico to try&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:07.440
and find hallucenic mushrooms. And just to give&nbsp;
you an example of how all these things kind of tie&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:16.720
into our culture at large, J. Chester Brooks gave&nbsp;
uh three or four major symposia that he set up at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:24.400
Colgate College and he invited all kinds of people&nbsp;
to them which included Martin Or um in one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:29.680
actually two of the different uh conferences&nbsp;
or symposia that he put on Aldis Huxley came&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:37.280
and talked and Aldis Huxley used hallucinogens&nbsp;
himself and wrote the novel the brave new world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.560
in the brave new world which is a science fiction&nbsp;
book, the government controls the people by giving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:49.520
them a mind control drug called soma. So all these&nbsp;
things are kind of very strangely interconnected&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:54.960
with each other. Not as part of a huge conspiracy,&nbsp;
but just because all these people knew each other,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:02.800
talked to each other, influenced and affected each&nbsp;
other. One of the um purposes of a lot of the sub&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:08.880
projects, four of the MK Ultra sub projects were&nbsp;
on children and three of those investigators knew&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:14.880
that it was did not know it was CIA money and&nbsp;
one did know it was CIA money. But the research&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:20.960
projects themselves were pretty bland and not very&nbsp;
alarming. So the purpose there as stated by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:28.880
CIA is not really the research as such. One of&nbsp;
them MKlra sub project 103 was at the children's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:34.960
international summer camp in Maine and it was a&nbsp;
camp basically where children from all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:40.560
different countries would come and spend uh weeks&nbsp;
or a summer and the purpose of the research was to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:46.320
study how children communicate and solve problems&nbsp;
when they don't share a common language but the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:52.480
purpose of the CIA funding which was secret was&nbsp;
that they wanted to establish contact with a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:57.920
whole bunch of foreign international children who&nbsp;
were as young as 11 years old because they might&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.000
be of potential intelligence use in the future. In&nbsp;
other words, they were just interested in getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.760
an inn so they could make a list of people&nbsp;
and start figuring out who might be an good&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:14.640
person to recruit for whatever CIA purpose in the&nbsp;
future. And they were doing this with really just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:22.400
children. Now you also you mentioned that um uh&nbsp;
multiple personalities are much easily much more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:30.720
easily created um within children and if the&nbsp;
um uh if the military and CIA's um goals were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:37.760
to use multiple personalities for intelligence&nbsp;
purposes um is there evidence of experimentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:42.880
on children? uh not experimentation to&nbsp;
create multiple personality directly,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:49.360
but there's experiments on children that were&nbsp;
you would think were totally un unbelievable,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:53.520
impossible, could never happen. And if if you&nbsp;
heard somebody telling you about them, you just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:59.280
think the person was making it up or was diluted,&nbsp;
but actually I have the publications that describe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:06.800
the research. One thing is that GH Esster Brooks&nbsp;
himself did some kind of hypnosis experiments on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:12.480
children at two different orphanages in northern&nbsp;
New York. So he did create multiple personality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:17.520
experimentally. He did correspond with Jed&nbsp;
Garoover about using hypnosis and drugs&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:22.880
on juvenile offenders and he did actually do&nbsp;
some kind of research at these two orphanages,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:28.160
but I don't know the exact nature of the research&nbsp;
except that it involved hypnosis in some form.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:34.080
But if if you think this is too much to believe,&nbsp;
there's no way that the CIA, the military would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:38.320
do experiments to create multiple personality&nbsp;
in children. That's just too off-the-wall and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:46.400
too bizarre. Uh it'd be helpful if you know what&nbsp;
actually is documented and what actually was done.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.240
And one of the most revered psychiatrists who had&nbsp;
her obituary in the American Journal of Psychiatry&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:59.200
recently is a woman named Loretta Bender. She was&nbsp;
a child psychiatrist and you could interview any&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:03.360
child psychiatrist around the country and he would&nbsp;
speak in glowing terms about her contribution to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:09.760
child psychiatry. In a publication uh that I have&nbsp;
on file that I photocopied that you can just get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:16.080
at the medical school library. It's not hard&nbsp;
to get. She describes giving LSD in uh dosages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:25.280
of 150 micrograms which is a big street level dose&nbsp;
for a kid to children aged 5 to 10 for days, weeks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:31.680
and sometimes months in a row. She also described&nbsp;
giving hallucinogenic doses of psilocybin which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:38.080
is the main compound in magic mushrooms to kids&nbsp;
as young as 5 years of age. So this network of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:43.840
doctors whose drugs were supplied either by&nbsp;
the CIA or the military or by drug companies&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:51.040
funded by the CIA and the military gave massive&nbsp;
doses of LSD and other hallucinogens to kids&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:59.920
uh five 6 7 8 years old and they would keep them&nbsp;
on uh full acid trips up to months in a row. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.320
this was documented in the journals at the time.&nbsp;
Yeah, it was published in the reg regular medical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.640
journals. You can just go to the library and&nbsp;
photocopy. And there was no outcry in the in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:15.600
profession against this. I mean, this sounds like&nbsp;
torture. No, it was just regarded as psychiatrist&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:20.320
doing research and trying to help kids. That's&nbsp;
the thing that's most amazing about all of this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:26.240
is you don't have to have a conspiracy theory. Uh,&nbsp;
and really conspiracy theories are interesting,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:31.920
but kind of beside the point. I think the thing&nbsp;
that's most amazing is that all this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:38.960
stuff is just straightforward everyday regular&nbsp;
activity of psychiatrists and psychologists. It&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:44.240
gets published. It gets presented at conferences&nbsp;
and nobody comments on it or gets outraged about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:49.120
it or does anything about it. Incredible. Another&nbsp;
thing, another type of research that's fully&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:53.920
documented and again if you know the references,&nbsp;
any medical school library has these references on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:59.360
file and you can go and photocopy them. There's&nbsp;
a whole body of research on brain electrode&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:06.080
implants. The main people who were doing that were&nbsp;
um this Jolly West tried to set up a program in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:10.800
u Los Angeles to do that which was approved&nbsp;
by Ronald Reagan but then got shut down by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:18.720
public protest. The main work was done at Tlane&nbsp;
University in New Orleans by Robert Heath, at Yale&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:26.880
by Joseé Delgato and at Harvard by a team that&nbsp;
included Frank Irvin and William. So these are the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:33.120
the major universities in the western world. What&nbsp;
they basically did was they would stick very fine&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:41.040
electrodes into a human being's brain often up&nbsp;
to 15 20 25 electrodes at one time and they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.920
stick them in specific centers in the brain or&nbsp;
specific areas in the brain. And then they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:51.600
stimulate the electrodes electrically through&nbsp;
wires and that would cause the electrode to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:58.000
discharge which would cause that part of the brain&nbsp;
to fire. And then uh Joseé Delgado at Yale made a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000
technical advance which was he invented a remote&nbsp;
transmitter box that in the 1960s had a range of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.840
up to 100 ft. So he could push a button on the&nbsp;
box that would transmit a signal to the electrode.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:16.240
There'd be a firing of the electrode and that part&nbsp;
of the brain would then get activated. And in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:22.560
u books and the papers that are published, he&nbsp;
describes also doing this in cats and in monkeys.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:28.320
And he refers to these monkeys as mechanical toys&nbsp;
because he could control their body movements and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:35.200
control their behavior. An example of what he did&nbsp;
with monkeys was he had uh a group of monkeys who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:40.240
are all in the same species living in a large&nbsp;
cage. And they have a dominance hierarchy. That&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:44.720
is they have a boss monkey who runs the whole show&nbsp;
and then they have a whole bunch of submissive&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:51.200
males and females. And in the normal setup, the&nbsp;
boss monkey has half the cage to himself and all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:56.560
the other monkeys get to use the other half. And&nbsp;
if they try and come in his space, then he gets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.600
mad or gets angry or beats them up or threatens&nbsp;
them or whatever. And this is just the sort of no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:07.040
normal social structure of these monkey troops.&nbsp;
What he did then was he implanted an electrode&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.480
in the brain of the boss monkey. And when he&nbsp;
pushed a certain button on his transmitter box,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:18.560
the boss monkey became completely passive. And so&nbsp;
the other monkeys started to figure this out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.480
would start getting bold and would come into his&nbsp;
part of the cage and would rough him up and not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:30.000
pay attention to him. And so the next step in the&nbsp;
experiments was he put a lever in the actual cage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.400
that the different monkeys could get their hands&nbsp;
on. They could press the lever. When they pressed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:39.600
the lever, it then transmitted a signal to the&nbsp;
electrode in the boss monkeyy's brain, making him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:45.840
be passive. So the other monkeys learned this. So&nbsp;
the other monkeys started practicing mind control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:51.440
on the boss monkey by pressing the lever to make&nbsp;
him have these seizures in this part of the brain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:55.280
that made him passive. They actually learned&nbsp;
how to control the boss monkey. And it shows&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:00.240
a picture of the other monkeys all over the cage&nbsp;
and not paying any attention to the boss monkey&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:06.480
at all. What he did then was he did this in human&nbsp;
beings, including children. And he describes an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:12.480
11-year-old boy that he put brain electrodes in.&nbsp;
And when he pressed the uh the right button on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:17.200
the box, the boy would start talking about&nbsp;
maybe being a girl and would start talking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:24.800
about wanting to marry a male therapist. So they&nbsp;
were using brain electrol implants to modify the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:32.160
identity and the worldview and the behavior of&nbsp;
uh children as young as 11. Incredible. Robert&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:37.600
Heath who who did the same sort of stuff at Tulain&nbsp;
University. There's a he actually describes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:44.400
same case in several different publications and&nbsp;
the guy's referred to as subject B19 and he was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:51.600
uh I forget if he was 18 or 20. He was in around&nbsp;
1820 maybe 19 and he was a homosexual guy and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:57.360
viewed homosexuality as a medical disease which&nbsp;
needed to be treated. So they put brain electrodes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:02.480
in this guy, one of which went into the area of&nbsp;
the brain called the septum, which was one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.920
pleasure centers of the brain. And then they would&nbsp;
push the button uh which would cause the electrode&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:15.120
to fire. And he would not have excuse me, not have&nbsp;
a full orgasm, but would be sort of 3/4 of the way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:21.360
to orgasm, feeling really really good as a result&nbsp;
of the button being pushed. And they they kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:25.520
of studied that and practiced it. And while they&nbsp;
were pushing the box, they would get him to watch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:31.520
heterosexual pornography films so that he would&nbsp;
be experiencing a near orgasm while he's watching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:38.320
heterosexual pornography. They were trying to&nbsp;
switch him over to being interested in women. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:43.200
then they did two further things. They set him&nbsp;
up with a little box of his own where he could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:48.880
push the button on the box himself. And they have&nbsp;
a chart of different three-hour periods and they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:54.000
show how many times he pushed the button himself.&nbsp;
He in one three-hour period got up to pushing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:01.200
button 1500 times to give himself an artificial&nbsp;
near orgasm. And then the final step they did in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:06.560
the research was they brought in a 20-year-old&nbsp;
prostitute. This is to the medical school and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:12.000
had her have sex with him. And while they were&nbsp;
having sex, they recorded the brain electrode&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:17.840
output because they it was a two-way communication&nbsp;
system. they could send a signal to the guy's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:23.520
brain to fire off that part of the brain or they&nbsp;
could just use the electrodes to monitor the brain&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:28.960
activity that was going on naturally. So they&nbsp;
actually took brain electrode activity recordings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:35.200
from deep inside his brain while he was having an&nbsp;
orgasm with this female prostitute. And then they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:43.040
report that over an 11-month period of follow-up,&nbsp;
he was mostly heterosexual with a few relapses.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:49.680
So this is just the the stuff that really went on.&nbsp;
A guy at uh Harvard who was part of the Harvard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:56.240
brain electrode team, his name was William. He&nbsp;
was um testifying at the recent hearings and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:00.240
there was a committee set up by Bill Clinton&nbsp;
to look into all the radiation experiments.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:04.800
The radiation experiments are all intertwined&nbsp;
and overlap with all this mind control stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:09.760
And Williamu, who was part of the brain electrode&nbsp;
team at Harvard, described injecting plutonium&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:17.440
into people at Harvard as part of um atomic energy&nbsp;
commission military and CIA radiation research.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:23.520
And he claimed that all of the subjects there gave&nbsp;
informed consent. But one of the subjects who was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:30.480
named HP12, I think HP was initials for human&nbsp;
product. So they referred to their experimental&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:36.400
subjects as human product and then they would&nbsp;
have a series of numbers. So this guy was HP12.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:41.360
He arrived at the emergency department at one of&nbsp;
the Boston hospitals which was part of the Harvard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:48.240
system unconscious and unidentified. He was&nbsp;
injected with plutonium obviously without giving&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:54.320
informed consent. And he died uh without regaining&nbsp;
consciousness and without being identified. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:50:54.320 --> 00:51:01.040
that didn't quite fit with the idea that everybody&nbsp;
gave informed consent. Mhm. And uh recently the uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:08.160
Clinton government uh approved a settlement of 4.8&nbsp;
million for just 12 of these plutonium subjects.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:12.000
There's probably hundreds and hundreds and&nbsp;
hundreds of them. And this was the outcome of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.240
presidential hearing on radiation experiments. But&nbsp;
what I think and what I'm going to start logging&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:21.680
for is that there should be another hearing on&nbsp;
the mind control side of things. Right. and uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:28.640
the mind control experiments were introduced uh&nbsp;
at the end of um the hearings. Um can you can you&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:34.400
talk about that? What what evidence was introduced&nbsp;
and what the response was by the US government?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:39.440
There was a number of different people. It was a&nbsp;
typical uh kind of presidential commission which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:45.680
is like the various commissions of inquiry that&nbsp;
go on in Canada where they receive all kinds of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.880
mail and correspondents and then they go around&nbsp;
the country having hearings that anybody can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:53.680
testify at and they had hearings in Washington&nbsp;
that people went down to. So there's a number of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:51:53.680 --> 00:52:00.880
people who testified about um two aspects of this.&nbsp;
the documented stuff like I've been describing and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:05.840
then the memories of individual patients of&nbsp;
stuff that they claim has gone on which isn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:12.320
documented. So the the things that uh I know for&nbsp;
sure went on and include that includes went on in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:20.000
Canada were use of hallucinogens uh implantation&nbsp;
of these brain electrodes massive uses of electric&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.840
shock and that's electric shock is an ECT&nbsp;
treatment to make you have a seizure and also&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:31.600
just electric shock to different parts of your&nbsp;
body as part of behavior modification. um sensory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:36.880
deprivation experiments where people were kept in&nbsp;
chambers for uh long periods of time until they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:44.960
started hallucinating. Um uh you Cameron who's&nbsp;
the best known CIA contractor in Cameron did a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:50.160
what's called psychic driving where he would make&nbsp;
people listen to tape loops for literally hours&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:55.760
and hours and hours and hours and hours per day&nbsp;
with repeated messages trying to modify their way&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:02.400
of thinking. So all of these different elements&nbsp;
have been used absolutely totally documented in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:09.200
stuff that's published in medical school library&nbsp;
type journals. Mhm. One of my sort of favorite and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:14.880
most bizarre series of experiments like that was&nbsp;
done at the University of Minnesota by a man named&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:21.840
Amado Morazzi who had an Air Force grant for LSD&nbsp;
research while at the University of Minnesota and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:28.400
previous to that he was the uh one of the sort&nbsp;
of administrative managerial guys at Edgeware&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:35.760
Arsenal for their mind control research. uh he&nbsp;
besides just giving people LSD and so on he made&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:42.720
use of what's called the Ames leaf room that's&nbsp;
am a guy named Ames developed this room funded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:48.240
by the office of naval research which is heavily&nbsp;
involved in all this mind control research themes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:53.840
leaf room is uh has different forms can either&nbsp;
be a room that's usually built out of plywood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:53:53.840 --> 00:54:00.400
that's got walls that are at all kinds of weird&nbsp;
angles or this particular room was cubic So it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:08.400
a just a normal shaped kind of cube and you would&nbsp;
sit inside the room stuck one side would have no&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:12.800
wall at all. It would be open and that's a side&nbsp;
that you would be looking into and you would be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:18.640
sitting just inside the room so that you couldn't&nbsp;
see anything except the walls and then the entire&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:24.480
room was lined with leaves. So leaves were glued&nbsp;
to all the walls. So there you are in this sort&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:30.560
of environment where you can't exactly see where&nbsp;
the corners are because of all these leaves. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:36.720
then when you're in the Ames leaf room either in&nbsp;
the research by Ames or this guy at University of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:43.440
Minnesota, you would put on special glasses called&nbsp;
anchonic lenses. And the anoconic lenses would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:49.120
distort all of the angles. So like the ceiling&nbsp;
would be sort of coming down at you. The floor&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:54.320
would be slam sliding some other weird angle. One&nbsp;
wall would be coming in at you and the other wall&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:59.440
going away. The leaves on one side of the room&nbsp;
would be all big and coming out at you and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:04.080
leaves on the other side would be kind of flat and&nbsp;
receding. And all of the different perspectives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:10.720
didn't fit together properly. And then the subject&nbsp;
who's sitting in there looking through these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:17.440
lenses has a little control mechanism to control&nbsp;
a bar that's at the far end of the room to try and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:23.200
set it to horizontal. And it shows a photograph of&nbsp;
this guy sitting in there and the bar is like at a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:29.920
40° angle, but he thinks it's horizontal. And then&nbsp;
the extra twist that Morazzi did was while he had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:36.320
these people sitting in the Ames leaf room with&nbsp;
these weird goggles on, he gave them LSD. That's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:44.480
all done on Air Force contracts. So this is pretty&nbsp;
weird and bizarre stuff. Yeah. Um what uh what if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:49.360
any was the US government's response to the test&nbsp;
specifically the mind control experimentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:56.480
testimony at the um hearings on uh radiation?&nbsp;
Uh they just kind of acknowledged it and really&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:02.560
didn't comment or do much of anything with it. So&nbsp;
nothing has been done to follow up. Not nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:07.680
systematic that I'm aware of. No. Right. I just&nbsp;
want to go back to uh when you were talking about&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:07.680 --> 00:56:13.120
brain implants. Um, have you have you or other&nbsp;
therapists come across direct evidence of implants&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:22.480
in clients? Uh, nothing really conclusive. There's&nbsp;
kind of a a conspiracy literature about that that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:27.520
exists that you can see find on the internet&nbsp;
and find in various publications and so on where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:33.680
people will show x-rays and they there always&nbsp;
is somewhere in the x-ray what is supposed to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:40.400
be an implant but it's kind of vague usually&nbsp;
and not really absolutely documented. I don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.920
think that's because it's not going on. I think&nbsp;
it's just because the documentation hasn't been&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:49.760
fished out yet. I haven't myself uh had a patient&nbsp;
who comes in for treatment and I've been able to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:54.080
document that there's implants in this person's&nbsp;
brain. So the documented evidence indicates that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:56:54.080 --> 00:57:01.600
they're able to use implants for control purposes&nbsp;
and also to receive information from a person's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:07.200
brain. Is that correct? Guy Jolly West who is the&nbsp;
expert witness for uh Patty Hurst who is also the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:12.480
military and CIA contractor who's an expert on&nbsp;
multiple personality and different things. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:19.680
actually mentions multiple personality in his CIA&nbsp;
MK Ultra proposal. uh he tried to set up this UCLA&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:24.000
violence center that was going to be funded by&nbsp;
Ronald Reagan and Frank Irvin from the Harvard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.600
brain electrode implant team was going to come and&nbsp;
one of the uh things that was going to be done at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:34.560
the UCLA violence project and also was going to&nbsp;
be done at Vakavville State Prison under separate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:39.360
administrative structure but which got shut down&nbsp;
by public protest was they were going to implant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:45.840
brain electrodes in violent uh sex offenders and&nbsp;
then they were going to do two things. They were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:50.400
going to use the electrodes as kind of like a&nbsp;
electronic bracelet inside the person's head. So&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:55.040
they were going to monitor the person's location&nbsp;
because of transmissions from the implanted&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:59.600
electrodes and then they would know if the person&nbsp;
had gone out of this is after their discharge&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:04.720
from prison. They would know if the person had&nbsp;
gone outside their restricted area. Also they&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:09.840
would be able to monitor the person's level of&nbsp;
sexual arousal through the brain electrodes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:14.960
So if the guy was outside his restricted area&nbsp;
and was starting to get sexually aroused, what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:21.360
they would do would be then transmit a signal to&nbsp;
him that would just paralyze him. And one of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:25.200
uh things that was going to be done at the&nbsp;
UCLA violence project and also was going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:30.880
done at Vakavville State Prison under a separate&nbsp;
administrative structure but which got shut down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:36.880
by public protest was they were going to implant&nbsp;
brain electrodes in violent uh sex offenders and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:41.600
then they were going to do two things. They were&nbsp;
going to use the electrodes as kind of like a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:46.720
electronic bracelet inside the person's head. So&nbsp;
they were going to monitor the person's location&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:50.800
because of transmissions from the implanted&nbsp;
electrodes and then they would know if the person&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:55.520
had gone out of this is after their discharge&nbsp;
from prison. They would know if the person had&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:58:55.520 --> 00:59:01.440
gone outside their restricted area. Also they&nbsp;
would be able to monitor the person's level of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:06.720
sexual arousal through the brain electrodes. And&nbsp;
so if the guy was outside his restricted area and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:11.600
was starting to get sexually aroused, what they&nbsp;
would do would be then transmit a signal to him&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:17.920
that would just paralyze him, just make him like&nbsp;
go catatonic or stop in his tracks and not move.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:23.120
And then they would notify the police who would&nbsp;
go pick him up. And the there's a book called&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:29.360
Violence in the Brain by two of these Harvard&nbsp;
brain electrode people. and they discuss maybe&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:35.600
using these kind of electrodes to deal with people&nbsp;
who are w rioting like the Watts riots and so on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:41.520
that were going on at that time. So there was a&nbsp;
whole scheme about how we were going to control&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:46.560
bad people in the population that we didn't&nbsp;
like and and this is their own uh literature&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.720
and own documentation that uh you're getting&nbsp;
this information from. This is all completely&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:57.440
published, objective, real, exists type stuff.&nbsp;
And does it go into detail about uh how the the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:59:57.440 --> 01:00:05.200
uh um electronic delivery mechanism is it by&nbsp;
satellite or by some kind of radio that they would&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:11.040
receive and send signals? Yeah, some um I don't&nbsp;
know a whole lot about the technical side of it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:17.600
but it was uh this is back in the 60s and 70s, so&nbsp;
they wouldn't have been doing satellite uplinks&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:23.680
on that at that point yet. Uh it would be some&nbsp;
sort of line of sight radio beam of some kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:30.320
Another thing that uh also is documented in um&nbsp;
there's a journal called Defense Electronics in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:37.920
the July 1993 issue. Uh there's a one-page article&nbsp;
there that describes technology that's under&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:45.040
development. There's a Russian guy who specializes&nbsp;
in this stuff. His name is Igor Smirnov. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.960
basically technology for beaming different forms&nbsp;
of radiation at people's heads. can either and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:57.840
there's about four or five MK Ultra projects that&nbsp;
were on this kind of stuff. So, it can be either a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:06.400
sound energy uh percussion sound percussion waves&nbsp;
uh or different types of light and radio frequency&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:12.640
and all kinds of different types of energy. So,&nbsp;
the Igor Smirnov is a specialist in this kind of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:18.800
stuff who has technology that he's developed. He&nbsp;
was brought has technology that he's developed. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:28.640
was brought over in um March of 1993 to a meeting&nbsp;
in Northern Virginia that was attended by the CIA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:33.600
the Defense Intelligence Agency. I think I&nbsp;
remember the list, right? One of these might be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:38.880
wrong, but definitely the CIA, definitely the FBI,&nbsp;
I think the Defense Intelligence Agency, I think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:44.000
the National Security Agency, a representative&nbsp;
from General Electronics, and a representative&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:48.800
from one of the universities who all got&nbsp;
together to discuss the possibility of using this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:54.720
technology on David Kuresh and this was during&nbsp;
the branch devidian siege. And according to the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:01.200
article, the reason they decided not to use this&nbsp;
technology on him was uh problems with software&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:07.920
compatibility between the Russian software and&nbsp;
the American hardware. And what happened as an&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:15.120
upshot at the meeting was that a term called a&nbsp;
firm called Psycho Technologies that's based in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:20.720
uh in Virginia, I forget which town in Virginia,&nbsp;
actually contracted with the Russians to develop&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:26.640
this kind of technology for possible American&nbsp;
usage. So that's all stuff that's actually real&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:32.400
that's actually going on that's undergoing some&nbsp;
sort of research and development. Currently in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:38.320
uh MK Ultra projects, they also describe&nbsp;
implanting brain electrodes in various kinds&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:44.640
of animals including dolphins and using them&nbsp;
as delivery systems for biological and chemical&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:51.600
weapons. So that's actually in the CIA materials&nbsp;
and they describe further research to fine-tune&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.880
those kind of systems that were already&nbsp;
in successful operational use. Do you have&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:02.720
evidence of DIA involvement in the mind control&nbsp;
experiments? Have you been able to get any DIA&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:08.720
documentation? The for listeners that don't know,&nbsp;
the DIA is the Defense Intelligence Agency. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.520
I understand that's the DIA is something like uh&nbsp;
10 times the size of the CIA as well. Actually,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:19.840
the CIA, the the director of the CIA controls&nbsp;
only about 10% of the financial assets of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:25.440
American intelligence community, meaning that the&nbsp;
CIA is really a tiny fragment of all of military&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.920
and civilian intelligence in the United States.&nbsp;
The National Security Agency and the Defense&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:37.120
Intelligence Agency are both quite a bit bigger.&nbsp;
Um, the answer to your question is yes and no. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:45.280
no part is I don't have uh direct documentation of&nbsp;
defense intelligence agency mind control contracts&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:49.200
but it's really kind of beside the point&nbsp;
because all of these intelligence agencies&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:56.400
are all interconnected with each other right for&nbsp;
instance the CIA had two programs MK Ultra and MK&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:06.080
Naomi and they uh got federal funds which they&nbsp;
then put into MK Naomi and NK Naomi then funded&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:11.440
uh the special operations division at Fort&nbsp;
Detectric and Edgeware Arsenal to do mind control&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:17.360
research. So, and that's the way it is with the&nbsp;
radiation experiments too. The atomic energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.880
commission, health, education, welfare, the CIA,&nbsp;
all kinds of different government agencies are all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:30.640
interlin and interconnected. One of the um Defense&nbsp;
Intelligence Agency programs was called Stargate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:36.080
There was a liaison between the CIA and the&nbsp;
Defense Intelligence Agency on that. It was just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:46.400
declassified about roughly within the last year.&nbsp;
Um, and there was a a program on in December on uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:53.760
ABC TV, ABC's Night Line program in December where&nbsp;
Bill Gates, who was a former head of the CIA,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:04:53.760 --> 01:05:00.000
one of the guys who was the CIA person who was in&nbsp;
responsible for less on between the CIA and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.160
military on Stargate and one of the guys who was&nbsp;
a Stargate contractor all talking about Stargate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:11.760
uh which they admitted ran up until at least&nbsp;
1984 and had funding of at least $20 million,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:17.840
which is probably just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp;
And Stargate was a remote viewing program. So the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:23.760
intelligence agencies all in an interconnected&nbsp;
fashion uh spent millions of dollars on remote&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:29.360
viewing, which is basically having psychics lie&nbsp;
down on a table and try and see what's going on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:35.040
at some location in a foreign country to gather&nbsp;
intelligence information. There's a book that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:43.840
just published by um uh something Joseph Michael&nbsp;
Joseph I think it is which is a branch of Penguin&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:48.960
and British branch of Penguin books called Psychic&nbsp;
Warrior where a guy describes being one of these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:55.360
remote viewers. A lot of that work was done at&nbsp;
the Stanford Research Institute in uh PaloAlto,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:01.600
California. So I mentioned that partly because&nbsp;
it's interesting partly because if you think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:07.920
that creating multiple personality disorder&nbsp;
is too bizarre and strange to be real. Again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:14.320
you have to look at this LSD, this brain electrode&nbsp;
research, some of the sensory deprivation that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:20.720
Ames leaf room with those anisonic lenses using uh&nbsp;
millions and millions and millions of dollars to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:27.040
pay psychics to spy on other countries while lying&nbsp;
on tables in the United States. Once you have that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:34.400
context, then creating multiple personality just&nbsp;
seems kind of small. Now what what is like uh I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:41.040
understand that the what's driving this was the&nbsp;
cold war uh you know back from the information&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:46.640
that we've got back late that's true and not&nbsp;
true right but let me explain why it's true&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:53.120
and not true okay just briefly that's actually&nbsp;
a disinformation setup the term brainwashing was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:53.120 --> 01:06:59.280
invented by uh a man named Edward Hunter who wrote&nbsp;
a book about brainwashing in the early 1950s that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:06.080
I have a copy of. So he invented that term and&nbsp;
described how the um American pilots and prisoners&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:11.280
of war in the Korean War who were captured by&nbsp;
the Chinese and then were made to sign false germ&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:16.720
warfare confessions and were converted to being&nbsp;
communists had been brainwashed. And then the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:21.680
whole idea was that the CIA and other intelligence&nbsp;
agencies had to figure out how that happened. and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:27.840
Jolly West, Margaret Singer, and Robert Lifton&nbsp;
who testified at the Patty Hurst trial. They all&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:32.560
interviewed these returning prisoners of war&nbsp;
in the Korean War and became experts on mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:38.800
control and cult thought reform techniques and so&nbsp;
on. So, the idea was that because the communists&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:43.600
were doing that, we had to figure out how to&nbsp;
combat that. So, it was mainly defensive and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:50.720
it was reactive to what the communist Chinese&nbsp;
were doing. But that's not true. uh because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:56.800
GHBs was already doing that stuff in the second&nbsp;
world war or you know way before the Korean war.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:03.440
So actually there was an offensive program of mind&nbsp;
control by the OSS and other intelligence agencies&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:08.960
uh 10 years before the Korean War. So the whole&nbsp;
idea that it was got started because of the cold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:16.240
war is disinformation but then it obviously got&nbsp;
fueled and entrenched by the cold war. And then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:20.080
the question becomes well the cold war is over.&nbsp;
Why do we need that stuff anymore? Right? And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:26.240
I think the answer is severalfold. One is we in&nbsp;
fact do need to have intelligence agencies. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:32.320
world is not a safe place. And for us not to be&nbsp;
living in Siberia and getting sent to labor camps&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:37.200
in Siberia, we've got to protect ourselves from&nbsp;
all kinds of forces in the world. And to do that,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:42.800
we have to have intelligence agencies. So I I&nbsp;
have no beef with the CIA as such or the existence&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:47.440
of intelligence agencies. I think they're&nbsp;
essential to maintaining freedom and democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.520
But once you've got intelligence agencies, you&nbsp;
got the military and you got a bunch of budgets,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:59.200
you got people who like any federal bureaucrats&nbsp;
have to justify their exper their budgets and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:04.320
their programs and everything. You got people&nbsp;
who are already into this and you've got actual&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:11.120
applications of it. And so it it'll just carry on,&nbsp;
I think, indefinitely. And the fact that the Cold&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:17.040
War is over, I don't see as being a major item&nbsp;
in this stuff stopping. Now you mentioned in your&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:22.720
previous lecture that you as you said you don't&nbsp;
blame the CIA per se but uh the psychiatrists&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:28.960
and doctors that are involved in this. Do you not&nbsp;
feel that the CIA is uh hold some responsibility&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:34.400
in funding and allowing the uh the doctors and&nbsp;
psychiatrists to operate? Oh absolutely. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:40.560
Like these people definitely were I mean the&nbsp;
victims of all of this definitely did not give&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:46.480
informed consent. Uh definitely it was unethical.&nbsp;
It was harmful. there was damages, they deserve&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:52.080
compensation and the federal government's on&nbsp;
the hook for that. And so the idea is not that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:58.640
I'm sort of soft on the CIA or apologetic for&nbsp;
them. It's just that I'm basically psychiatrist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:04.480
right? So my number one concern is with all&nbsp;
this bizarre, unethical, destructive conduct by&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:09.760
my colleagues and the medical ethics of it and&nbsp;
getting the medical profession under control.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:15.200
So what I think needs to happen is that it&nbsp;
should no longer be allowed that psychiatrist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:20.960
psychologists, doctors have funding from the&nbsp;
CIA or the military without the subjects of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:27.040
research knowing where the money is coming from&nbsp;
and knowing that it's not really medical research&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:33.440
as such. It's military intelligence warfare,&nbsp;
psychological warfare, mind control research.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:40.160
um in some of the literature uh seems to suggest&nbsp;
that Canada was offered up to supply so-called&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:45.840
guinea pigs for the US mind control experiments.&nbsp;
Um I'm particularly referring to um the Al&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:51.200
Memorial at McGill University in Montreal with Dr.&nbsp;
Cameron. What do you think has Canada's role been&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:57.440
in in the US military mind control experiments?&nbsp;
Well, the uh Canadian Psychiatric Association&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:02.560
um put out some disinformation that's been&nbsp;
pretty well bought by the Canadian public&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:08.000
and that is that you and Cameron, it was just an&nbsp;
isolated incident. Happened a long time ago back&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.800
in the ' 50s that he had CIA funding. There were&nbsp;
sort of different ethical standards back then.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:17.200
Of course, we wouldn't approve it now, but it was&nbsp;
just a one-time deal and he was such a great man,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:22.080
we can overlook it. Well, that's not true because&nbsp;
that research completely violated the ethical&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:27.760
standards of the time. But also, it wasn't an&nbsp;
isolated incident. In fact, you Cameron wasn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:34.000
even the only person at McGill at that time with&nbsp;
CIA funding. Dr. Raymond Prince was funded through&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:42.240
MK Ultra sub project 121 to do um anthropological&nbsp;
psychiatry research in Nigeria. He didn't know at&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:48.240
the time it was CIA money. Donald Heb who is the&nbsp;
chairman of the department of psychology there did&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:54.960
a lot of sensory deprivation experiments funded&nbsp;
by Canada's defense research board when the CIA&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.520
stopped funding you and Cameron's work health&nbsp;
education and welfare Canada just picked it up&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:04.160
and continued this incredibly unethical harmful&nbsp;
destructive research that wiped out people's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:11.040
memories for their whole lives um there's a man&nbsp;
named Hassan Azima who is a psychiatrist who died&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:16.480
of cancer in his early 40s who was being groomed&nbsp;
assumed to be a mind control researcher who was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:24.080
doing LSD and sensory deprivation experiments at&nbsp;
McGill and who was presenting u at conferences&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:30.400
where all these other military and CIA funded&nbsp;
people were at. So he was in the loop. Um James&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:38.400
Tyhurst who in 1951 was part of a committee&nbsp;
meeting to oversee Bluebird and Artichoke in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:45.440
Canada before you and Cameron got his money. uh&nbsp;
was also uh funded by Canada's defense research&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:53.360
board. He did LSD research also at MC Hollywood&nbsp;
Hospital in Vancouver and uh doctor named Ross&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:59.520
Mlan who was a director at Hollywood Hospital in&nbsp;
Vancouver attended a CIA sponsored LSD symposium&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:07.280
and described giving LSD to 338 different patients&nbsp;
at Hollywood Hospital. So there's a lot of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:15.040
military LSD flowing into Vancouver. Then Abram&nbsp;
Hoffer and Humphrey Osman did a lot of military&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:21.600
LSD research in Saskatchewan. And Humphrey&nbsp;
Osman then left and moved down to the New Jersey&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:27.120
neurosychiatric institute in Pennsylvania where&nbsp;
Carl Feifer was which is where the Louis Castillo&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:33.200
guy was who was over in the Philippines and got&nbsp;
arrested by the FBI over there. So there's been&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:40.240
a lot of connections with Canadian psychiatry. A&nbsp;
spin-off of all of that. Some of the research is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:45.200
funded by the military or the CIA or whoever&nbsp;
and then that gets published and presented&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.120
at conferences and talked about and then other&nbsp;
civilian psychiatrists who aren't directly funded&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:55.840
by the CIA start doing the same kind of stuff. Hm.&nbsp;
An example of that was at uh Penitentanglishing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:02.400
Hospital which is the up on Lake Hiron there where&nbsp;
there's a basically a heavy duty facility for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:09.280
people who are criminally insane, not guilty by&nbsp;
reason of insanity, unfit to stand trial. In the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:16.960
years about 1968-69, there's four papers published&nbsp;
in the Canadian Psychiatric Association Journal,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:20.560
which you can go to any of the medical school&nbsp;
libraries in Canada and just pull it off the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:26.560
shelf and read it. This psychiatrist named Elliot&nbsp;
Barker, who's still alive, was working there. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:33.760
invented a little room called the capsule that was&nbsp;
about 8 by 10 ft. He would put prisoners as young&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:41.840
as 15 going up into early 30s in this capsule in&nbsp;
groups of either two up to uh seven at a time for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:49.680
periods of days up to as 11 days at a time all&nbsp;
naked and often on LSD. So there's all these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:55.040
violent offenders, murderers, arsonists, rapists&nbsp;
and so on. And he would have them in this little&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:14:55.040 --> 01:15:00.800
small capsule all naked on LSD kind of doing&nbsp;
rap sessions and therapy groups with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:08.560
And the um room would be monitored by other&nbsp;
prisoners through the uh either video link&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:14.080
or camera link or through a mirror in the ceiling&nbsp;
and other prisoners were responsible for supplying&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:19.760
them food and so on. There was a one toilet inside&nbsp;
the capsule and they would be signaled to change&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:24.480
from one kind of therapy group to another by&nbsp;
changing the kind color of the light that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:30.320
shown into the room. So they were in this kind of&nbsp;
group sensory deprivation with changing colored&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:36.880
lights and um the idea was that this would get&nbsp;
through their defenses and then get to the real&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:44.160
stuff and do real therapy. One of the co-authors&nbsp;
on one of these patients is an HM Mason who's at&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.680
the bottom of the paper it says that he was a&nbsp;
patient at this Oakidge facility in Penitentang&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:53.840
on a ward called F-Ward that a documentary was&nbsp;
made about it by the CBC. actually have a copy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:15:53.840 --> 01:16:00.160
of a video of it. So, this HM is both one of these&nbsp;
patients who are all murderers and arsonists and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:06.000
rapists and so on who's in this capsule getting&nbsp;
LSD and he's also a co-author on the paper. And&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:14.160
then apparently uh several of the former inmates&nbsp;
lived with Elliot Barker post discharge. And this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:21.760
uh HM Mason, as far as I can tell, is the&nbsp;
same guy as Hank Mason. Hank Mason is on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:26.640
the web page of the Canadian Society for the&nbsp;
Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.960
um just what it says. It's Canadian Society for&nbsp;
Prevention of Cruelty to the Children. The current&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:38.480
president is Elliot Barker. And this Hank Mason&nbsp;
has got a who is identified as a founding member&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:44.560
of the society has a little statement about child&nbsp;
abuse on the web page. So it would appear that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:49.200
Canadian Society for the Prevention of Cruelty&nbsp;
of the Children has had executive members who&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:56.080
are former uh violent criminals in a facility&nbsp;
for the criminally insane currently being run by&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.000
psychiatrists who did all this kind of research&nbsp;
who published it in the Canadian Psychiatric&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:05.200
Association journal. Interesting. Just the kind of&nbsp;
stuff that it goes on and on and on and on and on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:09.520
with more stories like this. What's your sense&nbsp;
of how many Canadian centers and doctors that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:17.680
were involved in the experimentations? Uh well,&nbsp;
absolute minimum of 5 to 10. Mhm. Centers or&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:24.800
uh doctors and centers? Yeah. Okay. I mean for&nbsp;
sure there was McGill um Wurn Saskatchewan and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:33.280
University of Saskatchewan, Hollywood Hospital,&nbsp;
um another hospital in Montreal where LS Divas.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:36.400
I think I forget if it was Montreal General.&nbsp;
I think it was Montreal general, but I'm not&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:42.160
sure about that. I have it documented somewhere.&nbsp;
Then the same kind of stuff apparently not funded&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:48.640
by the military or intelligence was community was&nbsp;
going on at Penitentang. Is there any indication&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:54.800
that uh experiments were being done on military&nbsp;
bases themselves? Uh not documented evidence, but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:17:54.800 --> 01:18:02.320
there's quite a few accounts from patients that&nbsp;
are unverified. Yeah. Right. Um you mentioned that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:08.320
like some of the uh doctors that were involved in&nbsp;
this research were unwitting. What uh what kind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:15.920
of funding uh um institutes were set up to fund&nbsp;
this kind of research to unwitting doctors? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:20.880
they use what they called cutouts. A cutout is&nbsp;
a front funding organization. The three major&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:28.640
ones were the human ecology foundation, the Josiah&nbsp;
Macy Jr. Foundation and the Kashikar Medical Fund.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:33.760
So each of these would be funded from the CIA and&nbsp;
then in turn they would fund right and the people&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.800
who were running those organizations knew that it&nbsp;
was CIA money and often themselves got grants from&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:44.240
the CIA. One of the guys who was on the board of&nbsp;
the human ecology foundation who reviewed grants&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:49.360
for the human ecology foundation and himself got&nbsp;
an MK Ultra grant and had top secret clearance&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:55.760
was Carl Rogers. That's kind of amazing because&nbsp;
Carl Rogers is best known for client- centered&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:03.200
therapy which is a kind of humanistic valuing&nbsp;
the spiritual worth of the client kind of therapy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:09.680
where you have to have uh accurate empathy&nbsp;
unconditional positive regard for the person&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:19.200
and genuine uh empathy. So it's a it's like the&nbsp;
stereotype most humanistic touchyfey psychotherapy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:28.400
going and he was actually uh top secret cleared&nbsp;
and funding secret CI mind control research.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:36.560
Now, there's a lot of uh doctors and uh some&nbsp;
therapists out there that um dismiss the idea&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:42.480
of of multiple personalities. And um um one&nbsp;
of the things that some of these people are&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:47.120
saying is that it's doesn't exist and that&nbsp;
it's actually temporal lobe epilepsy. What&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:52.960
is temporal lobe epilepsy and and how is it&nbsp;
similar to MPD? Well, temporal lobe epilepsy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:57.520
is just a form of epilepsy that takes place&nbsp;
in the temporal lobe of your brain. So there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:02.720
abnormal electrical discharges that cause you to&nbsp;
have a seizure. A typical temporal lobe seizure&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:09.840
invol lasts for 30 to 90 seconds. You may become&nbsp;
unconscious or just get a kind of foggy state of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:16.080
consciousness and you'll usually like fumble&nbsp;
at one of your buttons or smack your lips or&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:24.320
turn your body in a very kind of mechanistic over&nbsp;
and over same little motion kind of way and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:29.680
you pop out of it after 30 seconds usually. So&nbsp;
temporal load epilepsy is completely unrelated&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:34.240
to multiple personality disorder. That's just a&nbsp;
bogus prejudice. And there's a bunch of research&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.880
that I and others have done that show that the&nbsp;
symptom picture of temporal epilepsy and multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.960
personality are completely different from each&nbsp;
other. Why why would these people be making these&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:49.040
claims? What what would be, you know, why the&nbsp;
confusion? Uh because they're they don't take&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:54.480
accurate histories. They're very vague about what&nbsp;
they say and they just look grasping at straws&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:20:54.480 --> 01:21:00.560
for some way to discredit multiple personality.&nbsp;
Basically, the the more serious criticism is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:06.400
multiple personality is often unwittingly created&nbsp;
by bad therapists. No, that I agree with and I've&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:11.920
actually testified about that in court that&nbsp;
in cases where I'm testifying for the patient&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:16.240
who's suing the therapist and I'm stating as&nbsp;
an expert witness that yes, this was created&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:20.800
by the therapist and yes, all these memories were&nbsp;
false and yes, it did all this harm. Now, this is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:27.040
a very complex issue and one that's being hotly&nbsp;
debated by the public. Um, the the main thing is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:31.840
that there actually is a whole bunch of science&nbsp;
about multiple personality and dissociation. It's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:37.520
not just a matter of belief. There's a a big&nbsp;
literature now that has flaws in it and so on,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:42.240
but there's actually a whole bunch of science.&nbsp;
It's not just I believe or I don't believe. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:47.760
the curious twist in the logic is that actually&nbsp;
I think that all of this uh documentation that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.320
the military and the CIA have been creating&nbsp;
experimental multiple personality and using&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:58.560
it in operations actually proves that multiple&nbsp;
personality is real. It proves two things. One&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:04.320
is that unless they're just wasting money, they're&nbsp;
not going to bother with the whole exercise unless&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:08.800
you actually can create a new identity that&nbsp;
actually is hidden behind a real memory barrier.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:12.880
Otherwise, there'll be no point, right? And that&nbsp;
could be that could be used operationally, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:19.120
So then the none of it's actually really really&nbsp;
really real. It's all illusions inside your mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:24.240
There isn't literally another person in there,&nbsp;
but nobody in the multiple personality field is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:28.960
saying that it's literally real anyway to start&nbsp;
with. But you can create this artificial second&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.560
identity and it can actually do stuff that the&nbsp;
main part of the person doesn't remember. That has&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:40.080
to be true otherwise there would be no point in&nbsp;
creating it for military use. And so that proves&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:46.240
two things. One is that it's possible to create&nbsp;
multiple personality by a mistake in a bad therapy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:52.080
that mimics a lot of the conditions of military&nbsp;
mind control or cult mind control. But also if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:58.720
have a disorder that can be created deliberately&nbsp;
either be by the CIA, by a destructive cult, by a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:04.400
therapist who doesn't really know what they're&nbsp;
doing or even by the person themselves, then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:09.440
it's not really a big jump to imagine that that it&nbsp;
could also happen just naturally and spontaneously&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:15.200
as a way of coping with trauma. Right. So the very&nbsp;
fact that you can create it artificially to me&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:19.760
indicates that it can be created artificially by&nbsp;
mistake or on purpose and also that it's likely to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:26.480
happen naturally. Well, the other question is&nbsp;
h how they managed to create it artificially.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:32.320
Um and is it a traumatic I'm writing about all&nbsp;
this now. I have a number of case histories that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:37.600
describe it in quite a lot of detail. There's a&nbsp;
the there's a lot of information about how they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:43.360
created Tanya and Patty Hurst. It's very detailed.&nbsp;
There's a very good case from Denmark. A guy named&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:52.000
Pali Hardrop who was uh in jail in the let's&nbsp;
see now late 40s in Denmark. Another prisoner&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:58.000
named Bujornne Nielsen used a whole lot of mind&nbsp;
control and hypnosis techniques and created this&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.040
uh and music bank robber and pi hardrip actually&nbsp;
went out and robbed a bank and then he robbed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:07.680
another bank tried to rob a second bank shot&nbsp;
two people didn't get away with any money got&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:15.040
captured and the net outcome of the huge trial&nbsp;
with 50 witnesses and all kinds of psychiatric&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:20.240
testimony and so on. The net outcome of it was&nbsp;
that this Bejorn Nielsen guy was found guilty and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:20.240 --> 01:24:26.000
sentenced to jail even though he wasn't physically&nbsp;
present at any of the robberies and Pali Hardrop&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:32.320
was found kind of an equivalent of not guilty by&nbsp;
reason of insanity and they ex specifically said&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:38.560
at the trial all the experts did that this Bejorn&nbsp;
Neielson guy used hypnosis and other methods to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:44.720
create a split identity hardrip. So these kind of&nbsp;
cases have actually come to trial and there's a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:49.520
lot of detail on them. What what would these other&nbsp;
methods be and what would the links be between&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:55.360
the methods used for create artificially creating&nbsp;
multiple personalities and childhood trauma? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.000
the links are severalfold. One is you have to&nbsp;
have a pretty good control over the person's life&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:06.240
space. You can't just see them for half an hour,&nbsp;
an hour a week and that's all that's required.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:11.920
So in the palihardy case, these two guys were&nbsp;
salemates, cellmates and also they worked in&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:18.160
the same workshop and were basically with each&nbsp;
other constantly for about 18 months. Uh if you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:22.720
can isolate the person from the outside world&nbsp;
from contact with other people who are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:27.280
to be critical of what's going on or give a&nbsp;
different point of view that's helpful. These&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:33.600
are these things apply to destructive cults and&nbsp;
also deliberate creation of multiple personality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:41.680
Then if you can uh use all kinds of thought reform&nbsp;
techniques that is getting the person to study&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:50.240
doctrine do all kinds of meditation exercises,&nbsp;
chanting exercises, hypnotic focusing exercises,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:54.720
internal dream imagery exercises, you get their&nbsp;
mind kind of into a trance state and focused on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:25:54.720 --> 01:26:02.080
what you want them to believe and focus on. Then&nbsp;
you actually use formal hypnosis some or drugs and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:05.760
then you deliberately instruct them that you&nbsp;
want to create a second identity and then you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:12.320
figure out what is it that this person's going&nbsp;
to be motivated by. So in the pali hardrip case&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:19.600
uh this bejorn neielson guy created uh guardian&nbsp;
spirit x and whenever bejorn neielson was speaking&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:24.960
to pi hardrop it was actually ex who was talking&nbsp;
through bejorn neielsen and he got pi hardup to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:29.920
buy into that cuz he was interested in all&nbsp;
kinds of new age type stuff and then uh ex&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:35.440
started teaching him the path to enlightenment&nbsp;
and so the basic motivator was that he was going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:40.480
to get to enlightenment and if he didn't follow&nbsp;
follow the doctrine, didn't follow the rules,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:45.600
didn't follow all the tests, and didn't perform&nbsp;
adequately, then he would lose X and he would lose&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:51.120
his path to enlightenment. And that was the thing&nbsp;
that he was most obsessed with. So that was the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:57.280
carrot that kept him going. So you have to find&nbsp;
some sort of carrot that'll keep the person going.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:03.440
And then uh you can use uh any number of&nbsp;
different kinds of behavior modification&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:09.360
techniques which could be uh punishing the person&nbsp;
if they say what you don't want them to say,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:15.360
rewarding them if they say what you do want&nbsp;
them to say. And it I mean I could go on with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.600
the list a little bit but basically you have to&nbsp;
get control over the person's thoughts over their&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:25.440
life space and you have to set up a reward and&nbsp;
punishment system to steer them along the path&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:29.600
you want so that they become kind of robots who&nbsp;
just repeat the doctrine that you want and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:36.000
if you want to create the second identity you&nbsp;
can use uh all kinds of threats or you can use&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.920
actual trauma and fear and the trauma and the fear&nbsp;
and the agitation the upset drive the splitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:47.280
of the mind. just naturally cuz the human mind&nbsp;
tends to split or dissociate in some way to cope&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:53.360
with trauma all the time, right? Whether it be a&nbsp;
plane crash or natural disaster or sexual assault&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:58.960
in adulthood. And then the other ingredient with&nbsp;
children is that their minds just seem to be more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:07.200
susceptible to this kind of splitting process.&nbsp;
The their child's mind tends to do that naturally.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.680
You're listening to 88.1. We'll be right back&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:16.960
with the second half of this interview&nbsp;
with Dr. Colin Ross right after this.

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:22.480
Are you familiar with Jennifer Fried's work with&nbsp;
her theory of betrayal trauma when it deals with&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:28.240
child abuse? Actually, the I wasn't going into&nbsp;
all of this here, but the main change in my&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:33.360
thinking in terms of how I work with these people&nbsp;
clinically over the last 3 years has been shifting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:39.040
much more towards a betrayal trauma type way of&nbsp;
looking at things. Mhm. That's not really directly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:45.440
related to mind control, but yeah, I like her&nbsp;
theory a lot and I agree with it. Right. Um, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:50.560
false memory people, Jennifer Fried, for listeners&nbsp;
who don't know, is the daughter of Pamela and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:55.760
Peter Fried. Pamela Fried's the executive director&nbsp;
of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation. And the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:00.560
False Memory Syndrome Foundation takes a point&nbsp;
of view that multiple personality is pretty bogus&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:05.920
and all these memories that people in therapy are&nbsp;
recovering are all false. And it's just a result&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:12.880
of basically of mind control techniques by bad&nbsp;
therapists. Um the the scientific advisory board&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:17.440
of the false memory syndrome foundation which is&nbsp;
a whole bunch of academics and experts who advise&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:24.000
the foundation and sort of speak on behalf&nbsp;
of it include Martin or Jolly West who had&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:32.400
top secret CIA clearance. uh Harold Leaf who is&nbsp;
the personal psychiatrist to the Friedes also uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:38.480
was a co-author of Robert Heath who did the brain&nbsp;
electrode research at Tain that was funded by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:46.880
various branches of the military and the CIA and&nbsp;
there's um about five of Martin Orin's co-authors&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:52.320
or people that he thanks in publications of&nbsp;
his uh going back into the 50s different mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:58.560
control research that he did who are also on&nbsp;
the board. Margaret Singer who interviewed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:03.760
these Korean prisoners of war who had top secret&nbsp;
clearance through the military to do that work&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:10.080
is also on the board. Um so there's a quite&nbsp;
an connection and overlap between these false&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:10.080 --> 01:30:14.720
memory syndrome foundation people not all of them&nbsp;
but a subgroup of them and all this military mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:20.000
control research. Have you had any experiences&nbsp;
with the false memory syndrome foundation? And I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:26.720
understand they have been fairly aggressive in uh&nbsp;
in intimidating uh therapists uh throughout North&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:31.520
America. Well, North America. Well, I've had&nbsp;
a fair bit of experience with the False Memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:37.040
Syndrome Foundation. I sub I belong to the False&nbsp;
Memory Syndrome Foundation. I get their newsletter&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:44.240
and I've um been talked about and have written&nbsp;
in their newsletter. I set up a workshop in uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:49.360
Houston where I spoke for a day and a half and&nbsp;
Pamela Fried the executive director spoke for half&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:56.240
a day and I've set up about five or six workshops&nbsp;
that I've done with Elizabeth Loftess who's a one&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:30:56.240 --> 01:31:04.080
of the leading members of the advisory board. Um I&nbsp;
get spoke at a meeting that Steven Cece was at. He&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:10.080
spoke after me and he commented very favorably on&nbsp;
my talk. He's on the advisory board. So, I've got&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:16.800
a lot of uh contacts with uh some of these people&nbsp;
which I consider to be very friendly. I admire&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:22.320
their work. Uh I disagree a little bit with some&nbsp;
of the things I think. But by and large, I agree&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:27.920
with probably over half of what the majority of&nbsp;
people on the false memory syndrome advisory board&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:33.920
say. And as I mentioned earlier, I've testified&nbsp;
in court basically much the same as any of those&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:39.280
people would. that here's an example of really bad&nbsp;
therapy that created multiple personality out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:45.280
nowhere and caused a lot of damage and harm to&nbsp;
the person and their family. In the false memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:50.160
syndrome sort of camp, not necessarily the&nbsp;
organization itself, but in the kind of camp,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:57.200
there are people who are just real extremists have&nbsp;
gone way overboard and they're very inflammatory&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:01.760
in the way they talk and everything's all black&nbsp;
and white and the whole multiple personality&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:06.720
field is supposed to be totally bad and all the&nbsp;
memories are completely false. And so there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:11.760
people in that camp who go way overboard. My&nbsp;
view on them is that if you take sort of set&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:18.560
aside some of the really political posturing and&nbsp;
the most kind of rabid politics that comes out and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:23.200
you just listen to kind of the basic message,&nbsp;
I agree with it. I think it's been incredibly&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:28.800
helpful to the field. Not just uh dissocive&nbsp;
disorders field or sexual trauma therapists,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:28.800 --> 01:32:35.600
but the entire mental health field really. In&nbsp;
the 1980s, there was almost zero teaching on how&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:42.480
errorprone memory is, almost no teaching at all&nbsp;
about how to think about it, what to do about it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:48.000
what guidelines we need. All these guidelines&nbsp;
about false memories and memory not being reliable&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:52.800
really have only come out of the professional&nbsp;
organization starting in '94. And the False Memory&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:57.760
Syndrome Foundation spearheaded that. So, a lot of&nbsp;
the work they've done has been incredibly helpful.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:32:57.760 --> 01:33:04.640
I agree with it. And it's simply a fact that&nbsp;
memory is very unreliable, right? It's just when&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:09.520
you things get really polarized and everybody's&nbsp;
really insulting everybody else and it's a big&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:15.520
war, then it becomes ridiculous. Well, and and it&nbsp;
seems that the survivors uh of abuse are are again&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:22.000
revictimized by by this type of argument where um&nbsp;
you know, the focus seems to be proving whether a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:29.520
memory was false or not instead of um actually um&nbsp;
finding out whether abuse did happen or not. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:33.440
it gets all politicized and everybody gets very&nbsp;
hot under the collar and very defensive about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:39.920
it. like in the in the false memory syndrome&nbsp;
foundation the in the membership I'm sure that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:44.800
there are a whole bunch of people who actually&nbsp;
are falsely accused but I'm sure there's also a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:48.720
whole bunch of people who are accurately accused&nbsp;
and are just trying to run a little scam and say&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:54.960
it's false memories right but that that needs to&nbsp;
be set aside if you're trying to look at sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:59.120
scientifically what are the issues about memory&nbsp;
and what's the best way to do therapy and how&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:04.720
do you have to kind of balance things to have&nbsp;
therapy that's hopefully more beneficial than&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:10.720
more harmful if people would get off all of the&nbsp;
ugly politics and have more of a sort of rational&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:16.320
calm scientific discussion. It' be much better.&nbsp;
And then uh you know then they wouldn't hear the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:19.920
therapist saying that the false memory people&nbsp;
are all just pedophiles and you wouldn't hear&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:25.600
the false memory people saying that the therapists&nbsp;
are all insane. Now in your opinion, how has the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:31.200
false memory debate affected therapy resources&nbsp;
available for survivors in in a general sense?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:38.800
Um well it's affected negatively basically because&nbsp;
the a lot of the therapists have got real paranoid&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:44.000
and there's a lot of agitation in um insurance&nbsp;
companies and the managed care companies in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.640
United States about this kind of therapy. Now the&nbsp;
idea that most of the memories are false really is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.920
just the basic standard position of psychiatry&nbsp;
through the whole 20th century. It's nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:59.440
new. How how do you feel that the debate has&nbsp;
affected how therapists deal with their clients?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.840
Well, I think it's been beneficial and harmful&nbsp;
at the same time. It's been beneficial because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:10.880
therapists have had to get their act together&nbsp;
a little bit and be more aware that memory is&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:16.800
extremely vague and unreliable and that you&nbsp;
can't take everything at face value. And then&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:21.840
I've written at great length about strategically&nbsp;
how to plan the therapy so that you do the same&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:26.880
thing no matter what percentage of the memory is&nbsp;
true or false. Most of the time you don't know for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:32.960
a fact. So, it's been very helpful in that way.&nbsp;
And then it's been harmful in that uh it's just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:38.400
given an excuse to all kinds of people who don't&nbsp;
want to deal with abuse anyway to say, "Oh, it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:43.680
all false memories." And it's made the therapist&nbsp;
defensive and it's taken a lot of time and energy&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:50.960
away from treatment on to worrying about whether&nbsp;
you're going to get sued or not. But you can't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:57.120
they're sort of opposite sides of the same coin.&nbsp;
You you can't have therapists finally getting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:35:57.120 --> 01:36:00.400
the message that they have to be more careful&nbsp;
without also having therapists who are more&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:06.960
paranoid about getting sued. U for the benefit&nbsp;
of other therapists that might be listening,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:13.200
is there um a way to recognize signs of possible&nbsp;
mind control experimentation? Are there signs that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:19.920
come up again and again in survivor accounts? Uh&nbsp;
you mean actual military or intelligence agency&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:27.120
mind control, right? Or because mind control&nbsp;
can be done informally and unwittingly by just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:34.000
the pedophile father at home or it can be done by&nbsp;
any one of the known destructive cults or it can&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.720
be done as part of a military research program.&nbsp;
So it depends which level you're talking about.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:45.120
I'm speaking yeah specifically of the government&nbsp;
uh funded experiments. No, there's no kind of uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:50.720
you know if the person comes in with a sore left&nbsp;
elbow that's a sure sign. There's no kind of sign&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:56.240
or symptom like that that's going to automatically&nbsp;
clue you off, but there's probably going to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:02.160
some sort of dissociative disorder. And it's it's&nbsp;
not so much that you go after it as the person&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:09.440
starts giving you memories of, you know, it wasn't&nbsp;
some stereotype satanic thing out in the woods.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:14.800
They start actually telling you uh something&nbsp;
that sounds like medical research of some kind,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.560
experiments of some kind. It's either at a&nbsp;
university, it's in a hospital, it's on a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:28.000
military base. So, I don't think it really is a&nbsp;
bad plan to specifically start asking questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:33.200
You have to just wait and for the person to start&nbsp;
describing that kind of stuff. And then if they&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:38.800
start describing that kind of stuff, you just&nbsp;
follow normal kind of therapy procedures where&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.880
you just say, "Could you tell me a little bit&nbsp;
more about that?" or I don't quite understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:47.280
this or could you clarify that or what does that&nbsp;
mean to you? Why is that important to you? How&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:52.320
is that affecting you now? How does that tie into&nbsp;
the problems that we're working on now? Mhm. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:58.080
you really just handle it using basic sensible&nbsp;
therapy techniques that you wouldn't there's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:05.280
not a special set of strategies or techniques for&nbsp;
mind control as such. And these people basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:11.120
are human beings who have who've been hurt and&nbsp;
have problems and you need to use same basic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:19.280
methods of therapy you would otherwise. So like&nbsp;
if my personal conclusion is that probably the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:24.240
majority not almost for sure the vast majority of&nbsp;
the satanic ritual abuse memories that I've heard&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:24.240 --> 01:38:29.440
which involves like hundreds and hundreds and&nbsp;
hundreds and hundreds of babies being sacrificed&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:35.200
vast majority of that can't actually be real. Some&nbsp;
of it could be, but the techniques that I use and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:39.920
the strategies use in therapy for people who have&nbsp;
those satanic ritual abuse memories are really&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:44.800
pretty much identical to the same strategies for&nbsp;
somebody who doesn't have those kind of memories.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:50.880
And the same applies to the military mind control&nbsp;
people. The way I go at it, I use the same basic&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:55.920
strategies, principles, and techniques. I don't&nbsp;
really focus on the memories as the main problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:38:55.920 --> 01:39:05.280
Mhm. In in your um opinion, do you think there is&nbsp;
any links between um the accounts of ritual abuse&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:12.320
and mind control experimentation? Uh nothing&nbsp;
documented. The only the link is in the mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:19.680
control experts. The people who are contractors&nbsp;
for the CI and the military who understand the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:25.040
mind control techniques. Therefore, the military&nbsp;
wants to tap into their expertise are also tend&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:30.400
to people be people who are experts on mind&nbsp;
control techniques of destructive cults. But&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:36.000
a direct connection between cults and the&nbsp;
military. The only uh book I know about&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.560
that is a book called was Jonestown a CIA medical&nbsp;
experiment written by a man named Michael Meyers,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:49.440
right? Published by the Edwin Melon Press. and he&nbsp;
pres presents a lot of pretty solid documentation&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:54.400
that's not quite 100% conclusive that the CIA was&nbsp;
heavily involved in Jonestown. Right. You've gone&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:59.520
into a fair bit of detail in that in your your&nbsp;
lecture that we've previously well one couple of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:06.240
just to give a little smattering of the kind of&nbsp;
things. One example is that the people's temple&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:11.440
which was run by Jim Stone Jim Jones was based in&nbsp;
Yukaya, California which is north of San Francisco&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:16.720
and then they moved down to the jungle in British&nbsp;
Gana. And before I read this book, I never really&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:23.120
thought about how did they go about choosing that&nbsp;
site. M well it turns out that that site in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:28.640
middle of the jungle in British Gana immediately&nbsp;
before Jim Jones moved down there it was the site&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:37.280
of the CIA shalom project which was a program for&nbsp;
uh black exgring Bray u military people to train&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:42.640
mercenaries for Angola and then there's a whole&nbsp;
which obviously couldn't just be coincidence and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:48.000
then there's just a wealth of other detail&nbsp;
like that connecting all kinds of things in

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:56.960
Who in your sense who who do you think&nbsp;
is behind all of this? Like the Well,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:01.760
I think I'm sort of not really that much&nbsp;
of a conspiracy theorist. I just think&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:07.600
that it boils down to typical normal stuff&nbsp;
that controls the rest of the world. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:14.720
it's got to do with military and the government&nbsp;
and banks and helicopter sales and spying. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:23.680
it's it's no different from, you know, who runs&nbsp;
radar or who runs jets or who runs anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:31.280
It's a lot of it's just military contracting&nbsp;
and it's government and it's a big business and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:37.840
Mhm. I don't I don't I'm not I don't personally&nbsp;
subscribe to a special conspiracy theory like and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:42.480
I don't think there's anyone at least the evidence&nbsp;
I see I don't think there's any one little group&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:47.760
of people who meet in some room you know somewhere&nbsp;
at the Pentagon who are pulling all the strings on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:53.040
all this. I think it's much like the federal&nbsp;
government. It's all kinds of little groups&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:41:53.040 --> 01:42:00.640
working at cross purposes and there's no one grand&nbsp;
master design of any kind. Right. It's a network&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:07.200
uh the old boys network. Uh yeah, old boys network&nbsp;
is the way I describe it. And that's one reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:13.120
I think of that is there doesn't have to be some&nbsp;
kind of huge obviously there is a conspiracy in a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:17.440
sense and that it there's secret funding of mind&nbsp;
control research and there's files and it's kept&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:24.000
from the public. But in terms of the stuff that&nbsp;
actually documented, there didn't have to be that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:28.160
huge a conspiracy because they just went ahead and&nbsp;
published it in the medical literature anyway. The&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:35.360
conspiracy is really the sort of old boys network.&nbsp;
Everybody just looks the other way and knows that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:40.080
they're not supposed to comment on it kind of&nbsp;
conspiracy. Mhm. It's not that anybody has to,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:45.040
you know, send out a memo to every psychiatrist in&nbsp;
North America saying keep this secret. Everybody&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:45.040 --> 01:42:53.280
just kind of looks the other way, steers around&nbsp;
it, doesn't rock the boat, doesn't make waves.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:42:53.280 --> 01:43:01.360
I've just got a couple more questions. Um I'm&nbsp;
wondering uh how how a person undergoes the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:09.200
healing process that that have been um traumatized&nbsp;
as a child or having participated um in the mind&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:16.000
control experimentation. What what is the process&nbsp;
for healing? Uh well some some people are probably&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:23.680
too damaged to be able to heal. U so nobody&nbsp;
should claim that they know how to help everybody.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:29.600
um or some people are damaged and they have the&nbsp;
ability to heal, but I just not going to be able&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.360
to describe how that should be done. So, they&nbsp;
need to go to somebody else. But the people that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:40.800
we work with, m multiple personality, who I'll&nbsp;
describe really traumatic childhoods. Um we don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:44.880
really, like I mentioned just a few minutes ago,&nbsp;
we don't really focus on the memories as such.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:49.680
Mhm. What we deal with is how these different&nbsp;
personalities working together as a sort of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:55.040
inner family are getting along with each other and&nbsp;
mostly not getting along with each other. And we&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:43:55.040 --> 01:44:00.640
try and get them to have more open communication&nbsp;
and cooperation with each other, have more of a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:05.840
problem solving, strategizing kind of approach to&nbsp;
life instead of all this conflict and fighting and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:14.240
amnesia. And then uh we work on building up more&nbsp;
healthy, more flexible ways of coping with life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:20.320
And that's just in a nutshell to describe in&nbsp;
detail is that's why my book is 400 pages long,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:26.160
right? Takes quite a while. Um, and you you had&nbsp;
mentioned that um a lot of in in in a particular&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:31.680
test that you've done um a lot were able to&nbsp;
integrate um these personalities back into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:31.680 --> 01:44:37.280
a kind of a hole. Is that is that really the goal&nbsp;
of of the healing process or Well, it's the it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:41.920
the goal in one sense to be this is we're just&nbsp;
talking about people with multiple personality.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:46.400
vast majority of people who are involved in mind&nbsp;
control experiments and the vast majority of&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:50.480
people who are abused as children don't have&nbsp;
multiple personality. I so I just specialize&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:58.480
in that little subgroup which is only little you&nbsp;
know small island in this whole sea of trauma but&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:04.560
um the reason integration is the goal for them&nbsp;
is basically that it's it's normal and desirable&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:14.000
to be sort of an integrated human being and if&nbsp;
you have a reasonably healthy happy childhood&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.160
and adolescence and you have a reasonably&nbsp;
healthy happy normal adulthood you're going&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:22.080
to be integrated you're not going to have&nbsp;
multiple personality. But the other reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:28.000
is because it just works better. It's not that&nbsp;
integration is the big goal in and of itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:35.840
It's just that integration is a way to get&nbsp;
to the goal of far far far far less symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:41.280
uh much more happy settled state internally,&nbsp;
much better quality of personal relationships,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:46.800
much better functioning in the workplace and&nbsp;
huge reduction in the amount of health care and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:53.280
mental health care resources you need. Now, you&nbsp;
mentioned that you are uh about to release a book&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:57.920
um about mind control. What what specifically&nbsp;
will the book deal with and and when will it&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:03.840
uh do you expect it to be published? I'm just um&nbsp;
I'm working just finished the second draft of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:09.200
third draft of the book. So, it's been through&nbsp;
three complete changes and now the final one&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:14.560
I've done a pretty extensive rewrite of it and&nbsp;
I've got a little bit more information. I'm just&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:20.640
uh sort of digesting and waiting to come in&nbsp;
from one of the universities that I got some&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:25.680
information from. Um and then I'll probably go&nbsp;
over it one more time kind of stylistically and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:29.760
then we'll see if we can get a publisher to bite&nbsp;
on it. So, I'm hoping that it'll be out before&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:35.440
the end of 97. And and what specifically are you&nbsp;
are you dealing with in the book? Um, basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:40.400
everything that we've been talking about, the main&nbsp;
points are going to be that the US military and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:46.240
the CIA have been creating experimental multiple&nbsp;
personality and that's an established fact because&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:51.280
of the documentation. The extent that those people&nbsp;
were used in operations is still not really fully&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:58.880
known. uh the fact that you can create artificial&nbsp;
multiple personality to me proves both that like I&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:03.280
said earlier that it can be created artificially&nbsp;
and also that it's likely to arise spontaneously&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:11.440
and I go into that in a bunch of detail and then&nbsp;
all this other crazy mind control research I use&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:17.680
that to set the context to make it believable that&nbsp;
multiple personality could been created by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:21.760
military cuz if you just hear that out of nowhere&nbsp;
it just seems too much to believe but when you&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:29.120
have that whole context then you realize really&nbsp;
just fits in nicely. And then the other part is to&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:33.440
try and stimulate either a presidential commission&nbsp;
or some sort of public inquiry into this and get&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:38.720
the medical ethics of it really tightened up&nbsp;
and make sure that this stuff is not ongoing,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:38.720 --> 01:47:44.720
right? And get some recognition and compensation&nbsp;
for the victims. That's basically the gist of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:51.440
book. Do you have evidence of experimental brain&nbsp;
implant surgery being done on epilepsy patients?&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:52.480 --> 01:47:58.320
Uh well there's two answers to that question.&nbsp;
One is that all this documented brain electrode&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:05.680
implant research that I described some of those&nbsp;
patients actually had epilepsy and a whole bunch&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:11.520
of them epilepsy was kind of a phony rationale&nbsp;
for putting electrodes in. So when you read that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:16.720
literature a lot of the time they'll describe the&nbsp;
patient as having epilepsy and then other times&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:22.880
they uh actually put brain electrodes in just for&nbsp;
either psychiatric reasons which were basically&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:29.840
bogus reasons or purely experimental reasons&nbsp;
but epilepsy is one of the rationale for putting&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:35.200
brain electrodes in that's totally documented.&nbsp;
And would these uh people be informed of that&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:42.640
they were to receive brain implants or uh yeah&nbsp;
but uh the sort of explanation for why that was&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:50.320
scientifically justified and the informed consent&nbsp;
procedure was really iffy. Yeah. And and what uh&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:57.520
what literature is available uh on this subject?&nbsp;
Uh there's a book called Violence in the Brain by&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:05.840
uh Mark and published if I remember the year&nbsp;
like 1970 or 72. it's a little bit hard to get&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:11.760
or if you go into part of the problem is you&nbsp;
can't do computerized searches of the medical&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:21.760
literature before 1966. But if you go to the&nbsp;
medical literature in the period 1955 to 1970&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:30.240
and you look for publications by Robert Heath&nbsp;
at Tlane University or Jose Delgado at Yale,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:36.240
you'll find those scattered around in the&nbsp;
medical literature. Okay? Or you just do&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:42.560
literature searches on brain electrode implants.&nbsp;
Or then there's a huge literature on LSD.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:47.920
It's just a matter of really going to the&nbsp;
library and and searching around or in the&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:54.320
book like I'll reference a lot of it. Well, I'd&nbsp;
like to thank you very much, Dr. Colin Ross,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:58.560
for joining us on CKLN. It's been very&nbsp;
illuminating talking to you and I I wish&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:06.800
you all the best with your your new book. Yeah,&nbsp;
my pleasure. Thanks for doing a series on this.

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:09.280
We've been listening to an&nbsp;
interview with Dr. Dr. Colin Ross,&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:13.760
a Canadian psychiatrist working with&nbsp;
dissociative identity disorder and&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:20.720
has also documented the CIA military&nbsp;
mind control experimental programs.

01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:27.200
Transcripts are available of the lecture that&nbsp;
started off this series at the office of CKLN for&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:34.000
$2. And the transcripts of this interview will&nbsp;
be available in 2 to 3 weeks time at CKLN.&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:38.560
We'll be back next week with more in the&nbsp;
mind control in Canada radio series on&nbsp;&nbsp;

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:41.760
the international connection here on 88.1 Calen.
