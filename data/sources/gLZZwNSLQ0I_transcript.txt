Kind: captions Language: en What's up you guys? Welcome to the imagination.&nbsp; I'm your host, Emma, and today I'm honored to have&nbsp;&nbsp; back on the show once again, podcast regular,&nbsp; United Church minister, turned whistleblower,&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadian hero, humanitarian, loving father,&nbsp; published writer and author, public speaker&nbsp;&nbsp; and podcaster, documentary filmmaker, Nobel Peace&nbsp; Prize nominee, co-founder of the international&nbsp;&nbsp; tribunal into crimes of church and state,&nbsp; righteous soul, and eagle strong voice,&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin Annet. In case you've missed any of Kevin's&nbsp; past episodes or our movie night feature where we&nbsp;&nbsp; aired his acclaimed documentary, Unrepentant&nbsp; on this channel, here's a brief intro into his&nbsp;&nbsp; testimony and background along with some helpful&nbsp; information on what we'll be talking about today.&nbsp;&nbsp; Kevin's early life was shaped by compassion and&nbsp; a call to serve as a United Church minister in&nbsp;&nbsp; Port Alurnie, British Columbia in the early&nbsp; 1990s. their indigenous survivors of Canada's&nbsp;&nbsp; residential schools revealed a hidden genocide,&nbsp; abuse, forced sterilizations, and child deaths&nbsp;&nbsp; orchestrated by church and state. Kevin's refusal&nbsp; to stay silent led to his 1997 defrocking, a&nbsp;&nbsp; historic first for political reasons. Undeterred,&nbsp; he documented survivors stories and produced the&nbsp;&nbsp; 2006 documentary Unrepentant, which exposed these&nbsp; atrocities and helped prompt Canada's 2008 apology&nbsp;&nbsp; to indigenous survivors. His investigations&nbsp; reached global elites, including the Vatican,&nbsp;&nbsp; leading him to co-found the International Tribunal&nbsp; into Crimes of Church and State in 2010. His work&nbsp;&nbsp; with the International Common Law Court of Justice&nbsp; contributed to Pope Benedict's 2013 resignation,&nbsp;&nbsp; a historic event linked to allegations of&nbsp; church crime. Despite facing smear campaigns,&nbsp;&nbsp; death threats, and blacklisting, Kevin has&nbsp; earned Nobel Peace Prize nominations for his&nbsp;&nbsp; relentless pursuit of justice. Through his radio&nbsp; program, Here We Stand, in the Republic of Canada,&nbsp;&nbsp; a movement for self-governance under common law,&nbsp; Kevin has inspired thousands to reject centralized&nbsp;&nbsp; power. His tireless advocacy from indigenous&nbsp; communities to international tribunals amplifies&nbsp;&nbsp; the marginalized and challenges the powerful. Now&nbsp; in books he's written like Truthteller Shield,&nbsp;&nbsp; a manual for whistleblowers and Hellraisers,&nbsp; the theory and practice of letting your truth&nbsp;&nbsp; and the truth prevail, which is a powerful manual&nbsp; for empowering whistleblowers and truth tellers,&nbsp;&nbsp; and another book, Governing Ourselves, a handbook&nbsp; on personal, political, and spiritual sovereignty,&nbsp;&nbsp; which we will be discussing and referring to&nbsp; today. Kevin distills his decades of struggle&nbsp;&nbsp; into a powerful guide for liberation. Co-authored&nbsp; with indigenous elders, legal scholars, and global&nbsp;&nbsp; activists, the book is both a manifesto&nbsp; and a practical blueprint. It argues that&nbsp;&nbsp; true freedom begins with reclaiming personal&nbsp; agency, rejecting corporate and state control,&nbsp;&nbsp; and embracing spiritual awakening. Drawing on the&nbsp; Republic of Canada's experiments with common law&nbsp;&nbsp; courts and citizens assemblies, this book offers&nbsp; tools for building self-governing communities&nbsp;&nbsp; rooted in equality and mutual accountability. It&nbsp; is a call to action, urging readers to embody the&nbsp;&nbsp; principle that we are beholden to none, save one&nbsp; another, and the laws we establish. Kevin's life&nbsp;&nbsp; is a testament to the power of one individual&nbsp; to ignite change. From a small church in Port Al&nbsp;&nbsp; Bernie to a global stage, he has exposed truths&nbsp; that shook empires and inspired a movement for&nbsp;&nbsp; sovereignty. As Kevin continues to lead by&nbsp; example, his story reminds us that courage,&nbsp;&nbsp; truth, and solidarity can dismantle even the&nbsp; most entrenched systems of oppression. In a world&nbsp;&nbsp; hungry for freedom, Kevin stands as a beacon,&nbsp; showing us how to govern ourselves and build a&nbsp;&nbsp; future worthy of our highest aspirations.

The one,&nbsp;&nbsp; the only Kevin Annit. Kevin, thank you so much for&nbsp; being here with us again today. It's always such&nbsp;&nbsp; an honor to have you on. Oh, it's always a joy to&nbsp; be back. Thank you, Emma. You're so welcome. I'm&nbsp;&nbsp; excited for for today's topic and you know, we've&nbsp; had some really great podcast episodes. The thing&nbsp;&nbsp; I was telling you before we started recording&nbsp; that I really love about working with you is&nbsp;&nbsp; you're so knowledgeable about so much. So, there's&nbsp; so much that we can talk about whether it's as a&nbsp;&nbsp; big picture or sort of a focused detail. And so,&nbsp; today I'm really excited for this conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I think it's really going to help people&nbsp; feel empowered to take their sovereignty into&nbsp;&nbsp; their own hands and to sort of have a direction on&nbsp; how to do that. So I thought maybe we could start&nbsp;&nbsp; um you're actually working with some groups right&nbsp; now helping produce and manifest in real life&nbsp;&nbsp; this exact topic that we're talking about today&nbsp; personal and um sovereignty throughout a nation&nbsp;&nbsp; or throughout a community. And so I thought I&nbsp; would give you an opportunity to share a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit about that because it's really revolutionary&nbsp; what you're doing. Well, in what other more and&nbsp;&nbsp; more people are doing um in two places in America&nbsp; and England this last month there's been a real&nbsp;&nbsp; coalescing of people who some of whom we inspired&nbsp; but other people have just come forward. It's kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of like this hundth monkey phenomenon. People have&nbsp; just come from everywhere all of a sudden and I&nbsp;&nbsp; mean that is reflected in the fact that we sold&nbsp; over 1,200 of my books in the last two months.&nbsp;&nbsp; normally in the same period of time would sell&nbsp; maybe 50 or 100. So it's going through the roof&nbsp;&nbsp; now this interest and yeah you you mentioned this&nbsp; book and they both both in America and England&nbsp;&nbsp; these new groups are relying heavily on this. I'll&nbsp; tell you about them. First of all, uh in England&nbsp;&nbsp; for a number of years, people have been trying to&nbsp; they've shown kind of a passive interest in what&nbsp;&nbsp; we're doing in Canada because we're facing the&nbsp; same uh institution of the crown, right? And this&nbsp;&nbsp; last month, a organizing committee has formed&nbsp; to establish a republic, sovereign republic in&nbsp;&nbsp; England called the Republic of Albon. Albio N.&nbsp; And uh that's a traditional Gaelic word. It kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of embraces a lot of the culture there and um it&nbsp; also reflects the fact that historically there&nbsp;&nbsp; was a republic in England. It's in under Cromwell&nbsp; and the Puritans when they cut off the c the head&nbsp;&nbsp; of the king Charles um in 1649 for 11 years they&nbsp; had a republic. Parliament abolished the monarchy&nbsp;&nbsp; and the house of lords and said it was a crime of&nbsp; treason to reestablish the British monarchy. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, Charles II comes along, does a military coup,&nbsp; overthrows the republic, and reestablishes the&nbsp;&nbsp; monarchy, but it was never a dour or lawful power.&nbsp; It was kind of a de facto coup, but it it's never&nbsp;&nbsp; had, in other words, the British crown has not&nbsp; had lawful authority since 1649. It's a power,&nbsp;&nbsp; but not a lawful one. And that really helped us&nbsp; when we set up the Republican Kennetic as we said,&nbsp;&nbsp; look, it's always been a fiction, literally&nbsp; the authority of the crown. Well, the folks&nbsp;&nbsp; in England, they've now reached a critical mass&nbsp; and they now have organizing committees in four&nbsp;&nbsp; different areas in Ireland because there is&nbsp; kind of a cultural and historical affinity&nbsp;&nbsp; in the north of Ireland, um Scotland, Wales, and&nbsp; England. Okay? And they they have a flag uh which&nbsp;&nbsp; they're just uh I'll send it to you later. You can&nbsp; post it. We uh they're just in the process of kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of finalizing it, but it'll have the symbols&nbsp; of those four cultures on it. and um uh they&nbsp;&nbsp; have agreed to very much follow the setting kind&nbsp; of the outline we did in Canada which is they've&nbsp;&nbsp; uh decided on a constitution they're going to go&nbsp; public and say look this is not just replacing a&nbsp;&nbsp; figurehead uh knocking out a king and putting&nbsp; in a president right this is an transformation&nbsp;&nbsp; from the grassroots so they're they'll be setting&nbsp; up as we did uh local republic assemblies courts&nbsp;&nbsp; um their own sheriffs to enforce it, making&nbsp; the appeal to people to switch allegiance,&nbsp;&nbsp; nullify their oath of allegiance to Charles&nbsp; and the crown and take it to constitution. So&nbsp;&nbsp; reviving the republic, that's in their tradition.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, it was interesting because&nbsp;&nbsp; after the republic got overthrown, a lot of those&nbsp; folks came to came to America to New England.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um it was interesting early on people know the&nbsp; story of the Mayflower landing at Plymouth Rock&nbsp;&nbsp; in 1620. 50 years following that uh there were um&nbsp; people who used to be in the new model army who&nbsp;&nbsp; fought with Cromwell who had come over refugees&nbsp; from England and these folks wrote out the early&nbsp;&nbsp; statements in Connecticut and Plymouth of what&nbsp; their republic should look like. that is they&nbsp;&nbsp; formed the first covenant the first real identity&nbsp; the new identity people had that we are Americans&nbsp;&nbsp; because we are governing ourselves we're not&nbsp; beholden to any ruler any monarch you know&nbsp;&nbsp; um and so there was that continuity you know from&nbsp; England to America and the same thing's happening&nbsp;&nbsp; now because part two of this is in America there&nbsp; is uh now we're in touch with people in uh 14&nbsp;&nbsp; different states who are interested in this and&nbsp; what they're doing is they want to issue a new&nbsp;&nbsp; Declaration of Independence against the existing&nbsp; system and they've they've united Democrats and&nbsp;&nbsp; Republicans because they've lost the old labels.&nbsp; These are Americans who are saying one of the the&nbsp;&nbsp; people had at one of these meetings I took part&nbsp; in on a Zoom call. They had a big flag on the&nbsp;&nbsp; wall that said neither Republican nor Democrat but&nbsp; American going back to the roots of who we all are&nbsp;&nbsp; and making that that unity again. And people are&nbsp; so hungering for that, right? and um you know this&nbsp;&nbsp; divisive conflict that's been going on. people now&nbsp; in America are saying we need a new declaration to&nbsp;&nbsp; remind us of what to recover our soul to remind&nbsp; us at the heart of America is the fact that not&nbsp;&nbsp; only are all people created equal but they remain&nbsp; equal and they've got to establish their own way&nbsp;&nbsp; to govern themselves in in the law in politics in&nbsp; everything so that all the citizens are involved&nbsp;&nbsp; that you know for example there should be no laws&nbsp; passed in which we haven't had a say the best laws&nbsp;&nbsp; come out of our own communities where people get&nbsp; together and say what do we want how do we want&nbsp;&nbsp; our communities to be and work that away from the&nbsp; grassroots. So it's really exciting. They want to&nbsp;&nbsp; issue this. They haven't set a date but they're&nbsp; they're holding like what happened in 1770s. U&nbsp;&nbsp; they're holding constitutional conventions all&nbsp; over and they're making an appeal to people to&nbsp;&nbsp; come out from these labels of Republican Democrat.&nbsp; Forget about the politicians no matter who they&nbsp;&nbsp; are. This is not an attack on anyone. It's an&nbsp; a reminder of America is a lot more than its&nbsp;&nbsp; politicians or its government. It's in the heart&nbsp; and soul of the people and we're trying to recover&nbsp;&nbsp; that soul. So it was beautiful. I was had tears&nbsp; in my eyes after talking to these folks because&nbsp;&nbsp; it's like you know finally it's happening where&nbsp; it should because I still believe that America&nbsp;&nbsp; and what it embodies is the hope of the world in&nbsp; the sense that you know the common law republic&nbsp;&nbsp; was a fact here. It wasn't just an nice nice idea.&nbsp; It's it's it keeps rising up through slavery and&nbsp;&nbsp; through all of these wrong turns that the country&nbsp; took. There's this this kind of gyroscope that&nbsp;&nbsp; keeps bringing us back on course all the time,&nbsp; right? It and and and that's a sign that the whole&nbsp;&nbsp; world needs in this age of the corportocracy.&nbsp; It's either a republic or this corporate monolith&nbsp;&nbsp; that's at the heart of all of these problems and&nbsp; crimes we've been talking about. So, those are two&nbsp;&nbsp; really exciting developments. And um of course,&nbsp; they want me to come over to England in the fall&nbsp;&nbsp; and I'll be down in the States as well helping&nbsp; with all this. But, oh my gosh, it's really great.&nbsp;&nbsp; me. I love that people are finding your work and&nbsp; starting to learn about these things. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't believe that this stuff isn't common&nbsp; knowledge to people living in society. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; people are just now finding out about this decades&nbsp; into their life and saying, "Oh, wait. I don't&nbsp;&nbsp; have to accept what's always been there. I can&nbsp; use my voice and get a group of people together&nbsp;&nbsp; and make a change." And I really love that you're&nbsp; being brought in on behalf of um these different&nbsp;&nbsp; movements especially that have to do with politics&nbsp; because unfortunately you know politics I think&nbsp;&nbsp; was rooted in maybe doing something good and&nbsp; creating law and order. However, throughout time&nbsp;&nbsp; and and especially now, the only purpose it really&nbsp; serves is to get people to hate one another. And&nbsp;&nbsp; it creates these little pockets of division and&nbsp; really compartmentalizes people from their own&nbsp;&nbsp; communities, you know, and then they get so caught&nbsp; up in idolizing these people that don't know them,&nbsp;&nbsp; that don't give a crap about them, you know, and&nbsp; and ultimately we're destroying ourselves from&nbsp;&nbsp; the inside out because these policies have been&nbsp; so inverted to work against us, you know. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; I really love that you're seeing people sick of&nbsp; that and saying, "What are we doing?" You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; let's all unite together in our own communities&nbsp; and and as a nation and throw out these different&nbsp;&nbsp; divisive tactics. We're better together. And&nbsp; that really says a lot about your work and the&nbsp;&nbsp; way that you've presented it that way. Right. And&nbsp; that's, you know, the power of this book and and&nbsp;&nbsp; the folks in America and England both said the&nbsp; same thing about this even though they hadn't&nbsp;&nbsp; been in communication. They're all just observing&nbsp; this that the power of this it combines all three&nbsp;&nbsp; personal political spiritual and I go into detail&nbsp; of what that looks like and not just me there was&nbsp;&nbsp; this was actually co-written with five other&nbsp; people people in our republic movement in in&nbsp;&nbsp; also from other countries uh you know like&nbsp; Tom House he's a traditional Ojiway elder&nbsp;&nbsp; who I've known for many years who is sits on&nbsp; the national council of the republic in Canada&nbsp;&nbsp; um and so when you said politics the you know&nbsp; in here We explain that the word comes from the&nbsp;&nbsp; Greek word polus p o l i s and all that meant in&nbsp; in the Greek language was the city because they&nbsp;&nbsp; were referring to Athens which was the first place&nbsp; in the world that people practice participatory&nbsp;&nbsp; democracy not representative where you sign your&nbsp; authority away to one guy and he does whatever&nbsp;&nbsp; he wants and you only have a say you know at the&nbsp; next election. Somebody did a funny cartoon. It&nbsp;&nbsp; shows a guy in a holding up a piece of paper paper&nbsp; and there's 10 X's on it and he says here's your&nbsp;&nbsp; lifetime ration of democracy, right? 10 crosses&nbsp; every time you vote. And Jeanjac Rouso in the&nbsp;&nbsp; social contract in the 1700s he wrote that he said&nbsp; in the English system of representative democracy&nbsp;&nbsp; you only have a moment of freedom when you choose&nbsp; somebody but then you lose freedom again because&nbsp;&nbsp; they are representing you right that's not&nbsp; the Athenian model. 500 years before Christ,&nbsp;&nbsp; they had a model in ancient Athens which&nbsp; was better than what we brought now. And&nbsp;&nbsp; first of all, every citizen was expected to&nbsp; participate. So they had big assemblies and&nbsp;&nbsp; um now of course citizen meant the non-slaves&nbsp; and women of course weren't included. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; so there's that. But in terms of their world,&nbsp; all of the males had the right and and duty,&nbsp;&nbsp; not just the right, but the obligation to attend&nbsp; these big assemblies where they were pass laws and&nbsp;&nbsp; they would all take turns in being the archon,&nbsp; which was like the the lawmaker. Um, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and to enforce the laws and to sit in the courts&nbsp; and everything. So, you draw lots and say, "Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; Emma's the judge this month." Okay. No, you&nbsp; got to take that responsibility. That way,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's always shared. It's equalized, right? the&nbsp; responsibility and the power. And not only that,&nbsp;&nbsp; but we get the word ostracize, okay, from this&nbsp; Greek word ostrachon. And that was a little piece&nbsp;&nbsp; of pottery. And whenever they didn't like somebody&nbsp; who was in power, they'd write his name on the&nbsp;&nbsp; ostrachon and vote him out. He'd be ostracized. He&nbsp; would be removed from office. He was accountable&nbsp;&nbsp; at all times. So it was kind of like a contract.&nbsp; You have a contract with somebody. You say, "Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll do this if you do this." But if either side&nbsp; violates a contract, boom, you can walk. It's null&nbsp;&nbsp; on board right away. That's the way government&nbsp; should be. You know, um if if people have voted&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody to we don't use the word representative&nbsp; in the Republic of Canada. We we say delegate&nbsp;&nbsp; because they're delegated to do a job by the&nbsp; people. If they don't do the job, the people go,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're out. Because the power resides, like any&nbsp; American who reads their constitutions knows,&nbsp;&nbsp; the power resides in the people. There isn't a&nbsp; government separate from the will of the people.&nbsp;&nbsp; People combine and create a government and they&nbsp; can remove it at any time. That's the simple idea&nbsp;&nbsp; that that we're reviving in in people that that&nbsp; memory, right? Um and so we go into the detail&nbsp;&nbsp; first about the political and um there there's you&nbsp; know the personal spiritual is is other aspects we&nbsp;&nbsp; can talk about as well. Absolutely. I wanted you&nbsp; to I would love for people to purchase this book.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um, one thing I really love about your books,&nbsp; and I mentioned this to you before we came on,&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't write books leading people to different&nbsp; cliffhers of keep buying, keep buying, depend on&nbsp;&nbsp; me to give you, you know, to lead you to where you&nbsp; need to be. You write the literal blueprints of&nbsp;&nbsp; how somebody can empower themselves 100% and not&nbsp; need anybody to do so in your books. And I think&nbsp;&nbsp; this one is a really great example of about that.&nbsp; And I wanted you to just maybe share anything else&nbsp;&nbsp; that you wanted people to know about it because&nbsp; I think this is a really important one especially&nbsp;&nbsp; because you do cover the personal, political, and&nbsp; spiritual aspects of our sovereignty. And this is&nbsp;&nbsp; on Amazon for people listening. Um you can get it&nbsp; from Kevin's website, too. It'll take you right to&nbsp;&nbsp; the Amazon page. Um I'll link both and and we'll&nbsp; have a couple other book recommendations too on&nbsp;&nbsp; these topics for you guys. Right. So the uh we&nbsp; start in the book with the political because&nbsp;&nbsp; that kind of affects everybody. But part two is&nbsp; spiritual sovereignty. And the example I use to&nbsp;&nbsp; best understand this because everyone it's kind&nbsp; of a funny term. I make a distinction in the book&nbsp;&nbsp; between religion and spirituality. And I say well&nbsp; religion is kind of like comparing religion and&nbsp;&nbsp; spirituality is if if uh spirit which is from&nbsp; the Greek word numa breath right it's inherent&nbsp;&nbsp; in all of us. But religion is kind of like the&nbsp; weather report describing the wind, right? It&nbsp;&nbsp; it's describing something all the time. And and&nbsp; it comes from the a word in Latin meaning to tie&nbsp;&nbsp; people together religion. So it's it's this kind&nbsp; of a natural bringing everyone together in one&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of group. I mean that's like a a how empires&nbsp; operate, right? But spirit is inherent within all&nbsp;&nbsp; of us like our rights, like you know the common&nbsp; law, all of that. And by analogy in America,&nbsp;&nbsp; the way it happened was remember I mentioned&nbsp; the folks who came over from England as kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; refugees when the monarchy was reestablished. They&nbsp; were instrumental in in um the first principle was&nbsp;&nbsp; in our because we were seeking their independence&nbsp; as a spiritual communities, right? Uh the Puritans&nbsp;&nbsp; and others, they didn't want a king or a pope.&nbsp; They they believed in Christ as the head of&nbsp;&nbsp; the church. And to practice that they set up&nbsp; their own self-governing congregations where&nbsp;&nbsp; they would elect their own minister, right? And&nbsp; like Baptists today in America, they do the same&nbsp;&nbsp; thing. You can as a you see this all the time.&nbsp; You don't need a theological education. There's&nbsp;&nbsp; no church hierarchy. Every congregation, every&nbsp; community governs themselves and they elect their&nbsp;&nbsp; own minister, right? Um that was the model among&nbsp; the Puritans in the 1600s when they're up there in&nbsp;&nbsp; New England. Well, naturally the political system&nbsp; evolved out of that because in their town meetings&nbsp;&nbsp; and everything, they said, "Well, we're we govern&nbsp; ourselves spiritually. Why wouldn't we politically&nbsp;&nbsp; as well?" So, when you have that sense that we're&nbsp; all endowed by the creator with the same nature,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? We're all part of that oneness, why would&nbsp; we have a hierarchy? We don't have a hierarchy&nbsp;&nbsp; spiritually. Why would we have one politically&nbsp; and invest all power in a few people like who can,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, pass laws without a permission, write&nbsp; executive orders, and everybody has to go along&nbsp;&nbsp; with it? That's got nothing to do with true&nbsp; self-governance and what America's all about. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it it evolved naturally from the spiritual&nbsp; sovereign into the political. And uh the the&nbsp;&nbsp; personal is a a harder one in a way to deal with.&nbsp; Um, let me we'll get into that, but let me just&nbsp;&nbsp; if you have any comments or questions about any of&nbsp; that. Yeah, I would love to get more into it. And&nbsp;&nbsp; before we do, um, I wanted to bring up a couple&nbsp; other book recommendations that we were going to&nbsp;&nbsp; share real quick. Um, just on these topics,&nbsp; um, because again, I think I think your work&nbsp;&nbsp; is really important and it's so affordable. It's&nbsp; right here on Amazon. People can get it in just a&nbsp;&nbsp; couple days. Um, and so I would love to just help&nbsp; set up people for, you know, that for that freedom&nbsp;&nbsp; and sovereignty and to learn more about it. So I&nbsp; thought maybe if you wanted to just talk a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit about the case for for Canada and then also&nbsp; the whistleblowers manual real quick and then we&nbsp;&nbsp; can dig deeper into topics into personal we'll go&nbsp; back to the personal sovereignty because that's&nbsp;&nbsp; really important one. Um, okay. Yeah. Case for&nbsp; Canada. So this was uh in 2015 in January we had a&nbsp;&nbsp; convention in Winnipeg over 200 delegates about a&nbsp; third of them indigenous people and we established&nbsp;&nbsp; the framework like what they're doing right now&nbsp; in England there had creating a constitution&nbsp;&nbsp; which really embodies the vision of what the&nbsp; republic should be and um we adopted originally&nbsp;&nbsp; we had a flag with an eagle on a tree and then&nbsp; the native people said well what about the two&nbsp;&nbsp; row wampam now the two wampam was the first&nbsp; original treaty between the eastern woodland&nbsp;&nbsp; natives and the Europeans when they came over. And&nbsp; the Europeans needed the natives in the east, both&nbsp;&nbsp; in America and Canada, because they were important&nbsp; in the fur trade. They were military allies when&nbsp;&nbsp; the French and the English were fighting each&nbsp; other. And so it was expedient for the Europeans&nbsp;&nbsp; to sign this treaty. And but what it said is that&nbsp; these two represent the the blue lines represent&nbsp;&nbsp; the Europeans and the indigenous going down&nbsp; the river together. One in their own ship, one&nbsp;&nbsp; in their own canoe. And that was the notion that&nbsp; we will share the land together. It won't be one&nbsp;&nbsp; over another. Right now the Europeans went against&nbsp; that. They broke that covenant with the natives,&nbsp;&nbsp; of course. Um like in America they said natives&nbsp; are just like they still say they're um they're&nbsp;&nbsp; like dependencies on the there's only America&nbsp; law and we don't recognize native sovereignty&nbsp;&nbsp; or anything like that. And in Canada is worse&nbsp; because they're all wards of the crown which means&nbsp;&nbsp; they don't even have legal status. They're not&nbsp; citizens. So Europeans kind of abregated that but&nbsp;&nbsp; indigen the traditional native people still hold&nbsp; to it and say our vision is that we will share&nbsp;&nbsp; the land together and that's what the Republic&nbsp; of Canada is. It's the model for it is it's a&nbsp;&nbsp; federation of different sovereign nations within&nbsp; the one umbrella of Canada and um that and the&nbsp;&nbsp; three stars represent the English, the French and&nbsp; the indigenous founding nations. So in the book we&nbsp;&nbsp; lay out how we put that vision into practice with&nbsp; the assemblies. Um also training people and that's&nbsp;&nbsp; why you know I'm so glad about the show today&nbsp; because I hope we can use it as a practical kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of training school. uh like this a visual manual&nbsp; of what we're talking about with people who've&nbsp;&nbsp; gone from the 90% of people who are still watching&nbsp; and and kind of not sure to the minority who are&nbsp;&nbsp; taking the next step to organize and put this into&nbsp; practice. And what we saying here all the time is&nbsp;&nbsp; uh you have to understand your own history as a&nbsp; people. Not what you get taught in school but the&nbsp;&nbsp; living history. And we've described that like we&nbsp; go into detail about like there was an attempted&nbsp;&nbsp; rebellion in Canada against the crown in 1837 and&nbsp; it got defeated. It's one of the reasons the crown&nbsp;&nbsp; and the church has had such power here. Um but&nbsp; all of that is again based on a fraudulent power&nbsp;&nbsp; called the crown. We can revoke and step out of&nbsp; it at any point. And we we give people a kind of&nbsp;&nbsp; how-to process of of just like we do in the common&nbsp; law training manual about how to set up a common&nbsp;&nbsp; law court. We showed you how on the ground you can&nbsp; do this. And we've had some really great times,&nbsp;&nbsp; some fun times. Like for example, uh when we&nbsp; formed the assembly in Vancouver, we went out&nbsp;&nbsp; uh and did a flag raising. We had a bag piper. It&nbsp; was so stirring. It was a Scottish in me coming&nbsp;&nbsp; out, right? It just brought tears to my eyes. This&nbsp; bag piper was playing. There was a whole group of&nbsp;&nbsp; us there and we brought down the Canadian flag&nbsp; and raised the Republic of Canada flag, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; And then there was about two dozen people there&nbsp; uh who were newcomers. They all in unison took&nbsp;&nbsp; the oath of allegiance to the republic. So they&nbsp; revoked their their allegiance to Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;&nbsp; and her descendants and the Canadian government&nbsp; and laws and we took it to the the republic and&nbsp;&nbsp; they signed their citizenship cards. And at that&nbsp; point they operated within their own jurisdiction&nbsp;&nbsp; and that is so powerful when people do that&nbsp; together because then they say okay we have an&nbsp;&nbsp; obligation to protect each other now to work with&nbsp; each other. It's kind of a glue that brings people&nbsp;&nbsp; together rather than just another idea floating&nbsp; around the internet that never like I say it's&nbsp;&nbsp; uh ideas by themselves are like steam okay it&nbsp; dissipates all over u but but a when you're doing&nbsp;&nbsp; u the republic and the common courts you need a&nbsp; piston to move the steam so the rather the steam&nbsp;&nbsp; moves the piston that's you bring together the&nbsp; vision the spirit with the practical organization&nbsp;&nbsp; And then you get movement. But you can't&nbsp; have it without with steam or a piston on&nbsp;&nbsp; on them by themselves. Don't do it. You need&nbsp; their combination. And that's how we view this&nbsp;&nbsp; work. You know, the ideas are the first step in&nbsp; the discussion, but it's got to lead to these&nbsp;&nbsp; practical operations. You know, so we're thinking&nbsp; I say to people, don't think theoretically&nbsp;&nbsp; anymore. Think operationally, right? And think of&nbsp; how you're going to put it into operation in your&nbsp;&nbsp; own neighborhood. Absolutely. And then we have&nbsp; gone over this one in depth on um on a another&nbsp;&nbsp; episode. Um but this is one of my favorite books&nbsp; just because it really fits the theme over all of&nbsp;&nbsp; this podcast and people listening, but I think it&nbsp; also definitely complements the topic today which&nbsp;&nbsp; is your whistleblower manual. Yeah. Well, I mean,&nbsp; I had fun writing it because I was just drawing on&nbsp;&nbsp; my own experience and writing it in a very kind of&nbsp; basic way for people. So, that um honestly, okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; we're dealing with big institutions and that's to&nbsp; our advantage because they have a set way they can&nbsp;&nbsp; operate, but we can maneuver. We have the freedom&nbsp; to to outmaneuver them. And here's how you do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I kind of lead it through. first thing they're&nbsp; going to do if you're ever targeted for anything&nbsp;&nbsp; uh and you you hold some evidence or some&nbsp; important information that they don't want coming&nbsp;&nbsp; out, the first thing they're going to do to you is&nbsp; is it's all about silence in you. So, they don't&nbsp;&nbsp; want to get too heavy because that draws more&nbsp; attention to you. So, they seduce you by saying,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, oh, we can work this out. Uh, just don't go&nbsp; to the press. We can work this out. Now, most&nbsp;&nbsp; people want to do that. They don't want to have a&nbsp; confrontation. If they think they can, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; work it out with any hassle, they will. What? And&nbsp; that that's what happened to me. They said, "Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; let's negotiate." When they fired me without cause&nbsp; highlighted these disappeared children and the&nbsp;&nbsp; land deals and everything going on, the land theft&nbsp; by the church and big money and the government,&nbsp;&nbsp; they said they we went into negotiation, but&nbsp; all that did stretched out over four months. At&nbsp;&nbsp; the end, they canled the negotiations. It was&nbsp; just designed to tie me up so that I couldn't&nbsp;&nbsp; go public with stuff. And that gave them the&nbsp; time to destroy evidence, silence witnesses,&nbsp;&nbsp; arrange their own narrative so that when I&nbsp; did go public, they could say, "Oh yeah, well,&nbsp;&nbsp; we've we know about, you know, Kevin, he's got a&nbsp; bad history, blah, blah, blah." They had all their&nbsp;&nbsp; PR guys in place. They needed time to do that.&nbsp; So, what I say to people in here is that whenever&nbsp;&nbsp; you're you're holding important evidence and&nbsp; you're willing to go public with it, just do it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't wait for anybody else. Don't rely on&nbsp; your adversary to do the right thing because&nbsp;&nbsp; they never will. They're they have two priorities&nbsp; in a corporation whether it's church, government,&nbsp;&nbsp; business, anybody. Um efficiency and growth,&nbsp; right? They have to hold on and these are machine&nbsp;&nbsp; priorities not human priorities, right? and uh&nbsp; they have to sustain themselves and people you&nbsp;&nbsp; know inconvenient whistleblowers or whoever get&nbsp; in the way of that. So they have a whole protocol&nbsp;&nbsp; that we've learned about how they deal with people&nbsp; like us. And so we go into all the lessons of that&nbsp;&nbsp; and of course Sunsu and the art of war. I say to&nbsp; people, if you really want an education, go to&nbsp;&nbsp; the back of this book and read the 50 points, the&nbsp; excerpts from SunSu. And um you know, you'll learn&nbsp;&nbsp; a lot right there because uh something as basic&nbsp; as never operate on the terrain of your enemy or&nbsp;&nbsp; you've lost the battle. And that's what everybody&nbsp; does. When you get upset, what do you do? You have&nbsp;&nbsp; a protest. Well, they're ready for protests.&nbsp; They want protests, you know, because you're,&nbsp;&nbsp; no matter how angry or determined people are,&nbsp; you're still asking for something from somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; in authority and all they have to do is ignore you&nbsp; and there goes your power. But if you don't worry&nbsp;&nbsp; about asking like we did eventually after many&nbsp; mistakes and years of struggle on this, we said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay, well, we'll set up our commonal courts&nbsp; and put you guys on trial. Now you have to answer&nbsp;&nbsp; this." And look at the disproportionate effect.&nbsp; Two dozen of us force out the truth in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp; We go on to force rat singinger out of power&nbsp; because they don't know what to do when you're&nbsp;&nbsp; taking the initiative all the time and you know&nbsp; it's always basic strategy that you have to hold&nbsp;&nbsp; that initiative at all time and set the train of&nbsp; battle and do everything on your terms and that's&nbsp;&nbsp; in a way kind of leads us to the whole issue of&nbsp; personal sovereignty because that's difficult for&nbsp;&nbsp; people because we haven't learned that we haven't&nbsp; learned how to govern ourselves yet but this is&nbsp;&nbsp; one of the ways you learn by learning. You know,&nbsp; the best teacher is a black eye, right? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; you learn from it. And as long as you don't&nbsp; give up and it's a tragedy when people give up&nbsp;&nbsp; because then how do they apply all the brutality&nbsp; they've been through? How do you pass it on to&nbsp;&nbsp; the people if you're just going to crawl away and&nbsp; die somewhere? So, we can't do that. We've got to&nbsp;&nbsp; share at all times what we've been through with&nbsp; each other, right? 100%. Yes. And like I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; these books are all on Amazon. I would highly&nbsp; recommend purchasing them and especially if&nbsp;&nbsp; you guys know other people who are are sort of&nbsp; thought leaders like you. These make really great&nbsp;&nbsp; gifts or recommendations also and they support&nbsp; Kevin so he can keep doing this work. So these&nbsp;&nbsp; are all on Amazon. Um the truth tellers shield&nbsp; the whistleblower manual. Um like I said that&nbsp;&nbsp; one can really apply to to anybody and everybody&nbsp; watching this channel. I think that's something&nbsp;&nbsp; that's a theme throughout every single episode&nbsp; is is that courage and sometimes there's a lot&nbsp;&nbsp; to learn in the hardest things that we could ever&nbsp; go through and these conversations demonstrate&nbsp;&nbsp; that and hearing Kevin's personal experience um&nbsp; is really inspiring for what he's learned as a&nbsp;&nbsp; whistleblower and they're very positive things.&nbsp; And we also just did an episode with Juliet Engel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Um that was really along those lines also on that&nbsp; personal sovereignty and and whistleblowing and&nbsp;&nbsp; lessons learned and how to keep going. So I'm&nbsp; going to have that episode linked below. If you&nbsp;&nbsp; guys missed that one, definitely go back and watch&nbsp; it. It was a really beautiful episode. But Kevin,&nbsp;&nbsp; let's talk more about the personal aspect of&nbsp; this. Right. So, um, we're raised in a culture&nbsp;&nbsp; that's very atomized and individualized. So, we&nbsp; talk about individual rights like they're an end&nbsp;&nbsp; in themselves rather than just part of a bigger&nbsp; collective. And um the the genius of the American&nbsp;&nbsp; Constitution was that they balance both. Like it&nbsp; said, we have unalienable liberties. Nobody can&nbsp;&nbsp; can take those from you. They're born in you, but&nbsp; they only exist when you practice them. But you&nbsp;&nbsp; don't practice them in isolation from everybody&nbsp; else because I mean the the best quote about that&nbsp;&nbsp; was right as the Civil War was starting in 1861.&nbsp; Abraham Lincoln um let me read this. He said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Many of our countrymen speak of liberty and we&nbsp; are much in want of a proper definition of the&nbsp;&nbsp; word. Some men see liberty as a right to do&nbsp; what they will with themselves while others&nbsp;&nbsp; see it as a right to do what they will with&nbsp; other men." Referring to slavery. Right? Here&nbsp;&nbsp; we have two different and mutually exclusive&nbsp; understandings of the same word yet each side&nbsp;&nbsp; calling it the same thing, liberty. Right? So&nbsp; when people say freedom, what are they talking&nbsp;&nbsp; about? Is it like my freedom to do whatever&nbsp; I want? No. Uh in the French Constitution,&nbsp;&nbsp; in the French Revolution, they said in 1792, they&nbsp; said freedom is the right to do anything that&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't harm another. Okay? So that's a simple&nbsp; thing. your right doesn't then boom cross over&nbsp;&nbsp; somebody else's right and then it's not a right&nbsp; it's a privilege and I experienced that when we&nbsp;&nbsp; formed the first assemblies um because in some&nbsp; of these communities the people were fairly well&nbsp;&nbsp; off I remember we had a on Vancouver Island in a&nbsp; place called Parksville we had a meeting in this&nbsp;&nbsp; guy's it was a mansion it was like a really big&nbsp; big house and a lot of these other people were&nbsp;&nbsp; either retired or they had professions they had&nbsp; good careers but they were upset about the COVID&nbsp;&nbsp; restrictions Right. And they didn't want to have&nbsp; the restrictions. And I said, "Well, actually,&nbsp;&nbsp; these restrictions have been on a lot of people."&nbsp; And they they said, "What do you mean?" I said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, well, native people under the Indian Act, you&nbsp; can't refuse medical treatment. Like since 1874,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's been like that in Canada." Um, they had to&nbsp; have special passes to leave the reservation or&nbsp;&nbsp; they' go to jail. And they still operate under&nbsp; that. And they're all sitting there. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; but what does that have to do with CO? And I&nbsp; said, "Well, why do you think they can get away&nbsp;&nbsp; with CO?" because they were trying it out on&nbsp; all these other groups. So, we've got to see&nbsp;&nbsp; beyond our living room here and they didn't like&nbsp; that. Some people thought it was cool, but most&nbsp;&nbsp; people were threatened by that. And frankly, that&nbsp; assembly fell apart quick because they were just&nbsp;&nbsp; thinking of themselves and they wanted to hold.&nbsp; And I said, well, if a right is just for you,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a privilege and you're trying to hold on&nbsp; to a privilege. But a right only exists when&nbsp;&nbsp; it's for everybody. Okay? everybody including the&nbsp; ones they're calling you know illegal immigrants&nbsp;&nbsp; and all that we're all human beings we all have&nbsp; the right you know a country based on immigration&nbsp;&nbsp; the country that grew up because you know the&nbsp; statue of liberty there saying you're welcome&nbsp;&nbsp; because we want the model of the republic to be&nbsp; shared with everyone all over the world you know&nbsp;&nbsp; um so that idea of individual versus collective&nbsp; in the American constitution the idea was that you&nbsp;&nbsp; only get individual liberties is secured when the&nbsp; whole republic is intact. Like John Adams said,&nbsp;&nbsp; unless we have a virtuous citizenry, you can't&nbsp; have a republic. A virtuous people are always&nbsp;&nbsp; thinking of their neighbor. They're not just&nbsp; thinking of themselves. They want to take care of&nbsp;&nbsp; the neighbor. And I was raised that way in my my&nbsp; family in Winnipeg because we were descended from&nbsp;&nbsp; this kind of extended Scottish clan. And in the&nbsp; Scottish clan system, like with the indigenous,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, everybody takes care of everybody else. You&nbsp; don't I was raised to think and to and to practice&nbsp;&nbsp; um you don't worry about yourself. You worry about&nbsp; each other and then you hold each other up. The&nbsp;&nbsp; individual is sacri but only as part of the nation&nbsp; right and um and so that's how they come together.&nbsp;&nbsp; The personal but people of raised in a very&nbsp; individualistic culture um you know me me first&nbsp;&nbsp; and they equate that with liberty. it doesn't&nbsp; work. Um because you're always fighting somebody&nbsp;&nbsp; else and guess who profits from that. You know,&nbsp; when everyone's fighting everybody else, you get&nbsp;&nbsp; a few elites coming in and they say, "Well, then&nbsp; trust me." Right? Um and and it was interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another really good guy to read is his name is&nbsp; Alexis Dtoqueville and he was a French nobleman&nbsp;&nbsp; uh aristocrat who came to America in the 1830s.&nbsp; He wrote a book called Democracy in America.&nbsp;&nbsp; And as an outsider, it's brilliant because he sees&nbsp; things that Americans don't. And he said, "America&nbsp;&nbsp; will be prone to dictatorship because everyone and&nbsp; every farmer," he went around the country and look&nbsp;&nbsp; because most people are living on the land and&nbsp; they had their own farm and everything, very few&nbsp;&nbsp; of them were city dwellers. And he said, "Everyone&nbsp; is so concerned about their individual liberty,&nbsp;&nbsp; which is unique. You don't see that in in Europe,&nbsp; the idea of individual rights, but everyone is so&nbsp;&nbsp; concerned about their own life that the the job of&nbsp; politics and governance will be then handed over&nbsp;&nbsp; to a few people and that will lead to tyranny. So&nbsp; America has that that black and white kind of two&nbsp;&nbsp; aspects, two-headed aspects to them. You know,&nbsp; everyone's talking about liberty, but in fact,&nbsp;&nbsp; look at, you know, the electoral college system.&nbsp; The Supreme Court are all political appointees.&nbsp;&nbsp; um you know a few people in charge get the&nbsp; right to say well we don't agree with the&nbsp;&nbsp; election results us electors should put this&nbsp; guy in instead of the one who got most votes&nbsp;&nbsp; right I mean that's that was all designed to keep&nbsp; power in the hands of a few while talking about&nbsp;&nbsp; liberty for all so we've got to get from kind of&nbsp; that's why the thing in America is so exciting&nbsp;&nbsp; this new development because we're getting back&nbsp; to the original notion that the I is part of we&nbsp;&nbsp; and they're not separate at all and um so anyway&nbsp; That's a new idea for some people, but it's really&nbsp;&nbsp; at the heart of what liberty really is about&nbsp; if it's meant for everybody. Right. Right. Now,&nbsp;&nbsp; sort of piggybacking off of the Declaration&nbsp; of Independence here in America, what does it&nbsp;&nbsp; usually take to overturn something like that to&nbsp; where it can be instituted on a national level or&nbsp;&nbsp; a local level as the new law, the new um the new&nbsp; declaration? Uh how does that work? Like do you&nbsp;&nbsp; do you know like a percentage of the population&nbsp; that has to get on board with that or what it&nbsp;&nbsp; takes to overturn something like that? Well, it's&nbsp; funny because states have different precedents for&nbsp;&nbsp; that and like in America it's you know there state&nbsp; governments are almost autonomous. I mean like you&nbsp;&nbsp; look at a state like Vermont and its laws and then&nbsp; compare it to South Carolina and it's like whoa&nbsp;&nbsp; different countries right? Um but they they have&nbsp; a tradition. I know I'll give you an example in&nbsp;&nbsp; Pennsylvania um and I I worked with a group there&nbsp; who enacted this. It was beautiful to watch. In&nbsp;&nbsp; Pennsylvania it says uh people have the right to&nbsp; uh devolve power back to their community. And it's&nbsp;&nbsp; called having a home rule charter. And you don't&nbsp; need a percentage of the people. You just need u&nbsp;&nbsp; Americans in a community to write up this charter.&nbsp; And you can pass your own laws which are more&nbsp;&nbsp; valid than the state law. And the example in in in&nbsp; case the case in point was um about 10 years ago&nbsp;&nbsp; now in Pennsylvania in um in a county in central&nbsp; Pennsylvania um Adams County I believe they u&nbsp;&nbsp; the Pennsylvania General Energy was going to take&nbsp; frack water. Now you know fracking it's u polluted&nbsp;&nbsp; water right and they were going to dump it on&nbsp; the land and about 700 people live there and this&nbsp;&nbsp; woman and her daughter uh they're amazing people&nbsp; they got together and they started going around&nbsp;&nbsp; door to door and saying everybody Republican and&nbsp; Democrat and people who never voted they said look&nbsp;&nbsp; we got to unite here and stop this so they they&nbsp; headed assembly they passed the home rule charter&nbsp;&nbsp; and their first law was they abolished all dumping&nbsp; of wastewater land uh fracking on their land. They&nbsp;&nbsp; had a long legal battle for it and um eventually&nbsp; they won. It took them a long time, but they just&nbsp;&nbsp; stuck to their guns and they just cited the P&nbsp; Pennsylvania State Constitution. So this is the&nbsp;&nbsp; beauty of America. It's already there. Like in&nbsp; in Canada and England, well Canada especially,&nbsp;&nbsp; we've never had self-governance. We've never had&nbsp; it. So we do have to challenge the system head on.&nbsp;&nbsp; In America, you just have to take it back. You&nbsp; just have to reclaim it. What's already there,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's already there in the hearts and minds of&nbsp; people. And it's also there in your own laws.&nbsp;&nbsp; But a lot of those laws are being nullified now&nbsp; with this corporate system we've got. Like I've&nbsp;&nbsp; told you the examples of these guys in Texas&nbsp; who set up a common law group and they all got&nbsp;&nbsp; targeted and some of them are doing like a hundred&nbsp; years in jail, right, for not appearing in court.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just um my friend in in Chicago, he went&nbsp; into the Catholic church and handed the priest&nbsp;&nbsp; a copy of my book and said, "Are you aware of&nbsp; this policy of criminal where Catholic priests&nbsp;&nbsp; have to and any Catholic has to cover up child&nbsp; abuse?" The priest calls the police. The police&nbsp;&nbsp; come and arrest my friend for talking to a priest&nbsp; and they hand him a ticket and said, "You're up to&nbsp;&nbsp; appear in court." He walks into a room. It's not a&nbsp; court. with a camera staring at him and the voice&nbsp;&nbsp; out of the camera says, "How do you plead?" And&nbsp; he said, "For what? You're not a court. You're a&nbsp;&nbsp; camera." He said, "You have to plead or you'll go&nbsp; to jail." Said, "This is not due process. It's not&nbsp;&nbsp; a court." And he pled not guilty and they put him&nbsp; in jail anyway. Like, does that sound like the law&nbsp;&nbsp; to you? Does that sound like due process? That's&nbsp; what goes on all the time. And especially with&nbsp;&nbsp; the fervor now over immigration and the ICE has a&nbsp; bigger budget than any other federal agency now.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's huge. And it's all about stripping people&nbsp; of their inherent liberties and locking them away&nbsp;&nbsp; for the private prison industry, right? And the&nbsp; for-profit prisons, if you look at a map of them,&nbsp;&nbsp; like a big company like Geo, which is one of the&nbsp; biggest for-profit prisons all over the South,&nbsp;&nbsp; all over Texas and the southern states, and&nbsp; they make money by getting judges on their&nbsp;&nbsp; payroll to criminalize misdemeanors like failure&nbsp; to repair in court. 20 years bang because you're&nbsp;&nbsp; making lots of money for GEO that way and uh&nbsp; the attorney general in Washington Pondi is&nbsp;&nbsp; a former lobbyist for the private prisons till&nbsp; 2019 and she's the attorney general helping them&nbsp;&nbsp; by saying okay hit people hard with sentences&nbsp; so that we can profit and that's so in a way in&nbsp;&nbsp; theory it's all there in America what we need&nbsp; but at the same time there's this other entity&nbsp;&nbsp; that's come in which has almost turned everything&nbsp; the clock right back. So in a practical sense,&nbsp;&nbsp; Americans do have to have another revolution&nbsp; literally. And the more people you have in it,&nbsp;&nbsp; the less violent it is, right? You get go to the&nbsp; police, you say stop, you know, stop serving this&nbsp;&nbsp; this corporate power and get back to what you&nbsp; know the republic supposed to be. But that can&nbsp;&nbsp; only happen if you've got something to present to&nbsp; them as an alternative. And that's why like the&nbsp;&nbsp; um one of the guys John Bradley who's uh chairing&nbsp; one of these con they call them constitutional&nbsp;&nbsp; conventions they set up a constitutional assembly&nbsp; that reestablishes the republic in their community&nbsp;&nbsp; and they say this is the republic now because you&nbsp; can't find in Washington you can't find in the&nbsp;&nbsp; courts um and you know they in the FBI and RCMP&nbsp; training manual says now and I've seen a copy of&nbsp;&nbsp; this anyone who uses the word sovereignty is a&nbsp; potential domestic terrorist. What? Well, that&nbsp;&nbsp; would include Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, all&nbsp; the founding fathers are now domestic terrorists.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, they've hyped up the police to think, oh, you&nbsp; talk sovereignty, you talk the Bill of Rights,&nbsp;&nbsp; and you're a terrorist. It's like it's this&nbsp; counterrevolution that's happened and we have&nbsp;&nbsp; to get back to who we are. And that's kind&nbsp; of the reality of what we're in right now,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Absolutely. Yes. And so in working with&nbsp; people to establish sovereignty in all these&nbsp;&nbsp; different levels and especially for example these&nbsp; groups that that you're currently working with,&nbsp;&nbsp; um I'd like for you to talk a little bit&nbsp; maybe about some obstacles, some roadblocks,&nbsp;&nbsp; some things to expect along the way and sort of&nbsp; how you help groups and how you've done yourself,&nbsp;&nbsp; how you've navigated those different things. cuz&nbsp; obviously this all sounds so great and we need to&nbsp;&nbsp; empower people to to go through that and to be&nbsp; able to get through it whenever there's those&nbsp;&nbsp; different things that might try to deter them.&nbsp; It's not easy. It's you got to be honest with&nbsp;&nbsp; people right up front. Say we're not promising you&nbsp; anything. There's no quick fix for this because&nbsp;&nbsp; it's taken years and years for this thing to come&nbsp; into place, this corporate dictatorship we're in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right? And so it's a lifelong commitment and it's&nbsp; something you have to teach your children because&nbsp;&nbsp; they're going to be involved in this. It's not&nbsp; going to happen overnight, but there's ways that&nbsp;&nbsp; we've learned that you can act now to increase&nbsp; the odds on more in our favor. Um, first of all,&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't go public right away and you don't&nbsp; invite all these people into an assembly because&nbsp;&nbsp; it falls apart quickly because there's no common&nbsp; ground. there's different levels of understanding&nbsp;&nbsp; and commitment and it it becomes crazy that people&nbsp; are it's like trying to hurt cats. You're just&nbsp;&nbsp; there's no common ground. So what you do is you&nbsp; find a few people who are aware who've known each&nbsp;&nbsp; other because you can't do this work without trust&nbsp; and knowing each other and you form a little cell&nbsp;&nbsp; group of three or four people and you start doing&nbsp; things in small ways um and probing and finding&nbsp;&nbsp; out local sympathetic police and and doing the&nbsp; education process and eventually you get you each&nbsp;&nbsp; of let's say you have a cell of three people. Each&nbsp; one of those three goes out and recruits three&nbsp;&nbsp; other people and you you go through a training&nbsp; education process and then after a while there's&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 of you and so you can then sign a charter and&nbsp; form a local republic assembly. That way you know&nbsp;&nbsp; each other and if the boot comes down you split&nbsp; off into the cell groups again, right? And it's&nbsp;&nbsp; more secure. It's like what you do in a in a&nbsp; police state. you have and when you read tales&nbsp;&nbsp; from like resistance movements like the French&nbsp; resistance and I've talked to people who were in&nbsp;&nbsp; it during World War II when I was younger and they&nbsp; all operated that way. They had to have the cell&nbsp;&nbsp; groups because they couldn't be infiltrated as&nbsp; easily. You know, if you have a big organization,&nbsp;&nbsp; it'll get taken out and I've been through that a&nbsp; lot. I know like all the signs. So, start small&nbsp;&nbsp; but realize that in your in your smallness is&nbsp; your strength and you can keep control over it,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? It isn't some organization run by experts,&nbsp; you know, and you see that a lot on the internet,&nbsp;&nbsp; like I'm the expert. Follow this blueprint&nbsp; and you've you'll be free. But they're just&nbsp;&nbsp; talking to individuals. They don't have a sense of&nbsp; okay, but how do we does that work for the whole&nbsp;&nbsp; community? Right? So that's kind of like basic&nbsp; common sense, but the thing that's lacking is&nbsp;&nbsp; the the determination, the will to carry on all&nbsp; the time. And it's exciting when your when your&nbsp;&nbsp; life finds that purpose. You know, the kind&nbsp; of the personal things we deal with in a day,&nbsp;&nbsp; they suddenly lose their importance. Um I my dad&nbsp; had a a story from the Korean War where he said,&nbsp;&nbsp; um there was this medic in their unit and they&nbsp; were under fire and he would always be running&nbsp;&nbsp; around tending people and people were saying, you&nbsp; know, look at this guy. He's right out there on&nbsp;&nbsp; the front lines. He has no fear. And he got hit&nbsp; by shrapnel. Boom, boom, boom. and he's running&nbsp;&nbsp; around bleeding from the shrapnel and somebody&nbsp; says, "Do you need help?" He says,"I don't have&nbsp;&nbsp; time for shrapnel. I'm too busy here." Right? And&nbsp; I always remember that quote like, "I don't have&nbsp;&nbsp; time for this." Like, "Okay, so I'm hit with&nbsp; shrapnel. Doesn't matter. These guys are dying&nbsp;&nbsp; over here." Okay? And that's what the difference&nbsp; between commitment and u just uh being observer,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Because when you learn under fire is the&nbsp; only way to learn that what happens to you. Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; it matters. But it's not as important as if you're&nbsp; just sitting there in a room by yourself where&nbsp;&nbsp; you become so totally self-obsessed and and&nbsp; the culture feeds into that, right? You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; um all the time they try to get you just kept&nbsp; in your little mental bubble and not connect&nbsp;&nbsp; with other people. So once you get out there&nbsp; and start doing things and I say to people,&nbsp;&nbsp; it doesn't even matter what you do, just do&nbsp; something. Like Napoleon said when he was asked,&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you plan a battle?" He said, "I never&nbsp; plan a battle. I start something and I see what&nbsp;&nbsp; happens." Because a battle of any kind is like&nbsp; life. It shifts all the time. It's constantly&nbsp;&nbsp; in motion and shifts and all your blueprints go&nbsp; out the window. You've got to always be observant&nbsp;&nbsp; on the ground what's going on and adapt and think&nbsp; in new strategies and tactics thinking creatively&nbsp;&nbsp; like that, right? So, it's a very exciting&nbsp; process because you have a sense after a&nbsp;&nbsp; while of waking up for the first time, right? Um&nbsp; people under fire say, "I never felt more alive&nbsp;&nbsp; than when when we're getting shot at." Because&nbsp; life achieves like finally see the meaning of&nbsp;&nbsp; it. Every moment of life is so precious. You've&nbsp; got to use every moment and as opposed to kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of this nineto-five dead existence were raised to&nbsp; think that is life and it isn't. Right. So yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; that story really touches my heart. It's a&nbsp; really relatable way of sort of explaining&nbsp;&nbsp; how myself and I think everybody that you know&nbsp; every whistleblower, every survivor going forward,&nbsp;&nbsp; that's like a big question I'm sure you get and&nbsp; something that's come up on the show sometimes&nbsp;&nbsp; is you know pursuing action despite the obstacles&nbsp; that come in your path. And I think that really&nbsp;&nbsp; does come from elevating your your purpose to&nbsp; something bigger than you. You know, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp; we have a part in it and we have to take care&nbsp; of ourselves through it to make sure that we can&nbsp;&nbsp; sustain the endurance and the marathon. Like you&nbsp; said, change just doesn't happen right overnight&nbsp;&nbsp; because we get passionate about something. But I&nbsp; think it helps also really sort of deflect those&nbsp;&nbsp; bullets that that come towards us too because&nbsp; it's like how we see in your story. You've been&nbsp;&nbsp; defamed. You've had everything taken from you.&nbsp; You've had smear campaigns. I mean, the whole&nbsp;&nbsp; gambit has been thrown at you. you know, quarter&nbsp; million dollar smear campaigns against one man,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, and so I'm sure you get asked all the&nbsp; time, you know, how did you keep going or why did&nbsp;&nbsp; you keep going? And I think when we understand&nbsp; the the consequence of not going forward,&nbsp;&nbsp; the cost of human life in the case of what&nbsp; we're talking about, you know, genocide,&nbsp;&nbsp; when you think about that, that that's still&nbsp; happening. This isn't just the past that you're&nbsp;&nbsp; talking about, even though you referenced the&nbsp; past because that was where your journey started,&nbsp;&nbsp; but this is still going on today. And so the cost&nbsp; of not moving forward is this continuing and it's&nbsp;&nbsp; still just being covered up. And so I feel like&nbsp; when we know something and when we know change&nbsp;&nbsp; needs to take place, there's an honor in carrying&nbsp; that because we get to carry that for the people&nbsp;&nbsp; that didn't make it out of those situations and&nbsp; that are still in it that wish that they could be&nbsp;&nbsp; in our shoes. You know, I try to think about these&nbsp; kids in these schools that you advocate for and,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, all the different types of survivors&nbsp; that you advocate for of all different, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; abuse types, but how any of those children would&nbsp; just give anything to be able to have a voice,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, especially as they grow into an adult&nbsp; if they survive these systems, you know? So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it really is like it becomes an honor to get to&nbsp; fight and the bullets don't you you almost sort&nbsp;&nbsp; of repel them naturally because it's like go ahead&nbsp; and attack me. Like, it's not about me. I'm doing&nbsp;&nbsp; this for other people. So, go ahead and attack&nbsp; me all you want, but I need to go, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; into this burning building and get these people&nbsp; out. You know, you can shoot at me all you want,&nbsp;&nbsp; but there's people being hurt right now that I&nbsp; need to attend to. Well, that thing about the&nbsp;&nbsp; burning building is really important. I'm glad you&nbsp; raised it because there's a a if you see a child&nbsp;&nbsp; in a burning building, you don't worry about&nbsp; the flames. There's this natural thing and you&nbsp;&nbsp; don't have to be the child's mother either. Anyone&nbsp; will boom, go in there and what is that? I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's it's so inherent in us, right? And um that's&nbsp; why I say to people um for your own, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; kind of well-being, you can never do anything by&nbsp; yourself because they love that. Then they go,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, good. We're going to make an example of this&nbsp; person." Bang. Throw them away for 20 years. When&nbsp;&nbsp; people tell the horror stories, I always say,&nbsp; "Yeah, but the person in a way brought it on&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves because they tried to do it on their&nbsp; own." You never just declare, "I'm not paying&nbsp;&nbsp; taxes to Uncle Sam anymore." No, you form an&nbsp; assembly and pass a law and say, "We're keeping&nbsp;&nbsp; federal tax on our community. and 50 people do&nbsp; that. It's harder to target target 50 than one.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we got to start thinking together, you know,&nbsp; not just how to do it, but doing it together at&nbsp;&nbsp; all times. You never like another tip, you never&nbsp; go in if you want to challenge somebody or you&nbsp;&nbsp; go into a court or whatever, you never go by&nbsp; yourself. You always have two or three witnesses&nbsp;&nbsp; and somebody with a camera so you have a record&nbsp; of everything. And so just learning to operate&nbsp;&nbsp; that way is a new way of thinking for people but&nbsp; it's it's essential otherwise you don't last long&nbsp;&nbsp; and you get used and you know I mean I've seen too&nbsp; many people who do that who don't learn the lesson&nbsp;&nbsp; and that's what these books are all about passing&nbsp; the on these truths right yes and so speaking of&nbsp;&nbsp; court obviously that is a big part of this is&nbsp; trying to get some type of of law established&nbsp;&nbsp; in our communities that becomes in official&nbsp; law and overwrites whatever wasn't working. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; how do we enforce these court orders? Like what's&nbsp; important to know about going to court? At what&nbsp;&nbsp; point would would a group want to do that and&nbsp; what do they need to prepare for that? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; we're talking about exactly that issue with&nbsp; this group in Texas that's been so targeted. And&nbsp;&nbsp; uh the first problem was they went into the&nbsp; existing courts and what's set up now. They're&nbsp;&nbsp; not courts of law operating according to due&nbsp; process. They're more like military courts,&nbsp;&nbsp; administrative tribunals, where there's no due&nbsp; process. You're not assumed to be innocent. Uh&nbsp;&nbsp; you're assumed to be guilty and it's up to you.&nbsp; Like like in a a heresy trial in the Middle Ages&nbsp;&nbsp; or what I went through. You have to go along and&nbsp; agree with the system and help destroy yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, you get, you know, you're you're&nbsp; somehow looking guilty for not doing that. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't go into the existing what are called&nbsp; courts at all. And if they try to come for you,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's ways you can defend yourself. It always&nbsp; involves other people. It declans going to the&nbsp;&nbsp; police locally and saying, you know, that I don't&nbsp; recognize that jurisdiction of that court over&nbsp;&nbsp; me. And in fact, there's things like habius&nbsp; corpus and mandamus rits that you can you can&nbsp;&nbsp; uh file in local court registry and it says&nbsp; I'm transferring if you're being targeted. If&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a case against you, you say, "Okay, but&nbsp; I'm transferring the jurisdiction from this false&nbsp;&nbsp; court that has no authority over me into our own&nbsp; common law court, which we've established here,&nbsp;&nbsp; which does have jurisdiction because it's based on&nbsp; universal common law." And uh and so we, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we've helped people do that, but you need a&nbsp; team around you to do that. And that's why I&nbsp;&nbsp; say don't ever try it on your own. Don't go into&nbsp; their jurisdiction. contact us and we can help&nbsp;&nbsp; bring that's what I do 90% of the time now with&nbsp; people just bringing that support and knowledge&nbsp;&nbsp; to bear so that you don't walk in and put the&nbsp; noose around your own neck which often happens&nbsp;&nbsp; um enforcement the power of enforcement in common&nbsp; courts is tremendous because everyone is empowered&nbsp;&nbsp; to enforce the verdict right in a common and&nbsp; that's why Ringer after we convicted him he&nbsp;&nbsp; hid out in the Vatican till the day he died&nbsp; because he knew anyone can enforce that vertic&nbsp;&nbsp; against him to arrest the guy. Um you know so&nbsp; any citizen is obligated to be deputized by&nbsp;&nbsp; a sheriff Kamla sheriff and in in effect made&nbsp; into a posy. Uh now that's got western movies&nbsp;&nbsp; and that have made it seem like a posi is like a&nbsp; lynch mob. It isn't. It comes from a Latin term&nbsp;&nbsp; from the English Shy communities in the Middle&nbsp; Ages. And every able-bodied man was expected to&nbsp;&nbsp; help defend the community. So somebody was found&nbsp; guilty of of murder or for example, everyone the&nbsp;&nbsp; posi were deputized local sheriffs who would then&nbsp; go and arrest the person to make sure they didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; harm anyone. Everyone has a obligation to do&nbsp; that. So you know this verdict, I say to people,&nbsp;&nbsp; we're holding this gun in our hand. We don't&nbsp; even realize the power of what we've done. Every&nbsp;&nbsp; Catholic priest in the world is part of a criminal&nbsp; conspiracy to protect child rapists. That means&nbsp;&nbsp; you have the right to go and not just arrest&nbsp; them as individuals but seize, you know, their&nbsp;&nbsp; buildings and assets, you know, and they have and&nbsp; they know that. You see, they're not stupid. They&nbsp;&nbsp; know people have that power now, but they rely&nbsp; on people's fear and ignorance, you know, to to&nbsp;&nbsp; not to prevent that enforcement of that. But we&nbsp; could reclaim the whole world tomorrow if people&nbsp;&nbsp; knew that because we own the world inherently.&nbsp; All of us, you know, according to natural law,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Especially when the people in power&nbsp; so-called power are convicted criminals. Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Exactly. And that's a hard realization, but you&nbsp; know, it it really is empowering to learn how our&nbsp;&nbsp; world works and then to realize that, hey, we've&nbsp; been letting all these people just rule over us.&nbsp;&nbsp; We've just been sitting back watching. It's time&nbsp; for us. like we can actually be the leaders of our&nbsp;&nbsp; world and take matters into our own hands. And&nbsp; so kind of speaking of that, so you established&nbsp;&nbsp; the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church&nbsp; and State. You mentioned a couple of these other&nbsp;&nbsp; groups have established a group that has a name.&nbsp; Um what would you recommend if people do want to&nbsp;&nbsp; have a group? Is it important to have sort of an&nbsp; established organizational name? Do they need to&nbsp;&nbsp; incorporate? Um what's kind of a step to do um&nbsp; that's the most effective in your opinion? Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; not incorporate because that's the system. You&nbsp; know that corpus means corpse dead. You know,&nbsp;&nbsp; you're you becoming a dead thing. Uh we don't&nbsp; do any of that. We um it's good to have a name&nbsp;&nbsp; and identity. You know that you know we belong&nbsp; to this now, right? We don't belong to the old&nbsp;&nbsp; system. That's why citizenship cards, a flag, um&nbsp; you know, a name for ourselves is very important.&nbsp;&nbsp; So um that yeah that's absolutely part of this&nbsp; whole process right thing to understand as well&nbsp;&nbsp; is that um allegiances are something drilled into&nbsp; somebody's head from birth and it's very hard to&nbsp;&nbsp; get people to switch an allegiance. So we don't&nbsp; language is very important. We don't use the word&nbsp;&nbsp; allegiance. Um it's slave master slave language&nbsp; like please and thank you. these terms we're all&nbsp;&nbsp; tra you know it's like subordinate um to plea in&nbsp; court to make a plea it's like you're pleading&nbsp;&nbsp; to the slave master right like these are terms&nbsp; all designed to program you to like the word&nbsp;&nbsp; arrogant taught that's bad to be arrogant um it&nbsp; the Italian word it comes from arrogati means to&nbsp;&nbsp; claim for yourself okay so why is that a bad thing&nbsp; it isn't but your brain wants to think when you're&nbsp;&nbsp; outget you're being bad Right? And and so you see&nbsp; the way we're all drilled to be functional slaves,&nbsp;&nbsp; even though don't they don't call it that,&nbsp; right? So when you start breaking out of that,&nbsp;&nbsp; um you can't it's too much of a mental shock&nbsp; to tell people we're ending this and beginning&nbsp;&nbsp; this. You say, "No, we're reclaiming we're&nbsp; reclaiming something that was always ours,&nbsp;&nbsp; but we've been kept in the dark. We're being kept&nbsp; asleep about all this stuff. Now awaken to this&nbsp;&nbsp; and just reclaim it." Because once you reclaim&nbsp; it, enough people do that, their whole system goes&nbsp;&nbsp; into the toilet because it's parasitic. It's&nbsp; a form of energy vampireism. It feeds off our&nbsp;&nbsp; attention. That's why I say to people, turn off&nbsp; the internet, folks. Those people don't matter.&nbsp;&nbsp; You know, look in the mirror, look at each other.&nbsp; That's that's how you get your power back. Thank&nbsp;&nbsp; you for sharing that. That's really interesting.&nbsp; I actually didn't know that even though I've I've&nbsp;&nbsp; thought about how strange it is that confidence&nbsp; is looked at you know they don't it's it's rarely&nbsp;&nbsp; heard that that that word arrogant and confidence&nbsp; sort of goes hand in hand but it's always denoted&nbsp;&nbsp; as this negative thing you know arrogance&nbsp; arrogance ego arrogance when I think when&nbsp;&nbsp; people don't have that then like you said they're&nbsp; very submissive and they give their power away to&nbsp;&nbsp; ar to actual arrogance people in the definition&nbsp; that society thinks that it is. Somebody is going&nbsp;&nbsp; to have power over us if it's not us. You&nbsp; know, if we don't take our own power back,&nbsp;&nbsp; then we're going to give it to somebody else to&nbsp; rule us, you know, for us. And so, I think that&nbsp;&nbsp; that's a really important distinction and it's&nbsp; really actually interesting how how, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; we've sort of forgotten the roots of some of these&nbsp; words, even genocide, like how we talked about&nbsp;&nbsp; the first time that that we chatted. Well, it's&nbsp; funny. I actually start the book in the intro here&nbsp;&nbsp; uh with best examples are from her own family. And&nbsp; so when my daughter Elellanar was really little,&nbsp;&nbsp; she had two favorite expressions. She always&nbsp; said, "You're not the boss of me." To everybody.&nbsp;&nbsp; She would say that to everybody and her teachers&nbsp; in school. You're not the boss of me. Which is&nbsp;&nbsp; true. Nobody's our boss. She also said, "But why?&nbsp; Why, Daddy? Why? Why?" She was always asking why.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had to know for herself because she knew&nbsp; that Elellanar was governing herself. She said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "I govern myself." Right now, you know, that's&nbsp; so common sense and it's every child knows that&nbsp;&nbsp; and that's why everything's designed to&nbsp; batter that out of them, that awareness,&nbsp;&nbsp; make them afraid of themselves, right?&nbsp; That way. But I always think that yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; the examples are so close to home. We just&nbsp; have to see it in our own family, our own life,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Yeah. We forget to that we have the power&nbsp; to ask why. and that we deserve an answer if&nbsp;&nbsp; there's going to be a law or somebody trying to&nbsp; govern over us or tell us what to do instead of&nbsp;&nbsp; just accepting it. You know, we'll complain about&nbsp; stuff without addressing that and saying, "Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; why?" You know, can we learn the reasons and make&nbsp; sure that this is a good outcome at the end first&nbsp;&nbsp; before this is just thrown on us as being the law&nbsp; or a rule or something that we have to abide by.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah. And and kind of a PS on that story, Ellaner&nbsp; is now studying law. No way. America. Proud dad.&nbsp;&nbsp; She Oh, I'm very proud of her. She's like me.&nbsp; She's like me. It's like human rights law, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; women in the law and and that kind of thing. So,&nbsp; she's a humanitarian like you. Well, she's Yeah,&nbsp;&nbsp; it carries on. I mean, and that's a metaphor&nbsp; for all of us like we are obligated to the next&nbsp;&nbsp; generation to pass this on, right? So absolutely&nbsp; on their shoulders. Yeah. And so in this quest&nbsp;&nbsp; going back to sort of the talking about getting&nbsp; people together, taking action in your experience,&nbsp;&nbsp; what have been some of the the big successes that&nbsp; you can share? And then also on the other end,&nbsp;&nbsp; what are some of the kind of pitfalls or failures&nbsp; that that you've gone through that that you've&nbsp;&nbsp; learned from and that we can learn from with you?&nbsp; Well, there have been so many victories, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and people expect huge immediate results from&nbsp; victory. I think it's part of the movie culture,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, when you see these things in television&nbsp; or movies. But, um, the victories are because it's&nbsp;&nbsp; all human. It's very, very personal and very&nbsp; up close. And, you know, when I saw people&nbsp;&nbsp; who couldn't even like the example of William&nbsp; Kums being in the church with us that day when&nbsp;&nbsp; the sound of a church bell would terrify him, make&nbsp; him vomit and there he is. He's like a new person.&nbsp;&nbsp; just the power of that. And when everyone saw him&nbsp; like that, we were in tears. We were embracing&nbsp;&nbsp; each other when we walked out of the church&nbsp; because we knew we had turned the tide there.&nbsp;&nbsp; And sure enough, that same month, the government&nbsp; started talking about apologies and missing&nbsp;&nbsp; children directly because we were occupying those&nbsp; churches. And the look in the eyes of those people&nbsp;&nbsp; and the sense we had among each other. These are&nbsp; mostly poor Aboriginal people who've been under&nbsp;&nbsp; the boot their whole life, okay, and traumatized&nbsp; and tortured from a young age. The hope in their&nbsp;&nbsp; eyes suddenly we caused that. Okay, we caused&nbsp; that. That was a victory that went boom. It it it&nbsp;&nbsp; just had it's still having a ripple effect, right?&nbsp; And you know when you tell people that they think&nbsp;&nbsp; well how could David have brought down Goliath&nbsp; like that like is that it doesn't sound possible&nbsp;&nbsp; but you got to experience once you experience it&nbsp; you know it's very possible it's more possible&nbsp;&nbsp; than people realize right that we've had a lot&nbsp; of things like that and um I mean another victory&nbsp;&nbsp; you there were 20,000 of us marching through the&nbsp; streets of London right when the pro when Pope&nbsp;&nbsp; Benedict came to London it was called the protest&nbsp; the pope march The organizers expected 500 people,&nbsp;&nbsp; 20,000 show up and we had the downtown part&nbsp; of London so shut down. Normally the London&nbsp;&nbsp; cops put in these barriers and guide people on&nbsp; we people were just pushing the barriers back.&nbsp;&nbsp; weren't afraid and the cops were kind of standing&nbsp; impotently over at the side not knowing what to&nbsp;&nbsp; do but there was 20,000 and we're passing Canada&nbsp; house which is the Canadian embassy right into&nbsp;&nbsp; Fogger Square and I thought oh [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] this is too&nbsp; good an opportunity to pass up so I pull out the&nbsp;&nbsp; bullhorn and I start saying to people I start&nbsp; talking about the Canadian genocide and these&nbsp;&nbsp; British people are really funny they're going&nbsp; oh no not Canada that couldn't have happened in&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada oh my god we didn't know anything about&nbsp; this and they start applauding and cheering&nbsp;&nbsp; And one funny thing that happened, I I hear&nbsp; a voice behind me. Oh, very well done. And&nbsp;&nbsp; I look around and there's Gandalf, you know, the&nbsp; actor who plays Gandalf uh in Lord of the Rings,&nbsp;&nbsp; uh Ian Mckllen. Okay, he's standing there. He's&nbsp; kind of he's like 6'4. He's kind of standing&nbsp;&nbsp; above me. He said, "Well done. Well done." And&nbsp; um I said, "Well, talk about this." And he said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "I certainly will." And then gave me a crushing&nbsp; handshake and uh carried on with his group. Right.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I thought like all of those things, it's just&nbsp; such beautiful memories and um you know, you've&nbsp;&nbsp; got them on the run at that point when people are&nbsp; that united and that happy. And I always say to&nbsp;&nbsp; people, I've gotten my my greatest joys in life&nbsp; when my daughters were born and I helped deliver&nbsp;&nbsp; them, but also um at those moments when people are&nbsp; united and they realize they can change the world,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? and and those are the the the heartfelt&nbsp; victories that they never steal from you. They&nbsp;&nbsp; always carry on those memories. Um the things&nbsp; that um the other side of the coin you said the&nbsp;&nbsp; uh mistakes or was it how did you put it? Yeah,&nbsp; I guess the kind of the pitfalls, the failures,&nbsp;&nbsp; the when you in a way when you uh you build up&nbsp; in your enthusiasm, you can say to people, okay,&nbsp;&nbsp; we're going to you can promise them things that&nbsp; you may not be able to deliver and that's not&nbsp;&nbsp; a good thing because when people get up their&nbsp; hopes and then it they crash, it's worse than&nbsp;&nbsp; if you never tried it. Yeah. And and it's set up&nbsp; that way. That's why they like the government and&nbsp;&nbsp; churches and others lead you down blind alleys,&nbsp; right? And say, "Okay, well, just come to court&nbsp;&nbsp; and we'll give you compensation." And then they&nbsp; don't. That that whole thing about the residential&nbsp;&nbsp; school survivors, they led them on with the&nbsp; belief that they could get justice through the&nbsp;&nbsp; courts. And in fact, they get a gag order and very&nbsp; little money and people, you know, I knew people&nbsp;&nbsp; would kill themselves in despair after that. So,&nbsp; it's designed to do that, the opposite of what I&nbsp;&nbsp; just talked about, the victory. It's designed to&nbsp; discourage, make people despairing, and then lock&nbsp;&nbsp; back up in their little poles again, right, where&nbsp; they won't do anything. So, you got to be careful&nbsp;&nbsp; the way, never promise too much. Don't take people&nbsp; down blind alleys. Um, and yet be be bold in&nbsp;&nbsp; those moments that come along. And again quoting&nbsp; Napoleon in every battle there is one moment of&nbsp;&nbsp; decisive moment. The key the great art is to seize&nbsp; that moment. Okay? So when you're you're part of a&nbsp;&nbsp; movement you'll see opportunities come along and&nbsp; if you strike at that moment strategically at the&nbsp;&nbsp; right place like we did, you win, you know, and&nbsp; doesn't matter how big the bad guy is, you'll win.&nbsp;&nbsp; And and so that's misjudging the moment that can&nbsp; you you're going to learn to think strategically&nbsp;&nbsp; all the time, right? Yeah. 100%. And I'd love&nbsp; to hear a little bit about sort of you have been&nbsp;&nbsp; very successful both with educating yourself on&nbsp; this and then implementing it into actual action.&nbsp;&nbsp; And you've obviously with your own work, you've&nbsp; been helping seize the land and recover the church&nbsp;&nbsp; buildings, you know, from this sort of evil uh&nbsp; generational, I should say, multi-generational&nbsp;&nbsp; um system that has been inhabiting it. I'd&nbsp; love to hear a little bit about how you've&nbsp;&nbsp; been sort of deestablishing this genocide that&nbsp; is happening in the church and crowns, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; cuz I think it's really neat just to see kind of&nbsp; your work in action and so that way we can sort of&nbsp;&nbsp; wrap our minds around things that we can do with&nbsp; whatever the causes that we're fighting for. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; you know, where the it's worked, it's always among&nbsp; uh groups of people who already know each other&nbsp;&nbsp; and are working together and it tends to happen in&nbsp; small towns. So, for example, like in a big city,&nbsp;&nbsp; there's a big cathedral with people going in.&nbsp; It's kind of hard to imagine, well, how do you&nbsp;&nbsp; occupy that? And like unless you've got people&nbsp; who've already tried it, right? Where it's worked,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I've been there at these moments, native&nbsp; people just say, "To hell with us. We're going&nbsp;&nbsp; in." And they go in and tell the priest to get&nbsp; out. And in Canada, the advantage is it's not&nbsp;&nbsp; politically very wise to start locking up a lot&nbsp; of native people for just asserting their their&nbsp;&nbsp; land right. And they have the right to seize those&nbsp; churches, the law of reparation. The church has&nbsp;&nbsp; done so much damage to their people that they&nbsp; have every right to take that as reparations&nbsp;&nbsp; because they never got any financial compensation&nbsp; of any kind. And they've been the churches built&nbsp;&nbsp; on their land without asking permission. So that's&nbsp; Chief Kapalano when we occupied the churches in&nbsp;&nbsp; Vancouver. He had filed a a thing in Supreme Court&nbsp; of British Columbia saying they're I'm ordering&nbsp;&nbsp; them off our land at that point. And he made me&nbsp; his legal agent so I can enforce that. That's why&nbsp;&nbsp; the police never stopped our church occupations.&nbsp; I showed them the court order and I said, "We have&nbsp;&nbsp; every right to do this. They're the criminals.&nbsp; They have a policy to protect child rapists. Help&nbsp;&nbsp; us arrest them." And at that point, the police&nbsp; always leave. You know, they don't intervene. They&nbsp;&nbsp; don't help. but they don't hang around. So, you've&nbsp; got a great lever in those situations. And I've&nbsp;&nbsp; seen like there was one uh up north in northern&nbsp; BC where a group of grandmothers went in and&nbsp;&nbsp; during a Catholic mass and they just went into the&nbsp; pulpit and they ordered everybody out. They said,&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is our land. You use this church to kill&nbsp; our people now. Get out." Just told them to&nbsp;&nbsp; get out and they took it over. The Mounties were&nbsp; outside with a little cruiser and the light going,&nbsp;&nbsp; but they never did anything. Right. It's funny.&nbsp; The Mounties would come to me as the only white&nbsp;&nbsp; guy and ask me and I said, "I'm not in charge. Go&nbsp; talk to the grandmothers." And they didn't want to&nbsp;&nbsp; do that, right? I said, "You want to arrest some&nbsp; grandmothers? Like, we'll film this. You guys will&nbsp;&nbsp; be on the evening news. Come on, go ahead." So,&nbsp; you gota you have we have so much power. It's just&nbsp;&nbsp; the frustrating thing is people aren't trained&nbsp; to how to exercise it and and we tend to want to&nbsp;&nbsp; follow an example and you know and that's why you&nbsp; do have to lead by example but we just got to get&nbsp;&nbsp; those stories and those and film those incidents&nbsp; and get them out. We did have that posted but&nbsp;&nbsp; again taken out swabbed out very quickly like the&nbsp; time in Liverpool England where this was about 15&nbsp;&nbsp; years ago now there was a judge imposing illegal&nbsp; county taxes. So the local common law group, some&nbsp;&nbsp; of these people are now involved in organizing&nbsp; the republic um their Liverpool branch, but uh&nbsp;&nbsp; the Republic of Albon in England, but they got&nbsp; about 300 guys together, women, I say God, men and&nbsp;&nbsp; women. Um and they went into the court and they&nbsp; physically took the judge out of the seat, disroed&nbsp;&nbsp; him and put somebody else in and they nullified&nbsp; the county tax and fired him. And the judge were&nbsp;&nbsp; last seen kind of scurrying out of the courtroom.&nbsp; And it's funny because in the American Revolution&nbsp;&nbsp; before the first shots were fired at Concord in&nbsp; Lexington. That's exactly what they did. Like the&nbsp;&nbsp; Green Mountain Boys in Vermont, they would go&nbsp; into Crown Courts, burn up the mortgage deeds&nbsp;&nbsp; because the crownbacked New York finance series&nbsp; were just buying up everybody's land and evicting&nbsp;&nbsp; the farmers. They go in, they threw the court.&nbsp; Uh, and there's a cartoon of a crown judge running&nbsp;&nbsp; down to the ship to get on the boat to go back to&nbsp; England because the Green Mountain Boys had taken&nbsp;&nbsp; over the court and burned all the mortgage deeds.&nbsp; That's the first shots that were fired, right? And&nbsp;&nbsp; um, they knew strike where the problem was. And&nbsp; that's the same thing like 250 years later doing&nbsp;&nbsp; the same thing. You know, you're that's why in&nbsp; in Chile a few years ago, the Mapuchi Indians&nbsp;&nbsp; burned like 25 Catholic churches to the ground&nbsp; because they were seizing the local native land.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were trafficking the children out of the&nbsp; churches. So, the Mapuche said, "Screw you. Your&nbsp;&nbsp; churches are gone." And Burggalio, Pope Francis,&nbsp; was besieged in the papal palace in San Diego. He&nbsp;&nbsp; couldn't get out. There's a crowd of 2,000 angry&nbsp; papuches outside besieging the pope in the palace.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's like, but again, how often do you hear these&nbsp; stories? You only hear it from the people who did&nbsp;&nbsp; it, right? So that's why I I really cherish&nbsp; your u broadcasts because we're getting these&nbsp;&nbsp; real stories out to people, you know. Yeah. And&nbsp; and on my channel, there's been so many different&nbsp;&nbsp; establishments that have been whistleblown to&nbsp; be corrupt from universities to Freemason lodges&nbsp;&nbsp; to churches to schools. Um, you know, there's no&nbsp; shortage of establishments in our own community,&nbsp;&nbsp; courts included, police stations, police officers.&nbsp; You know, there's so much corruption that's right&nbsp;&nbsp; around us in our community. And and I love that&nbsp; reminder that we can do things peacefully without&nbsp;&nbsp; violence, making a point by getting people&nbsp; together that approach things a certain way.&nbsp;&nbsp; And just because maybe, you know, it doesn't seem&nbsp; polite to like go right in and sort of protest&nbsp;&nbsp; against something that we overcome that and be&nbsp; like, well, is it polite what they're doing to&nbsp;&nbsp; kids or is it polite what they're doing? Like,&nbsp; we need to go in and make a difference and bring&nbsp;&nbsp; awareness to this and to also take our power back&nbsp; from worrying about, you know, the nuance of what&nbsp;&nbsp; will people think of me if I take a stand against&nbsp; this in my own community. That's right. you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; and uh you never worry about what's official&nbsp; anyway because corruption exists because of&nbsp;&nbsp; apathy. We help curb the corruption by doing&nbsp; nothing about it. So don't point your not you but&nbsp;&nbsp; anyone who points corruption points at corruption&nbsp; say well why aren't you doing something about it&nbsp;&nbsp; right? It's not it's not just a matter of like&nbsp; the system rests on corruption. The system of&nbsp;&nbsp; greed and self-interest requires corruption.&nbsp; Right? So we morally replace that and bring&nbsp;&nbsp; in people's power governing themselves. You won't&nbsp; have corruption, you know, because you're telling&nbsp;&nbsp; people to go to the high ground and out of act&nbsp; out of your virtue and not your self-interest,&nbsp;&nbsp; greed. And we don't have to adapt to this filth&nbsp; anymore around us. And uh we teach that. I hope&nbsp;&nbsp; that for example this interview we're doing be&nbsp; great to show it to children in school. Show it&nbsp;&nbsp; to high school students. Say start thinking about&nbsp; these things. It's in your hands. I'll be dead in&nbsp;&nbsp; however many number of years. It's up to you guys,&nbsp; men and women. And so, speaking of time, more&nbsp;&nbsp; generations to come. You've been whistleblowing&nbsp; for decades and and working at this and getting&nbsp;&nbsp; other groups to help and and it's been a very slow&nbsp; process, I'm sure, of educating and then getting&nbsp;&nbsp; people off their, you know, off their butts to&nbsp; go take action and especially in groups. Um,&nbsp;&nbsp; talk about what's at stake. What is the time that&nbsp; we have left? you know, do we still have decades&nbsp;&nbsp; and generations or what have you seen in your time&nbsp; and how time is accelerating and how we're keeping&nbsp;&nbsp; up with it? You know, I think with the technology&nbsp; at play and what's going on in the world and&nbsp;&nbsp; clearly a move to create these corporate spheres,&nbsp; uh, run, you know, running the world, um, the&nbsp;&nbsp; whole plan to, um, really turn the human race into&nbsp; functional robots, cybernetic organisms through&nbsp;&nbsp; the technology, it's happening exponentially&nbsp; quicker all the time. And I don't know in 10 years&nbsp;&nbsp; or 5 years it may be so locked in that there is no&nbsp; way to fight it. And I think we people have to see&nbsp;&nbsp; the urgency of this. It's something right on our&nbsp; doorstep happening right now. Because it hasn't&nbsp;&nbsp; hit you doesn't mean it's not happening right and&nbsp; you'll see it hit you when when the knock comes in&nbsp;&nbsp; your door and then it'll be too late. So I would&nbsp; say to people this has to be the priority of your&nbsp;&nbsp; life and if not what life will we have right so&nbsp; that urgency I also see lacking in people you know&nbsp;&nbsp; um it's a matter of life and death now right yes&nbsp; and I appreciate you sharing that too because I&nbsp;&nbsp; think that's we always think we have more time&nbsp; you know but we don't realize how every day that&nbsp;&nbsp; goes by every year they're able to advance what&nbsp; they're doing exponentially because they have&nbsp;&nbsp; more resources and more power. They have more&nbsp; sort of permission, less people standing up,&nbsp;&nbsp; more technology, you know. So I my hope always is&nbsp; that people feel that urgency along with us and&nbsp;&nbsp; again feel compelled to get up and do something&nbsp; about it. Go ahead. They are they are because&nbsp;&nbsp; like we started talking about the new movements in&nbsp; England and America. Talking to those people, they&nbsp;&nbsp; say the same thing I see all the time. There's a&nbsp; huge ground swell of opposition everywhere now.&nbsp;&nbsp; And it's like when you study revolutions in the&nbsp; past, every time like a month before the outbreak&nbsp;&nbsp; happens, people are all saying the same thing.&nbsp; It's not going to happen in our lifetime. People&nbsp;&nbsp; are too apathetic. There's not doing anything.&nbsp; Next thing you know, bang, the Bastile has fallen,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? And I mean, things always work that&nbsp; way. It's it's it's like an iceberg. Most of&nbsp;&nbsp; it you don't see. It's under underground under the&nbsp; water. But boom, one day, you know, it'll surface&nbsp;&nbsp; and sooner than later. And so that's why this&nbsp; knowledge is essential and why we need to organize&nbsp;&nbsp; have the steam and the piston both operating now&nbsp; to get our movement going. Right. Yes. Exactly.&nbsp;&nbsp; And one more question that I had for you and then&nbsp; if there's anything else that you want to cover,&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll give you some. This is good. Yeah. Um I think&nbsp; I always love again learning lessons from you. And&nbsp;&nbsp; of course there's the action that we talked about&nbsp; about sitting idally, knowing something's wrong,&nbsp;&nbsp; and then actually getting up and and trying to&nbsp; expose it or do something about it. But you've&nbsp;&nbsp; gone an extra step to where you're trying to not&nbsp; just expose it but stop it. Can you talk about&nbsp;&nbsp; that transition for you and sort of your mindset&nbsp; in those two different things? Because exposing&nbsp;&nbsp; and stopping are very different. And I think&nbsp; that's where we need to move as as a society&nbsp;&nbsp; is stopping, right? And stopping means create&nbsp; alternative. And we can talk about that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; in the abstract, but it's only in your life&nbsp; experience that you you learn these things. And I&nbsp;&nbsp; made that mistake early on. I thought it was just&nbsp; a matter of educating people. You know, I think&nbsp;&nbsp; the Quakers have the saying, speak truth to power&nbsp; as if doing that is going to get the power to go,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh my god, we're wrong. You mean we're hurting&nbsp; people?" It assumes a moral capacity on the rulers&nbsp;&nbsp; that doesn't exist because a corporation has no&nbsp; morality. It's just about its own survival. And&nbsp;&nbsp; you advance high up in the hierarchy by being&nbsp; like that, by being a functional psychopath.&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can't appeal to the morals. And we talk&nbsp; about that in our handbooks. You don't rely on&nbsp;&nbsp; the system at all. Right? Um I had to learn that&nbsp; the hard way. Uh and I only learned it because&nbsp;&nbsp; everything in my life was ripped apart and I had&nbsp; to create something new. And I think the best&nbsp;&nbsp; fighters are the people who are like that. Like&nbsp; the native people who occupied those churches with&nbsp;&nbsp; me and a few others. They didn't have any life&nbsp; left over. They could take the risk, right? And&nbsp;&nbsp; realize that they had to do it. Um what did they&nbsp; have to lose, right? And I think we'll eventually&nbsp;&nbsp; get to that point. enough of us are getting to&nbsp; that point where our backs are to the wall and&nbsp;&nbsp; like Sunsu says in the art of war, never push an&nbsp; enemy into a corner because then they really come&nbsp;&nbsp; on fighting because I know they're going to die.&nbsp; So, and I think we got to have our sense of our&nbsp;&nbsp; own mortality in this. I think that's why I'm more&nbsp; impassionate all the time because I can see the&nbsp;&nbsp; end of my life closer than the beginning, right?&nbsp; And I realize, okay, every moment has to count in&nbsp;&nbsp; this and we're all going to die. The question&nbsp; is on what terms and what are you going to&nbsp;&nbsp; leave behind, right? Not this idea that we're not&nbsp; going to, right? There's a we all have an expiry&nbsp;&nbsp; date and what are you going to do between now and&nbsp; then? It's going to be in our mind all the time,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Absolutely. you know, and and sort of from&nbsp; my own perspective this week, you brought up Pam&nbsp;&nbsp; Bondi here in the United States and we're sort&nbsp; of facing a crisis as a nation and you're seeing&nbsp;&nbsp; it before it's happening in a group of people&nbsp; who are just saying screw politics like why are&nbsp;&nbsp; we participating in this, you know, but but we&nbsp; are seeing more and more people that, you know,&nbsp;&nbsp; they're having faith in these saviors that are&nbsp; that they're they think that they're electing into&nbsp;&nbsp; office to create change and then they're being let&nbsp; down and starting to question everything. Well,&nbsp;&nbsp; if they lied about this, if they're not, for&nbsp; example, going to release the Epstein list,&nbsp;&nbsp; what else were they lying about? Was the&nbsp; assassination attempt a lie? Was this a&nbsp;&nbsp; lie? Were the other promises that they made a lie?&nbsp; You know, so it is really neat to see sort of that&nbsp;&nbsp; critical thought process starting to infuse itself&nbsp; back into society. But it's just like you said,&nbsp;&nbsp; and I think that you're just such a great example&nbsp; of of words are great, but what action are you&nbsp;&nbsp; taking and what are you actively trying to do to&nbsp; not just educate because people don't know always&nbsp;&nbsp; what to do with education. You know, we've been&nbsp; educating on things for a long time. There's no&nbsp;&nbsp; lack of people that believe and know on some level&nbsp; that corruption is happening. But taking action&nbsp;&nbsp; to actually stop it is different than exposing it.&nbsp; And that differentiation and what you've done with&nbsp;&nbsp; your path, I think, is heroic. Kevin, it makes an&nbsp; impact. It inspires people and it's so wonderful&nbsp;&nbsp; that people like you exist. You know, it gives me&nbsp; hope. It gives me a purpose to keep going knowing&nbsp;&nbsp; that there's people like you out there. And I know&nbsp; that it it inspires people that that hear you and&nbsp;&nbsp; feel relief of, oh my gosh, I can do this, too.&nbsp; But thank God there's people out there actually&nbsp;&nbsp; doing something because I felt so hopeless. You&nbsp; will become your own hero. You will help create&nbsp;&nbsp; many heroes because we all are. We all have the&nbsp; potential within us to do that. I mean, it's just&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just an ordinary guy, but I just didn't give&nbsp; up. And people said, "Well, you're not ordinary,&nbsp;&nbsp; so fine, maybe I'm not." But that doesn't matter&nbsp; anymore than who sits in the White House matters,&nbsp;&nbsp; right? Like that's the trouble with with the&nbsp; people or the problem. Everyone thinks about them&nbsp;&nbsp; too much. They don't they don't matter ultimately.&nbsp; Know yourself and act on the heroism that you feel&nbsp;&nbsp; and and you'll be a hero, too, and you'll inspire&nbsp; many others. So, I'm passing that torch on. That's&nbsp;&nbsp; where we're talking today, right? An ordinary man&nbsp; who has done extraordinary things. And so Kevin,&nbsp;&nbsp; tell us where we can connect with you. Let's maybe&nbsp; remind people of the book recommendations that we&nbsp;&nbsp; talked about and then your websites. Governor&nbsp; and ourselves and um the case for Canada um&nbsp;&nbsp; these get these on Amazon and through my website&nbsp; murderby.com. I'm at angelfire101protonail.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; and do arrange something in our communities&nbsp; where um I can come and speak and also send&nbsp;&nbsp; people to you who are in your area because like&nbsp; I say, I'll be giving you updates soon about&nbsp;&nbsp; this new declaration of independence, the new&nbsp; constitutional assembly setting up around America&nbsp;&nbsp; and the new republic of Albon in England. And&nbsp; then you're also at Republic of Canada too.org.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you. Yes. I want to show um on my channel&nbsp; and there's also a link that I always put in&nbsp;&nbsp; the show notes um Kevin's incredible documentary&nbsp; Unrepentant which actually features him features&nbsp;&nbsp; the voices of survivors sharing their stories and&nbsp; shares about the systemic genocide as well as what&nbsp;&nbsp; what they were doing about it at this time and and&nbsp; the different progresses that they were making.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just an extraordinary piece of work that has&nbsp; really stood the test of time and is still so,&nbsp;&nbsp; if not more accurate and important today to watch&nbsp; than even back then. This was way before its time,&nbsp;&nbsp; the stuff that you were talking about here, but&nbsp; and so timely for today for people to learn from.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I did air this on on my channel, so you can&nbsp; go and actually watch it right on the channel&nbsp;&nbsp; that you're watching right now. Um, and he's also&nbsp; has sort of a more official version that's on a&nbsp;&nbsp; different channel that I always link in the show&nbsp; notes. And then Kevin, you do you do podcasts on&nbsp;&nbsp; so many other podcasts right now, including&nbsp; Sean Atwood, which is amazing because I know&nbsp;&nbsp; that that's helping sort of get your work out to&nbsp; different people in this community on a very large&nbsp;&nbsp; platform. But you have your own show, too. Could&nbsp; you talk just a little bit about that? Radio Free&nbsp;&nbsp; Canada. It's um every first and third Sunday of&nbsp; every month, and it's at uh 12 noon Eastern time.&nbsp;&nbsp; bbsradio.comradio free Canada and we're going to&nbsp; be using that with the give it as a platform for&nbsp;&nbsp; the new American republic movement starting up&nbsp; so you'll hear more of those folks there thank&nbsp;&nbsp; you Emma this has been really fantastic and I know&nbsp; we'll use this broadcast really well yes this was&nbsp;&nbsp; a a jam-packed episode that I think somebody&nbsp; could listen to over and over and over again&nbsp;&nbsp; and a really great one too for all ages like you&nbsp; said you know some of these shows can be a little&nbsp;&nbsp; bit explicit this is a really good one to share if&nbsp; you do have high schooler kids or you know younger&nbsp;&nbsp; generations or if you guys are in any groups or&nbsp; can share this um with people that would find&nbsp;&nbsp; value in it. I would really appreciate that. Um&nbsp; I'll have Kevin's books linked below, especially&nbsp;&nbsp; the three that that we talked about today. Um&nbsp; that way you guys can go empower yourselves,&nbsp;&nbsp; learn how you guys can take action in your own&nbsp; communities, and of course support Kevin so he can&nbsp;&nbsp; continue doing this work. It's really important&nbsp; that we support people creating resources for us&nbsp;&nbsp; and and Kevin has no shortage of them. Um, you&nbsp; can also visit Murder by Decree, his website,&nbsp;&nbsp; um, which will take you to his platform or&nbsp; I should say his page that has a listing of&nbsp;&nbsp; all of his books. Kevin has tons of books.
